You should use a [linter]({{< relref "linter.md" >}}) to analyze your prose.

I use prose linters to:

1.  ensure that I write with a consistent [style]({{< relref "style_guide.md" >}})
2.  catch spelling mistakes

I prefer [proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint) because it includes rules that I already try to follow. There's also [textlint](https://github.com/textlint/textlint) if you're interested in specifying your own rules.
