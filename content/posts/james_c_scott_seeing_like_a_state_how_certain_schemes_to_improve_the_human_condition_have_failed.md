## Summary {#summary}

I can't say for sure whether or not this book is a [branch]({{< relref "branch_book.md" >}}) or [Tree book]({{< relref "tree_book.md" >}}) without having read it in its entirety. However, I've read [Scott Alexander | Book Review: Seeing Like A State]({{< relref "scott_alexander_book_review_seeing_like_a_state.md" >}}) and skimmed the book itself. I think the summary does justice to the main thrusts of the book:

-   [Truth resists simplicity]({{< relref "truth_resists_simplicity.md" >}})
-   The ills of [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}) relate to [High modernism]({{< relref "high_modernism.md" >}}) and, more generally, the reluctance and/or inability of those in positions of power to [Imagine others complexly]({{< relref "imagine_others_complexly.md" >}})
-   States impose [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}) upon their people, lands, languages, etc, they require it in order to function
-   [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}) isn't all bad
    -   People may resist a single system for weights and measures but states which have one are at an advantage over states who don't
    -   A single language enables a cohesive culture within the state (albeit at the expense of the sub-cultures)
-   [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}) isn't all good
    -   Loss of local traditions and ways of life
    -   Ineffective practices and programs branded as "perfect" while based on flawed or incomplete information; see [Chesterton's fence]({{< relref "chesterton_s_fence.md" >}})
    -   Reduction of human life to a handful of statistics (e.g. Standard Food Units, identical housing, lack of private or [Third]({{< relref "third_place.md" >}}) places); see [Moloch]({{< relref "moloch.md" >}})
    -   Enforces a single way of doing X which (1) doesn't allow for different preferences between individuals or groups and (2) doesn't account for how the "best way" of doing X will change over time; doesn't include room to grow, expand, or change over time.


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

I treasure this book for introducing me to the state's (for many definitions of state) perspective in planning and system construction.

OWEN: What is happening?<br />
YOLLAND: I'm not sure. But I'm concerned about my part in it. It's an eviction of sorts.<br />
OWEN: We're making a six-inch map of the country. Is there something sinister in that?<br />
YOLLAND: Not in ...<br />
OWEN: And we're taking place names that are riddled with confusion and...<br />
YOLLAND: Who's confused? Are the people confused?<br />
OWEN: And we're standardising those names as accurately and as sensitively as we can.<br />
YOLLAND: Something is being eroded.<br />

#### Back {#back}

A government's ability to govern, collect taxes, raise armies, etc, is greater when its people are legible. Thus, the state imposes [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}) on its people: standards for weights and measures, names, land management, languages, etc (see [High modernism]({{< relref "high_modernism.md" >}})).

A book which emphasizes the perspective of a governing body on its subjects through [Legibility]({{< relref "legible.md" >}}), and [High modernism]({{< relref "high_modernism.md" >}})
