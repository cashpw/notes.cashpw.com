<div class="verse">

"Hope" is the thing with feathers -<br />
That perches in the soul -<br />
And sings the tune without the words -<br />
And never stops - at all -<br />
<br />
And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br />
And sore must be the storm -<br />
That could abash the little Bird<br />
That kept so many warm -<br />
<br />
I've heard it in the chillest land -<br />
And on the strangest Sea -<br />
Yet - never - in Extremity,<br />
It asked a crumb - of me.<br />
