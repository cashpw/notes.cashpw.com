> [...] a serial comma (also called a series comma, Oxford comma, or Harvard comma) is a comma placed immediately after the penultimate term (i.e., before the coordinating conjunction, such as and or or) in a series of three or more terms.
>
> (“Serial Comma” 2022)

Examples:

-   Incorrect: "To my parents, Abraham Lincoln and God."
-   **Correct**: "To my parents, Abraham Lincoln, and God."

Note that serial commas are not a fix-all for ambigious sentences. They may, in fact, _introduce_ ambiguity (“Serial Comma” 2022).
