SMART goals are:

> -   Specific – target a specific area
> -   Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress
> -   Assignable – specify who will do it
> -   Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources
> -   Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved
