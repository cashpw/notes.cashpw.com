> Magical thinking, or superstitious thinking, is the belief that unrelated events are causally connected despite the absence of any plausible causal link between them, particularly as a result of supernatural effects. Examples include the idea that personal thoughts can influence the external world without acting on them, or that objects must be causally connected if they resemble each other or have come into contact with each other in the past.

> Maybe little Amy gets mad at Brayden and shouts "I HATE HIM" to her mother. The next day, Brayden falls off a step and skins his knee. Amy intuits a cause-and-effect relationship between her hatred and Brayden's accident and feels guilty. She doesn't realize that her hatred is internal to herself and can't affect the world directly. Or kids displaying animism at this age, and expecting that the TV doesn't work because it's angry, or the car's not starting because it's tired.
