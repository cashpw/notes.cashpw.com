## As a tool for improvement {#as-a-tool-for-improvement}

As a rough draft:

-   Reflect on the past to turn it into a series of lessons and shorten [Feedback loop]({{< relref "kileBusyPersonPatterns2006.md#feedback-loop" >}})
    -   Transform one-and-done events into events-with-feedback by analyzing them soon after they occur
    -   Time sensitive
        -   Do the retrospective as soon as reasonably possible. Ideally immediately after the event.
-   Examples
    -   Video games
        -   Watch your replays and identify deficiencies
            -   Compare against replays from those who play better than you
    -   Weight lifting
        -   Record yourself on your phone to diagnose and improve your form
    -   A project at your job
        -   Perform retrospectives at each milestone (which should be small enough to be 1-2 weeks of effort) and again at the end of the project
    -   Public speaking
        -   Record yourself and critique yourself
        -   Have someone be present for your talk (or watch the recording) and give notes afterward
    -   Writing, drawing, art, etc
        -   Have others who can write better than you can review prior to publishing. Expect to go through multiple rounds of feedback.
        -   Take your ego out of it.
    -   [Ceramics]({{< relref "ceramics.md" >}})
        -   Record yourself throwing and critique your form. Send the video to people you respect and have them critique you.
        -   Produce pots and have people who know more than you critique them.

This is all coupled with [Embrace discomfort]({{< relref "retrospective.md" >}}); specifically: embrace looking foolish or like you don't know what you're doing. You have to get over that hurdle in order to progress. Yes cheff, thank you chef; etc.

Also coupled with [Seek out feedback and accept with gratitude]({{< relref "retrospective.md" >}}).
