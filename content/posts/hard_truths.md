This note collects things I consider to be true for which acceptance can be difficult or uncomfortable.

-   Life is unfair; or perhaps better stated as life is indifferent
-   There is no god or other supernatural powers


## Consider creating notes for each "truth" and having this note act as a "tag" like [Favorites]({{< relref "favorites.md" >}}) {#consider-creating-notes-for-each-truth-and-having-this-note-act-as-a-tag-like-favorites--favorites-dot-md}
