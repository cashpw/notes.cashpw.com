1.  Write a &lt;large number&gt; of ideas down without regard to quality. "Here's the magic trick: if you can't come up with ten ideas, come up with 20 ideas." (Altucher 2014)
2.  Pick the good ones
3.  If there are no good ideas, go to step 1

The best way I know to be creative is to produce a whole bunch of ideas without caring whether or not they're good or bad and then select from what's in front of me.
