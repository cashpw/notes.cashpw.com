> In finance, the time value (TV) (extrinsic or instrumental value) of an [Option (finance)]({{< relref "option.md" >}}) is the premium a rational investor would pay over its current exercise value ([Intrinsic value (finance)]({{< relref "intrinsic_value.md" >}})), based on the probability it will increase in value before expiry. For an [American option]({{< relref "option.md#american-options" >}}) this value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value.
