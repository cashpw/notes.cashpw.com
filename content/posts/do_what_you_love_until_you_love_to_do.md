> I often think about the "Read what you love until you love to read" [[Read what you love until you love to read]({{< relref "read_what_you_love_until_you_love_to_read.md" >}})] comment from naval, and this is a good generalization. My experience has been that it is easier to educate a Do-er than to motivate the educated; you have to believe you can Do before you embark on an effort.
