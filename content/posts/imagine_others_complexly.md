It's easy to see yourself complexly. It's more difficult, but also more important, to imagine others complexly.

> Literacy is important. Literacy is vital, but literacy is not the finish line. Literature is not just in the business of See Jane Run.

> Let me tell you what is, in my opinion, the central problem of human existence: I am stuck in my body, in my consciousness, seeing out of my eyes. I am the only me I ever get to be, and so I am the only person I can imagine endlessly complexly. That's not the problem, actually. The problem is you. You are so busy taking in your own wondrousness that you can't be bothered to acknowledge mine.
