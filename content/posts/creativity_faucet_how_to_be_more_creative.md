## Notes {#notes}

> One of the most valuable writing skills is the ability to generate novel ideas.
>
> [...]
>
> Visualize your creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater. This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives.
>
> Because your pipe has only one faucet, there's no shortcut to achieving clarity other than first emptying the wastewater.
>
> Let's apply this to creativity: At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that unavoidably comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting them, recognize bad ideas as progress. Bad ideas are usually the clichÃ©s your brain has been overexposed to.
>
> Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.
>
> Here's my guess as to why: Once you've generated enough bad output, your mind reflexively identifies which elements caused the badness. Then it becomes good at avoiding them. You start pattern-matching interesting ideas with greater intuition.
>
> It's easier to look at something bad then intuit how to make it better than to make something good out of thin air.
>
> Most creators resist their bad ideas and never reach the clear water. If you've opened a blank document, scribbled a few thoughts, then walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you too never got past it.
>
> [...]
>
> Your work starts as a weak imitation. You identify what makes the imitation weak. You iterate the imitation until it's original.
