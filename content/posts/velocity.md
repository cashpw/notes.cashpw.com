> Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time (e.g. 60 km/h northbound).

## Instantaneous velocity {#instantaneous-velocity}

> If we consider \\(v\\) as velocity and \\(x\\) as the displacement (change in position) vector, then we can express the (instantaneous) velocity of a particle or object, at any particular time \\(t\\), as the derivative of the position with respect to time:
