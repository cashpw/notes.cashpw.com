> In logic, disjunction is a logical connective typically notated as \\(\vee\\) and read aloud as "or". For instance, the English language sentence "it is sunny or it is warm" can be represented in logic using the disjunctive formula \\(S \vee W\\) assuming that \\(S\\) abbreviates "it is sunny" and \\(W\\) abbreviates "it is warm".
