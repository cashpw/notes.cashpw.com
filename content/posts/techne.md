> In philosophy, techne is a term that refers to making or doing, which in turn is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root "Teks-" meaning "to weave," also "to fabricate". As an activity, technē is concrete, variable, and context-dependent. The term resembles the concept of epistēmē [[Episteme]({{< relref "episteme.md" >}})]in the implication of knowledge of principles, in that "both words are names for knowledge in the widest sense." However, the two are distinct.
