> In computer science, a stack is an [Abstract data type]({{< relref "abstract_data_type.md" >}}) that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
>
> 1.  Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
> 2.  Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
>
> The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, [LIFO]({{< relref "first_in_last_out.md" >}}) (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
