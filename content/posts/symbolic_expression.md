> In computer programming, an S-expression (or symbolic expression, abbreviated as sexpr or sexp) is an expression in a like-named notation for nested list (tree-structured) data. S-expressions were invented for and popularized by the programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data.
>
> In the usual parenthesized syntax of Lisp, an S-expression is classically defined as:
>
> 1.  an atom [[Atom]({{< relref "atom.md" >}})], or
> 2.  an expression of the form `(x . y)` where `x` and `y` are S-expressions.
