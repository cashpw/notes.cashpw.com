> The P [[P (Complexity)]({{< relref "polynomial_time.md" >}})] versus NP [[NP (Complexity)]({{< relref "nondeterministic_polynomial_time.md" >}})] problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. In informal terms, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified [[NP]({{< relref "nondeterministic_polynomial_time.md" >}})] can also be quickly solved [[P]({{< relref "polynomial_time.md" >}})].
