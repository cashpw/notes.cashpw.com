> The purpose of a [system]({{< relref "systems.md" >}}) is what it does (POSIWID) is a [systems thinking]({{< relref "systems_thinking.md" >}}) heuristic coined by [Stafford Beer]({{< relref "stafford_beer.md" >}}), who observed that there is "no point in claiming that the purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do." The term is widely used by systems theorists, and is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate, or promote it. When a system's side effects or unintended consequences reveal that its behavior is poorly understood, then the POSIWID perspective can balance political understandings of system behavior with a more straightforwardly descriptive view.
