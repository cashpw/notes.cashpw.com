> In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) and [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis), a projection is a [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation) \\(P\\) from a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) to itself (an [endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism)) such that \\(P \circ P = P\\). That is, whenever \\(P\\) is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once (i.e. \\(P\\) is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent)). It leaves its [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)) unchanged.
