[Cedric Chin]({{< relref "cedric_chin.md" >}}), (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chin 2018</a>)

> **The Principles Sequence is a summary of [[Ray Dalio | Principles]({{< relref "ray_dalio_principles.md" >}})].**
>
> Ray Dalio is best known for starting Bridgewater --- one of the largest and best performing hedge funds in the world. The book was then a handbook for Bridgewater employees, but was really a how-to guide to becoming _effective_ at life --- that is, achieving your goals, no matter how difficult things might be. In 2017, Dalio published a paper edition of the book with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster.
>
> Both versions of _Principles_ contain a mix of **rationalist ideas on being effective**, advice on **good decision making**, and some self-helpy bits about **self control** and **self regulation**.

## A note on book structure {#a-note-on-book-structure}

> {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2023-09-08_16-32-56_principles_seq.png" >}}
>
> The book is divided into three parts:
>
> 1.  Dalio's Story — a condensed version of Dalio's personal history.
> 2.  Life Principles — Dalio's approach to life.
> 3.  Work Principles — Dalio's approach to building Bridgewater.
>
> The Principles Sequence is centered around Parts One and Two, the two most valuable parts of the book. Dalio intended Part Three to be a reference — you were supposed to read Parts One and Two sequentially, and then jump around to the bits that most interested you in Part Three. For good reason: not all the ideas in Part Three are universally applicable.
