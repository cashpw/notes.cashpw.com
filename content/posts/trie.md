> In computer science, a [Trie]({{< relref "trie.md" >}}), also called digital tree or [Prefix tree]({{< relref "trie.md" >}}), is a type of k-ary search tree, a [Tree]({{< relref "tree.md" >}}) [Data structure]({{< relref "data_structures.md" >}}) used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings, with links between [[Vertices]({{< relref "vertex.md" >}})] defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed [Depth-first]({{< relref "depth_first_search.md" >}}), following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.
