-   Involves understanding your goals and non-goals and playing the game accordingly
    -   Examples
        -   If your goal is to make money by selling clothing, then a non-goal could be "make the best quality clothing". You could, instead, focus on branding or marketing while producing low-quality clothing.
        -   If your goal is to pass a class, then a non-goal would be to write the best essay. You need only write a good-enough essay such that you pass the class.
        -   If your goal is getting promoted, then a non-goal would be doing each project to perfection. A better strategy may be to do a few things to 80% rather than one thing to 100%.

-   Greedy algorithms
-   Local, rather than global, maxima
-   Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set
-   As an extension: Play to win doesn't have to imply that you're trying to win for winning's sake. It is also reasonable to incorporate play to win strategies to serve a larger goal -- a goal that you set. Play to win strategies do not defin what "winning" is -- only you do. Yes, "scrub" playstyles can win the match but perhaps you're not trying to win the match but rather trying to win a loyal following or aclaim. Scrub playstyles, in these situations, may be sub-optimal. Play to win only requires you to identify the optimal strategies within the rule set, written or un-written, and employ those in pursuit of your goal.

This is one of my [Favorites]({{< relref "favorites.md" >}}).
