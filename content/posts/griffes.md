## Summary {#summary}

Dead links are inevitable if your written content lives long enough online. Include archive links alongside links to off-domain content "(a)".


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

I like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that one could automate via a presubmit step of the publishing process. I've looked around but haven't found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links. I expect that I won't bother to include them so long as I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain content will be present and determined readers will be able to consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.

I also notice that the author [includes (sometimes long) relevant quotes from links they cite](https://www.flightfromperfection.com/the-best-explanation-of-modern-monetary-theory.html). I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the goal of "(a)".


## Notes {#notes}

> For a while now, I've been using "(a)" notation to denote archived versions of linked pages. This is a small effort towards creating [Long Content](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) ([a](https://web.archive.org/web/20190131084052/https://www.gwern.net/About)) -- content that has a lifespan of decades or centuries, rather than months or years.
>
> I think basically anyone whose writing includes links to other work should include archived links alongside the original hyperlinks, if the writing is intended to be long-lived. (And if you're not trying to write long-lived content, what are you doing, even?)

> I was happy to see [Zuck](https://www.andzuck.com/people/peoplewhointerestme/) ([a](http://archive.fo/jPk3I)) &amp; [Guzey](https://guzey.com/why-we-underappreciate-technological-progress/) ([a](https://web.archive.org/web/20191013172904/https://guzey.com/why-we-underappreciate-technological-progress/)) using "(a)" notation in some of their recent work. Perhaps "(a)" will catch on!
