> The recognition-primed decision making model describes what humans do when they are problem solving in the real world. It tells us that when an expert encounters a problem in the wild, their brain observes the situation in a changing environment and immediately pattern matches it against a collection of _prototypes_. If they recognise what they see as an example of a prototype --- even if the situation they see is non-routine! --- their brain immediately generates four things:
>
> 1.  **A set of 'expectancies'**--- When diagnosing a situation, experts will construct mental simulations of how the events have been evolving and will continue to evolve. In other words, they will have some expectations for what happens next. The more experienced they are, the more clear-cut these expectancies become. For example, an experienced firefighter might take in a scene and know instantly where the fire might travel, or how a bad situation might develop. A programmer reading a codebase might find several weird kludges, and immediately suspect a submodule to be a persistent source of bugs.
> 2.  **A set of plausible goals** --- The expert would know what to prioritise in the moment, and what to defer to a latter time. When under fire, for instance, a Marine Corps squad leader would have to prioritise between keeping his people alive, getting to better cover, and achieving mission objectives. His recognised prototype tells him where his priorities lie in a given situation, freeing cognitive resources to conduct other forms of thinking. Similarly, a programmer may receive a set of business requirements, and immediately generate a prioritised list of goals in their head according to the recognised prototype.
> 3.  **A set of relevant cues** --- Experts know what to pay attention to; novices do not. Recognised prototypes come with a set of cues --- for instance, when you've just started driving, you may find yourself overwhelmed with the dials and knobs and mirrors you have to keep track of. After a few months, however, you do these things automatically, and shift your attention to specific affordances in your car depending on the situation. (For instance, when turning a corner, you know to check your side mirrors and you know what to watch out for.)
> 4.  **An action script** --- Last, but not least, if the situation is typical, the expert would have a course of action immediately generated in their heads. If the situation is _not_ typical, the expert's brain would still generate a set of actions, but the expert would slow down to walk through each action step in their head.

> The recognition of goals, cues, expectancies and actions is part of what it means to recognise a situation. What is important to understand is that _all of this recognition happens within implicit memory._ This is why experts are not able to verbalise what they are doing.

> Implicit memory operations are subconscious. Our ability to recognise faces, for instance, is an implicit memory operation, and we cannot say how it happens. When your friend Mary walks into the room, you immediately recognise her face. But notice that remembering her _name_ is a different process entirely: this is because facial recognition is _recognition_; name retrieval is _recall_, and the two operations use different subsystems in your brain.
