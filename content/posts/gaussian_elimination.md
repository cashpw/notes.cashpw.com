> In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. [...]

> To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations:
>
> -   Swapping two rows,
> -   Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,
> -   Adding a multiple of one row to another row. (subtraction can be achieved by multiplying one row with -1 and adding the result to another row)
