> In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the _common ratio_. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

> Examples of a geometric sequence are powers _r/^{/k_} of a fixed non-zero number _r_, such as [2<sup>_k_</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two) and 3<sup>_k_</sup>. The general form of a geometric sequence is

> The distinction between a progression and a series is that a progression is a sequence, whereas a series is a sum.
