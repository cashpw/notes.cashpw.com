[Frank Herbert]({{< relref "frank_herbert.md" >}}), (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Herbert 1999</a>)

One of my [Favorites]({{< relref "favorites.md" >}}). This note, though the citation is for the first book, serves as a shorthand for the series as a whole.

> "The fact that I will commit unspeakable genocide and lead a holy war across the galaxy is very bad," said young Paul Atreides. "For me."
>
> "I too feel morally conflicted by my role in a ruthless eugenics program," admitted his mother, the Lady Jessica. "Does that make me a bad mother? Who can say...."
>
> At that moment the Duke Leto Atreides returned home from a grueling day churning out propaganda to convince his troops that he was worth dying for. His regal face was lined with deep moral complexities. "Ifs tough when you're me and everybody wants to fuck you so so bad," he said. "But that's the price I must pay for the future well-being of my ancestral house." He sighed, deep and melancholy. When was the last time he'd thrown around the old pigskin with his boy? Would he ever get the chance again...?
>
> That's fully-manual ascetic space feudalism for you, he thought libertarianally.
>
> Paul looked around the room and was struck by the sudden and horrific realization that he was the smartest person to ever live, and that even his own loving mother and father could never hope to understand Time Cube.
>
> But that's a problem for another day, Paul decided, not for the last time.
>
> CHAPTER 2
>
> "It's a beautiful day to be grossnasty, don't you think?" said the Baron Harkonnen homosexually as he surveyed the ravaged landscape beyond the window. Acid rain pelted against the glass and melted the flesh off the shrieking peasants below.
>
> "Sure. Whatever," said Feyd-Rautha, not looking up from his sketchbook, upon which he had scrawled the words I love killing and maiming' in large bubble letters.
>
> "A-h-h," said the Baron. "That was a trick question: every day is a beautiful day for being grossnasty. You must learn this lesson well, nephew, if you ever hope to get anywhere in life. Piter, what are you doing over there with that huge and evil brain of yours?"
>
> The mentat violated the Hays Code six times in the few seconds it took him to reply. "I'm calculating a mathematically perfect slur for orphans," he said in a gay voice. "Just as you requested."
>
> "Finally! A productive use of your time," said the Baron, and flipped him off. Without a word, he snatched the pen from Feyd-Rautha's hand and wrote 'and oppressing the populace' beneath the words the youth had already written. "There," he said. "Much better."
