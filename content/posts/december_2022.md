[Monthly newsletter]({{< relref "monthly_newsletter.md" >}}) for December, 2022.


## This month {#this-month}

-   Migrated hosted notes from [cashpw.com](http://cashpw.com) to the subdomain [notes.cashpw.com](http://notes.cashpw.com)
-   Didn't catch up on flashcard review backlog in large part because I added 100+ new cards related to solving the [Shortest path problem]({{< relref "shortest_path_algorithm.md" >}})


## Next month {#next-month}

-   Catch up on flashcard review backlog

    I have &gt;200 outstanding flashcards. Reviewing them all at once wouldn't just hurt now, it would hurt forever as from time to time I'd see a similarly-sized spike of due flashcards. I'll do 30[^fn:1] minutes[^fn:2] of review daily to bring the count down.

    This is important as I want to review new flashcards soon after creating them. Creating a flashcard on Monday and first seeing it in review on the following Monday is a poor learning experience. I'm holding off on creating new flashcards until I get through the backlog.

[^fn:1]: I selected 30 minutes since I think I'd be able to keep it up indefinitely. Some variation is okay but I don't want to get to the point that I need to review cards for 1-2 hours daily.
[^fn:2]: Targeting a length of time for reviews, rather than a number of cards, aligns with [Timeboxing]({{< relref "timeboxing.md" >}}).
