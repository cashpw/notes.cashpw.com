> The above summarizes much of my contrarian world view.  (What else should go on this list?) When I say "X is not about Y," I mean that while Y is the function commonly said to drive most X behavior, in fact some other function Z drives X behavior more [[Realpolitik]({{< relref "real_politic.md" >}}), [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}})].

-   Education isn't (only) about learning things
    -   Signaling to future employers
    -   Building a network of social connections (clubs, greek life, classmates, dorm life)

-   We can do things for more than one reason
-   People tend to say they're doing X because of Y. However, in truth, the reasons are more complex. While they may do X because Y, that often isn't the only reason and may not even by the primary reason. People may do X not because of Y, but rather because it's not polite, practical, politically-savvy ([Realpolitik]({{< relref "real_politic.md" >}})), etc to say the real reason. Or because X is only effective if the true reason isn't said out loud ([Taboo games]({{< relref "invisible_games.md" >}})) In fact, people might not know the real reason ([The card says moops]({{< relref "the_card_says_moops.md" >}})).
    -   That said, it's also not correct, in my strong opinion, to say "People who do X say it's about Y when it's really about Z, so their actual only reason for doing it is Z". No. [Yes, and]({{< relref "yes_and.md" >}}). In addition to. Someone can put on makeup for both (1) [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}}) and (2) enjoyment. The reduction to biological terms (i.e. reproduction, safety, alliances, resources, etc) seems [Lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True]({{< relref "lowercase_a_accurate_without_being_capital_t_true.md" >}}).
-   Employers forcing return-to-office isn't only about bringing people into the office but also about firing those who don't return without having to explicitly do more lay-offs
