## Thoughts {#thoughts}

I've seem content width discussed often when it comes to reading. A width of 72 characters comes to mind, though I'm not sure where I picked that up. I haven't seen content width discussed as often when it comes to writing. That said, there are tools provided within, or as addons for, text editors (like [zen for Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/ui/zen/README.org)) which constrict the writing space.


## Notes {#notes}

> Set your editor's column width very low ... 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].

<!--quoteend-->

> Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.
