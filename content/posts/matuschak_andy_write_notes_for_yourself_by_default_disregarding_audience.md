## Notes {#notes}

> Because [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX) [[Evergreen notes]({{< relref "evergreen_notes.md" >}})] can be used as part of a strategy for writing public work ([Executable strategy for writing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCknixwETdFm1MWdWPwMcXs)), it's tempting to "save time" by writing notes in publishable form. That might mean providing all the necessary background to understand some (boring to you) idea, or self-censoring, or adding lots of qualifiers, or spending lots of effort on clarity. Many of these practices can be somewhat useful as part of your own thinking process---for instance, clearer writing usually involves clearer thinking. But I find it substantially increases the overhead and effort in writing, often to the point of producing blockage.

> More concretely, this manifests as a common failure mode for me when I'm writing notes as part of explicit preparation for some public writing. I'll often try to do both jobs at once. That is, I might be writing atomic-style notes ([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNUaiGAXp21eorsER1Jm9yU)) but I try to write them _as if_ they're sections in a larger essay or work. Or even just: I try to write things with all the context and clear prose needed for an outsider to understand what I'm talking about. Then I often find that I can't write anything at all! Better to write at a level where I can produce something, then use that to lever myself upward. ([Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing ("incremental writing")](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNqLdKMiTo9EHA9EWYGXs7b) [[Andy Matuschak | Evergreen Notes Permit Smooth Incremental Progress in Writing ("Incremental Writing")]({{< relref "andy_matuschak_evergreen_notes_permit_smooth_incremental_progress_in_writing_incremental_writing.md" >}})])

> When it's a topic I understand well, I can write notes for both myself and an audience simultaneously. But that sometimes produces the false impression that I can pull this off all the time! To avoid that false impression, I'll write notes for myself "by default," and only "opt into" writing notes for an audience explicitly.

> 2.  I'll try to do my public writing as part of my first pass on the notes.

> 3.  Why do I often find myself stuck when I try to write evergreen notes as publishable prose for an audience?<br />
> 4.  When a topic is hard enough to distill on its own, the extra cognitive load of considering a reader overwhelms me.
