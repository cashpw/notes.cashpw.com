1.  [Theory of Change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange) by
    Aaron Swartz

    > A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action --- it
    > works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out
    > what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you
    > need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself,
    > \"Concretely, how does one achieve that?\"

2.  [Cached
    Selves](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BHYBdijDcAKQ6e45Z/cached-selves)
    by Anna Salamon

    The idea that my actions are so easily influenced is disconcerting
    to say the least. The author is writing about commitment and
    consistency effects with the goal of reducing their effectiveness. I
    think it would be wise to attempt to incorporate a bit of the
    author\'s advice into how I conduct myself. The most
    straight-forward suggestion is to \"\[t\]ake care never to say
    anything but what is best supported by the evidence, aloud or to
    yourself, lest you come to believe it\". Identifying what is
    supported by the evidence and which evidence is trust-worthy is
    another can of worms.

    Strategic](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PBRWb2Em5SNeWYwwB/humans-are-not-automatically-strategic)
    by Anna Salamon

    > We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed
    > by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose

4.  [Learned
    Blankness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/puhPJimawPuNZ5wAR/learned-blankness)
    by Anna Salamon

5.  [The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction
    Books](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/)
    by Cedric Chin

    I\'m not sure if all non-fiction books could be adequately
    categorized by these three labels. Nonetheless, I\'m grateful for
    the vocabulary to describe books I\'ve read that seem like
    over-stuffed musings on a single idea which would have been better
    served by a short blog post rather than a book.

6.  [What is a Career
    Moat?](https://commoncog.com/blog/what-is-a-career-moat/) by Cedric
    Chin

    > A career moat is an individual\'s ability to maintain competitive
    > advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order
    > to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your
    > ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the
    > life you want to live.

7.  [The Power of
    Pomodoros](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4iLk2rxTguFqHHs3Y/the-power-of-pomodoros)
    by elharo

    > Pomodoros aren't (for me) a means of avoiding procrastination or
    > dividing time among projects. They're a way of blasting through
    > Ugh fields.

8.  [The Monthly Newsletter as a Thinking
    Tool](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TyswYDeub7mxMXCgi/the-monthly-newsletter-as-thinking-tool)
    by Matt Freeman

    This post.

9.  [(a)](https://www.flightfromperfection.com/(a).html) by Milan
    Griffes

    I like the idea of including an archive link when linking to
    off-domain content. It seems like something that could be automated
    through some \"presubmit\" step of the publishing process. I\'ve
    looked around but haven\'t found an addon/extension for any of the
    popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include
    such links. I expect that I won\'t bother to include them so long as
    I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain
    content will be present and determined readers will be able to
    consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.

    I also notice that the author [includes (sometimes long) relevant
    quotes from links they
    cite](https://www.flightfromperfection.com/the-best-explanation-of-modern-monetary-theory.html),
    or even a [long quote and nothing
    else](https://www.flightfromperfection.com/specific-benefits-of-meditation.html).
    I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the
    goal of \"(a)\".

10. [Meaningful Rest](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/29-meaningful-rest)
    by Neel Nanda

    > do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute

11. [Productivity](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity) by Sam
    Altman

    There is a lot of good advice in here. I especially appreciated the
    point about avoiding productivity porn. \"Chasing productivity for
    its own sake isn\'t helpful\". I\'ve done that chase before and at
    best it\'s a time sink and at worst it\'s a form of self-deception.
    As such, I want to be sure to do more than just read the article and
    then proceed with my life as it was before. I\'ve had more success
    integrating change gradually and building on small accomplishments
    as opposed to attempting to overhaul all of my habits at once. I\'ll
    try to tackle one piece of advice weekly, of my own highlights from
    the article, and attempt to work it into my life that week.

12. [Noticing the Taste of
    Lotus](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwdcMts8P8hacqwrX/noticing-the-taste-of-lotus)
    by Valentine

    The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to
    mindfulness and attention. The importance of, and ways to maintain,
    focus and attention are a common theme in several other articles
    recently (at least recent to me and my discovery of them).

    The author\'s follow-up review of their own writing distinguishes a
    few claims made in the piece:

    > 1.  External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are
    >     lotuses.)
    >
    > 2.  It\'s possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can
    >     notice the taste of lotuses.)
    >
    > 3.  It\'s good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned
    >     with others\' goals regardless of how they relate to our own.
    >
    > 4.  If you notice this, you\'ll find yourself wanting to spit out
    >     lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.

    I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims.
    Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small,
    independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that
    practice. There\'s a balancing act between leveraging links to
    other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a
    monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or
    external references.

    As for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has
    phrased claim \#3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes
    regularly with regard to video games.
    [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), for example, is a game that I
    enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I
    would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories,
    throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and
    satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I
    dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with
    Factorio. It\'s not that Factorio is bad -- it\'s a fantastic game
    -- but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and
    hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing,
    that I\'ve realigned my goals around the game and that those new
    goals won\'t take me where I want to go.

13. [Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software
    Developer](https://zwbetz.com/attention-is-my-most-valuable-asset-for-productivity-as-a-software-developer/)
    by Zachary Betz

    I think the author makes a good point. Perhaps I\'m less interested
    than others would be as I\'ve seen these ideas already expressed by
    Cal Newport.

14. [Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become
    Stronger)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger)
    by Eliezer Yudkowsky

    > Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is "strong"; naru is
    > "becoming," and the form naritai is "want to become." Together it
    > means, "I want to become stronger," and it expresses a sentiment

    > literature I've read. You might say it when expressing your
    > determination to become a professional Go player---or after you
    > lose an important match, but you haven't given up---or after you
    > win an important match, but you're not a ninth-dan player yet---or
    > after you've become the greatest Go player of all time, but you
    > still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will
    > to transcendence

15. [Something to
    Protect](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect)
    by Eliezer Yudkowsky

    > The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses

16. [Why You Should Start a Blog Right
    Now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) by Alexy Guzey

    > This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing
    > not only helps you to understand what's going on and to
    > crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new
    > ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.

17. [Making Yourself
    Small](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zMxrkFrB6ka4Lb7fM/making-yourself-small)
    by Helen

    > .. probably the most important thing is your mental/emotional
    > state - a friend suggested "not wanting to startle a small bird"
    > as an mindset to inhabit, to encourage yourself to become
    > "smaller".

18. [Seeing the
    Smoke](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5okDRahtDewnWfFmz/seeing-the-smoke)
    by Jacob Falkovich

    > As Eliezer reminded us, most people sitting alone in a room will
    > quickly get out if it starts filling up with smoke. But if two
    > other people in the room seem unperturbed, almost everyone will
    > stay put. That is the result of a famous experiment from the 1960s
    > and its replications --- people will sit and nervously look around
    > at their peers for 20 minutes even as thick smoke starts obscuring
    > their vision.

    > In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch
    > doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the
    > entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of
    > the lake?
    >
    > Exponential growth is hard for people to grasp. Most people answer
    > '24' to the above question, or something random like '35'. It's
    > counter-intuitive to people that the lily pads could be barely
    > noticeable on day 44 and yet completely cover the lake on day 48.

19. [Be Impatient](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/) by Ben Kuhn

    > Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And
    > across a surprising number of domains, being really fast
    > correlates strongly with being effective.

20. [Attention is your scarcest
    resource](https://www.benkuhn.net/attention) by Ben Kuhn

    > \"The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on
    > focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
    >
    > \<10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting
    > fired.
    >
    > 10-50% focus: "meets expectations," gets regular raises.
    >
    > 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.\"
    >
    > *[Byrne

    >
    > \"50%+ focus\" is roughly when something becomes the top idea in
    > your mind. It's when you start caring enough to think about it in
    > the shower. It's when you start habitually asking \"how could this
    > go faster?\" It's when you get relentlessly resourceful. It's
    > around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant
    > other, although that part is avoidable with practice.
