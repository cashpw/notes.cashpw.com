The Alt-right Playbook is a series produced by [Ian Danskin]({{< relref "ian_danskin.md" >}}) which discusses rhetorical techniques employed by the alt-right. It's primary focus is on building a common language to describe patterns he, and others, observe in the alt-right.

While [Danskin]({{< relref "ian_danskin.md" >}}) hasn't formally proposed solutions or a counter-playbook, I have extracted some ideas from the Alt-right Playbook:

-   [Speak directly to your audience]({{< relref "speak_directly_to_the_audience.md" >}}); don't validate terrible ideas by platforming them to your audience or by debating/etc
-   [Imagine others complexly]({{< relref "imagine_others_complexly.md" >}})
-   [Pursue egalitarian policies and structures of governance]({{< relref "danskinAlwaysBiggerFish2019.md" >}})
-   Prefer the [Duck test]({{< relref "duck_test.md" >}}) to believing people at their word
