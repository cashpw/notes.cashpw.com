> Big-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you're working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.
