Consider a public argument between two individuals. There are three participants: the two individuals and the audience around them -- the public. It can be easier to win the argument, for some definitions of win, to speak past the person you're arguing with and instead talk directly to the audience; [ignore them altogether]({{< relref "don_t_feed_the_trolls.md" >}}).

#### Back {#back}

A technique which re-frames a discussion between yourself and another group to a discussion between yourself and the audience watching the first discussion. Implicitly redefines the goal of the original discussion from "Convince the _person I'm arguing with_ of something" to "Convince the _audience watching us_ of something", which is often a more correct goal than the former.
