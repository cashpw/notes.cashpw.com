> The [Dictator game]({{< relref "dictator_game.md" >}}) is [...] a derivative of the [Ultimatum game]({{< relref "ultimatum_game.md" >}}). The term "game" is a misnomer because it captures a decision by a single player: to send money to another or not. Thus, the dictator has the most power and holds the preferred position in this "game." Although the "dictator" has the most power and presents a take it or leave it offer, the game has mixed results based on different behavioral attributes. The results – where most "dictators" choose to send money – evidence the role of fairness and norms in economic behavior, and undermine the assumption of narrow self-interest when given the opportunity to maximise one's own profits.
