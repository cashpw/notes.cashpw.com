> -   The selection of N-, R-, and P-series filters depends on the presence or absence of oil particles, as follows:
>
>     -   If no oil particles are present in the work environment, use a filter of any series (i.e., N-, R-, or P-series).
>     -   If oil particles (e.g., lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use an R- or P-series filter. Note: N-series filters cannot be used if oil particles are present.
>     -   If oil particles are present and the filter is to be used for more than one work shift, use only a P-series filter.
>
>     Note: To help you remember the filter series, use the following guide:

>     -   N for Not resistant to oil [[N-series respirator]({{< relref "respirators.md#n-series-respirator" >}})]
>     -   R for Resistant to oil [[R-series respirator]({{< relref "respirators.md#r-series-respirator" >}})]

## Respirator for crystalline silica {#respirator-for-crystalline-silica}

> NIOSH recommends the use of half-facepiece particulate respirators with N95 or better filters for airborne exposures to crystalline silica at concentrations less than or equal to 0.5 mg/m3.
>
> [...]
>
> The NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) remains 50 μg/m3 today.
>
> [...]
>
> The improved filtering efficiency characteristics of the particulate filters certified according to 42 CFR 84, compared to DM filters, result in filter ef- ficiencies of at least 95% for all sizes of silica dust; consequently, 100-rated filter efficiency (99.97%) is not required to achieve an APF of 10 in a properly fitted half-facepiece particulate respirator for crystalline silica exposures.
