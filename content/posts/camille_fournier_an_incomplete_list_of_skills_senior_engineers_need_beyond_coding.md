## Summary {#summary}


## Thoughts {#thoughts}


## Notes {#notes}

> For varying levels of seniority, from senior, to staff, and beyond.
>
> 1.  How to run a meeting, and no, being the person who talks the most in the meeting is not the same thing as running it
> 2.  How to write a design doc, take feedback, and drive it to resolution, in a reasonable period of time
> 3.  How to mentor an early-career teammate, a mid-career engineer, a new manager who needs technical advice
> 4.  How to indulge a senior manager who wants to talk about technical stuff that they don't really understand, without rolling your eyes or making them feel stupid
> 5.  How to explain a technical concept behind closed doors to a senior person too embarrassed to openly admit that they don't understand it
> 6.  How to influence another team to use your solution instead of writing their own
> 7.  How to get another engineer to do something for you by asking for help in a way that makes them feel appreciated
> 8.  How to lead a project even though you don't manage any of the people working on the project
> 9.  How to get other engineers to listen to your ideas without making them feel threatened
> 10. How to listen to other engineers' ideas without feeling threatened
> 11. How to give up your baby, that project that you built into something great, so you can do something else
> 12. How to teach another engineer to care about that thing you really care about (operations, correctness, testing, code quality, performance, simplicity, etc)
> 13. How to communicate project status to stakeholders
> 14. How to convince management that they need to invest in a non-trivial technical project
> 15. How to build software while delivering incremental value in the process
> 16. How to craft a project proposal, socialize it, and get buy-in to execute it
> 17. How to repeat yourself enough that people start to listen
> 18. How to pick your battles
> 19. How to help someone get promoted
> 20. How to get information about what's really happening (how to gossip, how to network)
> 21. How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you
> 22. How to tell someone they're wrong without making them feel ashamed
> 23. How to take negative feedback gracefully
