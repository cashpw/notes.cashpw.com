I agree with "There is no meaning to life -- it just is" but don't agree with the conclusions some (gestures vaguely to the current era) have drawn. Some that I've liked include:

-   We can, should, and do invent our own meanings. These self-made meanings are "true" in every definition that matters.
-   "Other people" ([John Green]({{< relref "john_green.md" >}}))
