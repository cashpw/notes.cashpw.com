## Summary {#summary}

Two dominant styles of conversation are:

1.  Interrupt (Church of interruption): Interrupt when you want to talk and allow others to do the same
2.  Wait (Church of strong civility): Wait your turn to talk, and intentionally provide others the chance to speak

The specifics of each style of communication are only relevant in the context of the other.

|             | You interrupt       | You wait            |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| I interrupt | Mutually understood | I talk over you     |
| I wait      | You talk over me    | Mutually understood |
