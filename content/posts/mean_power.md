'Mean' power is power which one gains and/or wields through socially frowned upon ways and means. Others would describe such a person as [Machiavellian]({{< relref "niccolo_machiavelli.md" >}}), ruthless, amoral, or an asshole. Constrast it against ['Nice' power]({{< relref "nice_power.md" >}}). Note that those seeking or employing 'mean' power may act as if they have 'nice' power.

Example traits:

-   Seeks power for the sake of power
-   [Plays to win]({{< relref "play_to_win.md" >}})
-   "What's in it for me?" drives interactions, even 'nice' interactions
-   Not genuine in thought, action, and/or emotion; employs [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}})
-   Plays others against each other for their own advancement

The ideal leader will employ a combination of 'nice' and 'mean' power.
