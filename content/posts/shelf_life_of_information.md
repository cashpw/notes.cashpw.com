The shelf-life of information is the length of time for which the information remains useful (i.e. valuable, correct, etc). The utility of information decays over time and rate of decay varies.

As examples:

-   Short shelf-life: The latest finding in psychology
-   Long shelf-life: \\(f = ma\\)

Another way to think of this is to answer "How much will X matter to people 100 (or some other large number) of years in the future?"
