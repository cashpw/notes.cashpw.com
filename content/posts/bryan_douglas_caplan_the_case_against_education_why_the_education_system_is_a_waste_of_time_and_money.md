## Summary {#summary}


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

The general thrust that formal education is rife with [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}}) and [X isn't (only) about Y]({{< relref "x_isn_t_only_about_y.md" >}})-type cases rings true. However, I disagree with the degree; [Yes, and]({{< relref "yes_and.md" >}}). Education _is_ about signaling _and_ it's about learning, and more. [Truth resists simplicity]({{< relref "truth_resists_simplicity.md" >}}). Viewing education through the [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}}) lens is useful and correct but it's not the only correct lens we can or should use.
