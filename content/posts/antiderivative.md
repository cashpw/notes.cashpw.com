> In calculus [[Calculus]({{< relref "calculus.md" >}})], an antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral[Note 1] of a function \\(f\\) is a differentiable [[Differential calculus]({{< relref "differential_calculus.md" >}})] function \\(F\\) whose derivative is equal to the original function \\(f\\). This can be stated symbolically as \\(F' = f\\). The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital Roman letters such as F and G.


## Example(s) {#example--s}

$$

\begin{align}
f(x) &= F'(x) = x^2 \\\\
F(x) &= \frac{x^3}{3} + c
\end{align}
