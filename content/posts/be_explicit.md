## TODO {#todo}

-   Prefer being explicit rather than implicit in writing, etc
    -   Easier for newcomers, or yourself at a later date, to understand as the context is right there rather than assumed knowledge
    -   Helps to avoid errors because you have to be more specific and therefor may find issues you otherwise wouldn't
-   [Define Abbreviations]({{< relref "define_abbreviations.md" >}})
