> In computational complexity theory [[Computational complexity theory]({{< relref "computational_complexity_theory.md" >}})], the class NC (for "Nick's Class") is the set of decision problems decidable in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. In other words, a problem with input size \\(n\\) is in NC if there exist constants \\(c\\) and \\(k\\) such that it can be solved in time \\(\bigo{\log^c n}\\) using \\(\bigo{n^k}\\) parallel processors. Stephen Cook coined the name "Nick's class" after Nick Pippenger, who had done extensive research on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size.

> Just as the class P [[P (Complexity)]({{< relref "polynomial_time.md" >}})] can be thought of as the tractable problems (Cobham's thesis), so NC can be thought of as the problems that can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer.
