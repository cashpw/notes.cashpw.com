> A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc. The infinite line extension of a chord is a secant line [[Secant line]({{< relref "secant_line.md" >}})], or just secant. More generally, a chord is a line segment joining two points on any curve, for instance, an ellipse.
