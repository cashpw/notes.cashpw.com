> A desirable difficulty is a learning task that requires a considerable but desirable amount of effort, thereby improving long-term performance.

Examples include:

1.  Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards)
2.  [Spacing]({{<relref "spacing_effect.md#" >}}) and interleaving (eg: [Spaced Repetition]({{<relref "spaced_repetition.md#" >}}))

> To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
>
> 1.  The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval.
> 2.  The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing during practice.
> 3.  The task must be able to be accomplished. Too difficult a task may dissuade the learner and prevent full processing.
