A software project isn't done at launch. That said, you should balance these potential to-dos with doing a [Good enough]({{< relref "kileBusyPersonPatterns2006.md#good-enough" >}}) job when appropriate (also, the [Pareto principle]({{< relref "pareto_principle.md" >}})).

Inspiration, and line items, taken from (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>) and (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Ramsey n.d.</a>). "Evangelism, documentation, and polish are often just as important as the core project" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>).


## Documentation {#documentation}

[Write to solve problems at scale]({{< relref "after_the_finish_line.md" >}}).

-   Write outward-facing documentation (e.g. From the perspective of someone trying to use/integrate/etc the project)
-   Write inward-facing documentation (e.g. From the perspective of someone trying to maintain/improve/extend/fix the project)
-   Write on the things you learned by going through the project (e.g. project management, interpersonal relationships, internal politics, processes, programming, etc). You don't have to publish/broadcast these --- they can just be for you.
-   "Sketch out a next-steps document, even if you have no plans to continue, that explains what you would do next and why" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>)
    -   Could anything be rewritten or extracted into a [library]({{< relref "after_the_finish_line.md" >}}), service, pure function, etc?


## Automation {#automation}

Reduce toil for those who will use and support the work in the future.

-   Add metrics (performance, reliability/uptime, errors, usage rate, resource usage) and dashboard(s) to show these metrics (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Ramsey n.d.</a>)
-   Add alerts for cases when maintainers need to take a closer look (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Ramsey n.d.</a>)


## Retrospective {#retrospective}

Hold [Retrospective]({{< relref "retrospective.md" >}})(s).

-   Discuss the project with those who worked on it; where were the pain points?
-   Seek out feedback, document it, and make improvements
-   How would you do the project differently if you had to do it all over again?


## Communicate {#communicate}

They won't come once you build it. They'll come when you sell them on why they should come.

-   "Present the work to other teams" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>)
-   Recognize and congratulate the team and individuals who worked on the project in a public forum ([Praise in public]({{< relref "after_the_finish_line.md" >}}))
-   "Look for adjacent projects that could benefit [and reach out]" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>)
-   Broadcast to the larger community by writing a blog post and submitting it to a forum (e.g. Hacker News, Reddit)
-   "Broadcast an email with the takeaways so that the rest of your organization knows about it" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Henley n.d.</a>)


## Misc {#misc}

-   Fix the backlog of bugs
-   Pay down technical debt
-   Measure the success of the feature and schedule a check-in after N months to guage effectiveness
