Predictable behavior is a boon in the types of relationships I want to cultivate. I aspire to act predictably because:

-   It eases the mental burden on those around me

    Friends, children, family, co-workers, peers, etc, don't have to wonder how I'll react or how I'll behave. They can trust in a consistent version of who I am.

-   It's corelated with reliability

-   It implies, at least for me, good communication

    I've communicated what I think, feel, and what my intentions are and predictability is the following-up on those promises.


## Predictable parenting {#predictable-parenting}

Guidelines:

-   Only say things you're comfortable standing behind; don't bluff
-   Don't make unnecessary commitments
-   Use fewer, more general, rules
-   Follow through on what you said
