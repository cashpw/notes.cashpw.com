A [Play to win]({{< relref "play_to_win.md" >}}) strategy which uses questions as tools for achieving goals rather than solely as a way to gather information. The right question is usually, but isn't always, an authentic one.


## Example(s) {#example--s}

-   "Isn't that where your brother broke his leg?" as a way to push your friend to reconsider their travel plans.
-   "What are you going to work on today?" as a way for a lead/manager to encourage a report to be forward-thinking in general
-   "Which shoe do you want to put on first?" to a child to re-frame the usual "Please put on your shoes" into a question which lends itself to answers which benefit the parent, see [Xanatos gambit]({{< relref "XanatosGambit.md" >}})
