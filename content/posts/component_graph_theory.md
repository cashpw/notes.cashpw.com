> In graph theory [[Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}})], a component of an undirected graph [[Undirected graph]({{< relref "undirected_graph.md" >}})] is a connected [[Connected graph]({{< relref "connectivity_graph_theory.md#connected-graph" >}})] subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph. The components of any graph partition its vertices into disjoint sets, and are the induced subgraphs of those sets. A graph that is itself connected has exactly one component, consisting of the whole graph. Components are sometimes called connected components.
