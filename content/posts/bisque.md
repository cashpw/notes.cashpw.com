> Biscuit (also known as bisque) refers to any pottery that has been [fired]({{< relref "bisque_firing.md" >}}) in a kiln without a ceramic glaze. This can be a final product such as biscuit porcelain or unglazed earthenware (such as terracotta) or, most commonly, an intermediate stage in a glazed final product.
