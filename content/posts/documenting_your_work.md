##  {#d41d8c}

-   Documentation is good when, and only when, it is also discoverable
-   Your documentation is discoverable when it exists where your audience goes when they are looking for it
    -   Commit messages often not indexed in search engines (external or internal)
    -   Agree with "most" that including the raw error message is fantastic; increases precise searchability
    -   The commit message referenced in "most" is fantastic documentation (agree with all points made); however, it isn't as discoverable as it could be.
        -   Better to write the documentation in a more accessible place and link to it (or even copy/paste it so long as you also include the link) in the commit message
    -   Agree with "least" that commit messages are not the most discoverable place
    -   Agree with "least" that tests _are_ ([S-tier]({{< relref "s_tier.md" >}})) documentation
