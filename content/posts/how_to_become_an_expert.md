What's the most effective way for one to become an expert in a subject?

The answer depends on the subject matter. For subjects with a "long history of well-established pedagogy" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chin 2020</a>) (e.g. [math]({{< relref "learn_math.md" >}}), music, and chess): you can use [Deliberate practice]({{< relref "deliberate_practice.md" >}}).

However, that's [not an effective method]({{< relref "cedric_chin_book_summary_accelerated_expertise.md" >}}) for developing expertise for other subjects (e.g. business, sales, sport, art, singing, writing, poetry, etc). For these subjects: focus on [Purposeful practice]({{< relref "purposeful_practice.md" >}}) and acquiring [Tacit knowledge]({{< relref "tacit_knowledge.md" >}}).

[Tacit knowledge]({{< relref "tacit_knowledge.md" >}}) is the "between-the-lines" know-how. It's what separates proficient individuals from experts. Traditionally it's acquired by doing the relevant thing for a long time.

Can we accelerate the acquisition of tacit knowledge? Yes!

Expertise, and tacit knowledge by extension, boils down to [pattern matching]({{< relref "chinExpertiseJustPatternMatching2020.md" >}}), specifically [Recognition-primed decision]({{< relref "recognition_primed_decision_making_model.md" >}}) making via a mental library of [Frames]({{< relref "framing.md" >}}). [Improve]({{< relref "recognition_primed_decision_making_model.md#how-to-improve-at-id-4a42aa6f-413f-4144-86df-5c0f0b174777-recognition-primed-decision-making" >}}) by working through simulations ([Prefer simulations that already exist]({{< relref "applied_cognitive_task_analysis.md#choosing-good-simulations" >}})) or real-world experience (e.g. apprenticeship / on-the-job experience). When necessary, use [Applied cognitive task analysis]({{< relref "applied_cognitive_task_analysis.md" >}}) to extract expertise from specific experts.
