> "[...] the manifestation of traits that are valued or praised in girls. It has a lot to do with how caregivers (including people outside the family, like teachers) interact with girls and how those interactions shape and mold their behavior.”

> Think about the term “good girl” itself: It conjures images of quiet, compliant, pretty girls who take care of others and don't cause trouble.
