> In computational complexity theory, the 3SUM problem asks if a given set of \\(n\\) real numbers contains three elements that sum to zero. A generalized version, k-SUM, asks the same question on k numbers. 3SUM can be easily solved in \\(\bigo{n^2}\\) time, \\({\bigomega{n^{\lceil k/2\rceil }}}\\) lower bounds are known in some specialized models of computation (Erickson 1999).
