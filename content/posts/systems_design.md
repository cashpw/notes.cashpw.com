Systems design, insofar as I understand it, is difficult to define. It's difficult not because no one has thought to define it --- they have:

> Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
>
> (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">“Systems Design” 2021</a>)

Rather, I say it's difficult to define because the descriptions I have read (like above) have done little to help me really understand what systems design is to the point that I could explain it in my own words to another person.

My mind tends to move toward [graphs]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}}) when I think about systems design. The system being the sum of the individual nodes and the edges which connect them. The output of a system for a given input would be the result of walking the graph from some point until reaching something defined as an end.
