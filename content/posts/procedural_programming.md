> Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from imperative programming [[Imperative programming]({{< relref "imperative_programming.md" >}})], based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine [[Subroutine]({{< relref "subroutine.md" >}})]) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC. Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.
