[Monthly newsletter]({{< relref "monthly_newsletter.md" >}}) for November, 2022.


## This month {#this-month}

-   Created flashcards for all existing notes

    One of the reasons [Why I write notes]({{< relref "why_i_write_notes.md" >}}) is to remember what I've learned. In the past, I wasn't diligent about creating flashcards when adding a new note. As a result, there were hundreds of notes with missing or inadequate flashcards. My main goal for this month was to fill in the gaps and I succeeded!

-   Assorted improvements to cashpw.com
    1.  Switched the theme from [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) to [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX) for sidebar support
    2.  Fixed broken Google Analytics
    3.  Dark mode by default


## Next month {#next-month}

-   Catch up on flashcard review backlog

    I have &gt;400 outstanding flashcards. Reviewing them all at once wouldn't just hurt now, it would hurt forever as from time to time I'd see a similarly-sized spike of due flashcards. I'll do 50-100 per day to spread them out.

    This is important as I want to review new flashcards soon after creating them. Creating a flashcard on Monday and first seeing it in review on the following Monday is a poor learning experience. I'm holding off on creating new flashcards until I get through the backlog.
