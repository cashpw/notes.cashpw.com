> Seitan is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat. [...] It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water [[Wash the flour seitan]({{< relref "wash_the_flour_seitan.md" >}})] until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving the sticky insoluble gluten as an elastic mass, which is then cooked before being eaten.
