<div class="verse">

Who built the seven gates of Thebes?<br />
The books are filled with names of kings.<br />
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?<br />
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.<br />
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima's houses,<br />
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?<br />
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished<br />
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome<br />
Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom<br />
Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.<br />
Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend<br />
The night the seas rushed in,<br />
The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.<br />
<br />
Young Alexander conquered India.<br />
He alone?<br />
Caesar beat the Gauls.<br />
Was there not even a cook in his army?<br />
Phillip of Spain wept as his fleet<br />
was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears?<br />
Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years War.<br />
Who triumphed with him?<br />
<br />
Each page a victory<br />
At whose expense the victory ball?<br />
Every ten years a great man,<br />
Who paid the piper?<br />
<br />
So many particulars.<br />
So many questions.<br />
