## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Node idea: Overall workflow for roam notes is to have individual ideas that build up connections over time. These connections form groups from which synthesized ideas can be extracted. The roam notes aren't meant to be read by others on their own -- other should start with the synthesis. {#node-idea-overall-workflow-for-roam-notes-is-to-have-individual-ideas-that-build-up-connections-over-time-dot-these-connections-form-groups-from-which-synthesized-ideas-can-be-extracted-dot-the-roam-notes-aren-t-meant-to-be-read-by-others-on-their-own-other-should-start-with-the-synthesis-dot}

## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Node idea: You think the way you practice.
