Blub studies are the "mundane, ultra-specific-seeming knowledge" (Kuhn n.d.) underlying something. It's the "fiddly technical details" (Kuhn n.d.). "There's a seemingly infinite amount of it, full of bespoke details for you to stumble over, and that makes it, often, unbelievably frustrating" (Kuhn n.d.).
