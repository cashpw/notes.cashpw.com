## Thoughts {#thoughts}


## Notes {#notes}

> If I say, "write down ten ideas for books you can write" I bet you can  easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now.  But at six it starts to get hard. "Hmmm," you think, "what else can I  come up with?"
>
> This is when the brain is sweating.
>
> Note that when you exercise in the gym, your muscles don't start to  build until you break a sweat. Your metabolism doesn't improve when you run until you sweat. Your body doesn't break down the old and build the new until it is sweating.
>
> What if I just can't come up with ten ideas?
>
> Here's the magic trick: if you can't come up with ten ideas, come up with 20 ideas.
