> In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood [[Imperative mood]({{< relref "imperative_mood.md" >}})] in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results.
>
> The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming [[Declarative programming]({{< relref "declarative_programming.md" >}})], which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the details of how the program should achieve the result.
