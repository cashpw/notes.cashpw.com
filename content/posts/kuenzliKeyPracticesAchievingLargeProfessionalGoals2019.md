## Summary {#summary}

> I attribute much of my success in 2019 to the practices of:
>
> 1.  writing to develop my thoughts
> 2.  learning to focus

<!--quoteend-->

> I wrote a lot in 2019 ... This practice of writing resulted in a couple major changes:
>
> 1.  I now use writing as a primary mechanism to develop my thoughts on a subject
> 2.  Writing is now a healthy habit for my professional skills and business

Kuenzli mentions that they "really learned how to focus and extract much more value out of the time I have available". They specifically call attention to four ways they pursued [Deep Work]({{< relref "deep_work.md" >}}):

1.  Removing social media from their daily routine

    > Two 'surprising' things happened when I reduced the Twitter app timer limit to 30 then 5 minutes:
    >
    > 1.  I didn't miss it
    > 2.  My stress level dropped and mood improved significantly

2.  Scheduling their work day using pen and paper
3.  Scheduling important work for the beginning of the day

    > It's only possible to work at peak levels sustainably for 3-4 hours per day. So, I pack writing, product management, product development, and planning into the morning. The most creative and intense work of the day is usually done by the time I go to lunch.

4.  Wrapping up work in preparation for the next day

    > At 15 minutes to 5, I start getting my work to a good stopping point, check my email for urgent issues, then I say this mantra out loud to recognize myself for the day's efforts and combat my perfectionist, always on tendencies:
    >
    > "That's good for today."

I've added an "End the Day" event to my calendar for the last 15 minutes of the day.
