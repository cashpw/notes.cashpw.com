> I always do at least 2 of the same, so I can see where my work was intentional and where it was accidental.
>
> For example When I do sets I make 2-4-6 of the same shape/size/color. They started out being cousins, then became sisters, now they are twins. Knowing I can form a shape with intention was important to me. It strengthened my skill.

> BUT there is a place for 'form-finding' which I think describes how you made these shapes you are showing us. When you sit down at the wheel and let a shape 'become'. I like that too. It just doesn't add to my skill set as much.
