> In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations). For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. [...] If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted by \\(C(n,k)\\) or \\(C\_{k}^{n}\\), is equal to the binomial coefficient [[Binomial coefficient]({{< relref "binomial_coefficient.md" >}})].

To restate the example above of the orange, pear, and apple using the [Binomial coefficient]({{< relref "binomial_coefficient.md" >}}): \\(\binom{3}{2} = 3\\).
