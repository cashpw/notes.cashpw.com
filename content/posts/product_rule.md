> In calculus [[Calculus]({{< relref "calculus.md" >}})], the product rule (or neibniz [[Gottfried Leibniz]({{< relref "gottfried_leibniz.md" >}})] rule or Leibniz product rule) is a formula used to find the derivatives of products of two or more functions. For two functions, it may be stated in Lagrange's notation [[Lagrange's notation]({{< relref "lagrange_s_notation.md" >}})] as
>
> \\((u\cdot v)'=u'\cdot v+u\cdot v'\\)
>
> or in Leibniz's notation [[Leibniz's notation]({{< relref "leibniz_s_notation.md" >}})] as
>
> \\(\frac {d}{dx}}(u\cdot v)={\frac {du}{dx}}\cdot v+u\cdot {\frac {dv}{dx}}\\).

> The rule may be extended or generalized to products of three or more functions, to a rule for higher-order derivatives of a product, and to other contexts.
