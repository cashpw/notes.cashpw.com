##  {#d41d8c}

Intake form for new projects, or at least projects to which I'm new.

Include things like:

-   A three-sentence description of the project
-   Who are 1-3 others who (1) understand and (2) can speak to the importance of the project and (3) my importance in the project landing?
    -   The opinion of these individuals should "matter". That is, ideally they're one or two promotion levels above me.
-   Who are the stakeholders?
-   Why is this project worth our time?
    -   Why does this project matter?
    -   Phrase in terms of arguing the importance of the project to a L+3 who doesn't have prior context
-   What is the timeline? What are the deadlines?
    -   What confidence level do we give this timeline?
    -   Are there sub-timelines?
        -   Assign confidence level
    -   For an existing project: Have we had timelines in the past which we've already overshot?
-   How do we define success for this project?
-   What are the milestones?
    -   Associated deadlines?
    -   How do we define success for this milestone?
    -   Can more than one person work on the milestones in parallel?
-   What is the last 1%/10% of the project? (see below)
