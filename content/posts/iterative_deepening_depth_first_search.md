> In computer science, iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search[2] (IDS or IDDFS) is a state space/graph search strategy in which a depth-limited version of [Depth-first search]({{< relref "depth_first_search.md" >}}) search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. IDDFS is optimal like [Breadth-first search]({{< relref "breadth_first_search.md" >}}), but uses much less memory; at each iteration, it visits the nodes in the search tree in the same order as depth-first search, but the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively breadth-first.
