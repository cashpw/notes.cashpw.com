> [Muad'Dib]({{< relref "paul_atreides.md" >}}) learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn [[Pedagogy]({{< relref "pedagogy.md" >}})]. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn [[Growth mindset]({{< relref "growth_mindset.md" >}})]. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn [[Fixed mindset]({{< relref "fixed_mindset.md" >}})], and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
