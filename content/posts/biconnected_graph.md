> In graph theory [[Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}})], a biconnected graph [[Graph]({{< relref "graph.md" >}})] is a connected [[Connected graph]({{< relref "connectivity_graph_theory.md#connected-graph" >}})] and "nonseparable" graph, meaning that if any one vertex were to be removed, the graph will remain connected. Therefore a biconnected graph has no articulation vertices.
>
> The property of being 2-connected [[k-vertex-connected graph]({{< relref "k_vertex_connected_graph.md" >}})] is equivalent to biconnectivity, except that the complete graph of two vertices is usually not regarded as 2-connected.
