> In [Game theory]({{< relref "game_theory.md" >}}), a [Sequential game]({{< relref "sequential_game.md" >}}) is a game where one player chooses their action before the others choose theirs. The other players must have information on the first player's choice so that the difference in time has no strategic effect. Sequential games are governed by the time axis and represented in the form of decision trees.
