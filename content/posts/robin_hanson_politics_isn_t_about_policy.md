> The above summarizes much of my contrarian world view.  (What else should go on this list?) When I say "X is not about Y," I mean that while Y is the function commonly said to drive most X behavior, in fact some other function Z drives X behavior more [[Realpolitik]({{< relref "real_politic.md" >}}), [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}})].  I won't support all these claims here; for today, let's just talk politics.
