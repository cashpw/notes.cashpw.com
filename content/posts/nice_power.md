'Nice' power is power which one gains and wields in such a socially/culturally approved ways and means. Others would describe such a person as nice, kind, or a good person. The exact definition is a bit vague and dependent on the social norms of the culture within which the person exists. Contrast it against ['Mean' power]({{< relref "mean_power.md" >}}).

Example traits:

-   Not interested in power for the sake of power
-   Genuine in thought, action, and emotion
-   Speaks truth
-   Kind and supportive to others
-   Politically correct
-   Does 'the right thing'

The ideal leader will employ a combination of 'nice' and 'mean' power.
