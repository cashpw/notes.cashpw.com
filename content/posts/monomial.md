> In mathematics, a monomial is, roughly speaking, a polynomial [[Polynomial]({{< relref "polynomial.md" >}})] which has only one term. Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:
>
> 1.  A monomial, also called **power product**, is a product of powers of variables with nonnegative integer exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions. For example, \\(x^{2}yz^{3}\\) is a monomial.
> 2.  A monomial is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the coefficient of the monomial.
