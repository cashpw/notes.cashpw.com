> I met a traveller from an antique land
>
> Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
>
> Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,
>
> Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
>
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
>
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
>
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
>
> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
>
> And on the pedestal these words appear:
>
> "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;
>
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
>
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
>
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
>
> The lone and level sands stretch far away."
