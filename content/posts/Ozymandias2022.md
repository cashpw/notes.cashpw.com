<div class="verse">

I met a traveller from an antique land<br />
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br />
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:<br />
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br />
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;<br />
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br />
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br />
The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br />
