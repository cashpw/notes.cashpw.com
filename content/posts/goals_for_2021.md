The unexamined life is not worth living, [man](https://youtu.be/l2kN7pEME4o?t=51).

These are vague goals, in no particular order, for myself in 2021. I think it would be helpful to break them down into shorter-term and specific goals. That'll come later. For now...

-   Give more time to the people in my life. Keep in touch with friends.
-   Learn my [working limit](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c8EeJtqnsKyXdLtc5/how-long-can-people-usefully-work) and respect it.
-   Become more comfortable [sitting quietly in a room alone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25482927).
-   Notice the [taste of lotus](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwdcMts8P8hacqwrX/noticing-the-taste-of-lotus); live intentionally.
-   Use a [newsletter](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TyswYDeub7mxMXCgi/the-monthly-newsletter-as-thinking-tool), or similar, and [writing](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZJXP_enUS900&sxsrf=ALeKk018Uxd8MrGMD408ZNQF-K2ojSC2kA%3A1609550898080&ei=MszvX8auBI73-gTq8L_IBg&q=writing+thinking+tool&oq=writing+thinking+tool&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQDFAAWABggc0GaABwAXgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjGj5ysjPztAhWOu54KHWr4D2kQ4dUDCA4) as thinking tools.
-   [Document what I do as if I was describing it to a stranger](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24259861).
-   Manage my [attention](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aDtzAZf3LnwYvmBP7/attention-is-your-scarcest-resource).
-   Write, at least a little bit, about what I read.
-   Read more.
-   Keep a [personal archive](http://www.zotero.org) of what I've read.
-   [Remember](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) what I've learned.
-   Continue [studying math](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25595583) and, eventually, ML/AI.
-   Continue [lifting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y0rATMeou3hKTt7yDgbNwvtOitZSVFEbjeZBH3AZ5Gs/edit?usp=sharing) and working out generally.
