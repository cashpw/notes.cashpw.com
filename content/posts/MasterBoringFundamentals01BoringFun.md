## Notes {#notes}

> We go to incredible lengths to avoid actions that we know are good for us.
>
> For any endeavor, there are a set of basic skills needed to build a strong foundation. These are the boring fundamentals:
>
> -   Sleeping 8 hours a night, exercising consistently, eating your vegetables.
> -   Meditating, reading books, writing for yourself and for your peers.
> -   Domain specific fundamentals, like drilling guitar chords, or calculus.
>
> Even when we know they are good for us, even when we know they will advance our goals, we avoid taking the steps needed.
>
> We don't do the boring fundamentals because, well, they're boring. Repetitive actions done day after day are not a recipe for excitement. There's a disconnect between the future positive result and the present slog. Progress often plateaus, and only arrives in unpredictable bursts.

> Ski enthusiast Tim Peck shows us that there are actually two types of fun:
>
> Type 1 Fun: Pure fun, untarnished by setbacks
> Type 2 Fun: Suffering now; fun after the fact, in retrospect
> Not Fun: Not fun now, not fun later, "I'm never doing that again"
