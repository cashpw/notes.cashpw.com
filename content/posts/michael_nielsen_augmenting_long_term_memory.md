### More patterns for Anki use {#more-patterns-for-anki-use}


#### Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible {#make-most-anki-questions-and-answers-as-atomic-as-possible}

> That is, both the question and answer express just one idea. As an example, when I was learning the Unix command line, I entered the question: "How to create a soft link from linkname to filename?" The answer was: "ln -s filename linkname". Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong.
>
> The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: "What's the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?" Answer: "ln -s …". And the second piece was: "When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?" Answer: "filename linkname".
>
> Breaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got right\*\* An even more atomic version would be to break the first question into "What's the Unix command to create a link?" and "What's the option to the ln command to create a soft link?" In practice, I've known for years that ln is the command to create a link, and so this wasn't necessary.. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix soft link in practice, I knew how to do it.
>
> I'm not sure what's responsible for this effect. I suspect it's partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn't focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn't learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus.
>
> In general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It's a powerful pattern for question refactoring.
>
> Note that this doesn't mean you shouldn't also retain some version of the original question. I still want to know how to create a soft link in Unix, and so it's worth keeping the original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from simple atomic facts to more complex ideas.
>
> Incidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn't mean it can't involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the following question, from the field of general relativity: "What is the dr2 term in the Robertson-Walker metric?" Answer: dr2/(1-kr^2). Now, unless you've studied general relativity that question probably seems quite opaque. It's a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you know what the Robertson-Walker metric is, what dr2 means, what k means, and so on. But conditional on that background knowledge, it's quite an atomic question and answer.
>
> One benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply crystallizes the distinct things you've learned. Personally, I find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically) find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I didn't initially anticipate. And that's well worth the trouble.


#### Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations {#cultivate-strategies-for-elaborative-encoding-forming-rich-associations}

> This is really a meta-strategy, i.e., a strategy for forming strategies. One simple example strategy is to use multiple variants of the "same" question. For instance, I mentioned earlier my two questions: "What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?" And: "Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?" Logically, these two questions are obviously closely related. But in terms of how memory works, they are different, causing associations on very different triggers.
