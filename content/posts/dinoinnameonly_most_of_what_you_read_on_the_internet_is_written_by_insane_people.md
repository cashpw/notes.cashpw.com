## Notes {#notes}

> So Reddit consists of 97-99% of users rarely contributing to the discussion, just passively consuming the content generated by the other 1-3%. This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the [1% rule]({{< relref "1_rule.md" >}}).
>
> But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a [Power law]({{< relref "power_law.md" >}}), which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users.
