Deep-dive reading is my term for reading more than one source either on a particular topic or by a particular author with the goal of gaining deeper understanding. This is in contrast to [Shallow-dive reading]({{< relref "shallow_dive_reading.md" >}}).


## Example(s) {#example--s}

-   Reading many/all of the published works of a single author
-   Reading more that one source on a subject
-   Reading more than one translation of a source


## Bibliography {#bibliography}

## References
