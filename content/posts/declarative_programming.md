> Declarative programming is often defined as any style of programming that is not imperative [[Imperative programming]({{< relref "imperative_programming.md" >}})]. A number of other common definitions attempt to define it by simply contrasting it with imperative programming. For example:
>
> -   A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.
> -   Any programming language that lacks side effects (or more specifically, is referentially transparent)
> -   A language with a clear correspondence to mathematical logic.
>
> These definitions overlap substantially.
>
> Declarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed. Functional [[Functional programming]({{< relref "functional_programming.md" >}})] and logical programming [[Logic programming]({{< relref "logic_programming.md" >}})] languages are characterized by a declarative programming style.
