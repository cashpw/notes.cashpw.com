<p class="verse">

Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!<br />
The world is holy! The soul is holy! The skin is holy! The nose is holy! The tongue and cock and hand and asshole holy!<br />
Everything is holy! everybody's holy! everywhere is holy! everyday is in eternity! Everyman's an angel!<br />
The bum's as holy as the seraphim! the madman is holy as you my soul are holy!<br />
The typewriter is holy the poem is holy the voice is holy the hearers are holy the ecstasy is holy!<br />
Holy Peter holy Allen holy Solomon holy Lucien holy Kerouac holy Huncke holy Burroughs holy Cassady holy the unknown buggered and suffering beggars holy the hideous human angels!<br />
Holy my mother in the insane asylum! Holy the cocks of the grandfathers of Kansas!<br />
Holy the groaning saxophone! Holy the bop apocalypse! Holy the jazzbands marijuana hipsters peace peyote pipes &amp; drums!<br />
Holy the solitudes of skyscrapers and pavements! Holy the cafeterias filled with the millions! Holy the mysterious rivers of tears under the streets!<br />
Holy the lone juggernaut! Holy the vast lamb of the middleclass! Holy the crazy shepherds of rebellion! Who digs Los Angeles IS Los Angeles!<br />
Holy New York Holy San Francisco Holy Peoria &amp; Seattle Holy Paris Holy Tangiers Holy Moscow Holy Istanbul!<br />
Holy time in eternity holy eternity in time holy the clocks in space holy the fourth dimension holy the fifth International holy the Angel in Moloch!<br />
Holy the sea holy the desert holy the railroad holy the locomotive holy the visions holy the hallucinations holy the miracles holy the eyeball holy the abyss!<br />
Holy forgiveness! mercy! charity! faith! Holy! Ours! bodies! suffering! magnanimity!<br />
Holy the supernatural extra brilliant intelligent kindness of the soul!<br />
