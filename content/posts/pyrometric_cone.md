> Pyrometric cones are pyrometric devices that are used to gauge [Heatwork]({{< relref "heatwork.md" >}}) during the firing of ceramic materials. The cones, often used in sets of three, are positioned in a kiln with the wares to be fired and provide a visual indication of when the wares have reached a required state of maturity, a combination of time and temperature. Thus, pyrometric cones give a temperature equivalent; they are not simple temperature-measuring devices.
