I [collect]({{< relref "collector_s_fallacy.md" >}}) these unread articles, books, essays, blog posts, discussions, threads, etc, from my various [RSS feeds]({{< relref "rss_is_great.md" >}}) in Inoreader.


### Criteria {#criteria}

I collect things that are time-independent and relevant/interesting (either now or in the future).

Examples:

-   ✅ High-quality material which I'll have a hard time rediscovering through search
-   ✅ Subjects I'm interested in and know I'll read through _eventually_ (e.g. parenting)
-   ❌ Anything primarily time-dependent (e.g. politics and news)
-   ❌ (With discretion) Things bigger than me that I cannot affect (e.g. climate change)
-   ❌ Write-ups on specific technologies I don't expect to read (e.g. latest front-end hotness). I'll look these up on-demand if necessary.
