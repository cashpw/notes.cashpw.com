## Summary {#summary}

> The "big, long list of tips" is simply not a good way to organize information so as to make it useful. What you need is a [...] system.

> Well, consider a real-time strategy game like Starcraft II. One of the most important things to do in SC2 is macromanagement: making sure that your resources are all being used sensibly. Now, macromanagement could be learned as a big, long list of tips. Like this:
>
> -   Try to mine minerals.
> -   Recruit lots of soldiers.
> -   Recruit lots of workers.
> -   It's a good idea for a mineral site to have between 22 and 30 workers.
> -   Workers are recruited at a command center.
> -   Soldiers are recruited at a barracks.
> -   In order to build anything, you need workers.
> -   In order to build anything, you also need minerals.
> -   For that matter, in order to recruit more units, you need minerals.
> -   Workers mine minerals.
> -   Minerals should be used immediately; if you're storing them, you're wasting them.
>
> (Of course, the above tips only work for Terrans.)
>
> Okay, great. Now you have a command center and a bunch of workers. You want a bunch of soldiers. What do you do?
>
> Why, let's look at our tips. "Try to mine minerals." Okay, you start mining minerals. "Recruit lots of soldiers." You can't do that, because you don't have a barracks, so you'll have to build one. "Recruit lots of workers." But wait, recruiting workers and building a barracks both require minerals. Which one should you do? I dunno. "It's a good idea for a mineral site to have between 22 and 30 workers." Okay, you have six; how quickly can you recruit sixteen more workers? What if you have too many workers? "Workers are recruited at a command center." You already knew that! "Soldiers are recruited at a barracks." You don't have one!
>
> Aha, you say, what we need is a checklist of macromanagement habits. Maybe you should put all of those habits in a deck of flash cards, so then you can memorize them all. What if, despite knowing a hundred macromanagement habits, you realize that you're not actually using all of them? Well, that's just akrasia, right? Maybe you need to take more vitamin D or something...

> But no, that's not what you need. The "big, long list of tips" is simply not a good way to organize information so as to make it useful. What you need is a macromanagement system.
