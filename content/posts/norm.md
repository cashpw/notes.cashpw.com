> In mathematics, a norm is a function from a real or complex vector space to the non-negative real numbers that behaves in certain ways like the distance from the origin: it commutes with scaling, obeys a form of the triangle inequality, and is zero only at the origin. In particular, the Euclidean distance of a vector from the origin is a norm, called the Euclidean norm, or 2-norm, which may also be defined as the square root of the inner product of a vector with itself.

## Notation {#notation}

The p-norm of the \\(\vec{v}\\) is written as \\(\\|\vec{v}\\|\_p\\).


## L-p norm {#l-p-norm}

\\(\\|\vec{x}\\|\_p = (\sum\_{i = 1}^n {\lvert \vec{x}\_i \rvert}^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}\\)
