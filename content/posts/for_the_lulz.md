This can be the end of it; doing something innocuous or mildly annoying to get a rise from someone. However, it can also be a [dog whistle]({{< relref "dog_whistle.md" >}}) for worse behaviors.

Saying you've "done it for the lulz" can communicate two things to two different groups:

1.  To those outside your group: I was kidding! Can't you take a joke? It's not serious. Etc.
2.  To those in your group: I'm serious. It's hilarious that anyone would think I was kidding.
