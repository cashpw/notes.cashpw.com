[Meaningful rest]({{< relref "meaningful_rest.md" >}}) is a type of rest which leaves the individual feeling rejuvenated. It exists in contrast to default actions -- "the things that take no activation energy to start, the things [one] reflexively reaches for" (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Nanda n.d.</a>). [Be conscious of your defaults]({{< relref "be_concious_of_your_defaults.md" >}}).
