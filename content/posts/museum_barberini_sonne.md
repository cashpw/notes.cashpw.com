> The sun is a universal theme: for millennia, human beings have responded artistically to the life-giving source of light. In many cultures, the sun was considered divine and was venerated as a symbol of inexhaustible power. It became a prominent motif in painting, appearing in mythological scenes as well as in atmospheric landscapes. Although it has long since ceased to carry mythological meaning, the sun remains a fascinating and compelling phenomenon even in the art of the present day.
