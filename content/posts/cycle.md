> In graph theory [[Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}})], a cycle in a graph [[Graph]({{< relref "graph.md" >}})] is a non-empty trail [[Trail (Graph theory)]({{< relref "trail_graph_theory.md" >}})] in which only the first and last vertices [[Vertices]({{< relref "vertex.md" >}})] are equal.
