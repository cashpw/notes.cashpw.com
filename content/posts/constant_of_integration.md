> In calculus [[Calculus]({{< relref "calculus.md" >}})], the constant of integration, often denoted by \\(C\\) (or \\(c\\)), is a constant term added to an antiderivative [[Antiderivative]({{< relref "antiderivative.md" >}})] of a function \\(f(x)\\) to indicate that the indefinite integral of \\(f(x)\\) (i.e., the set of all antiderivatives of \\(f(x)\\)), on a connected domain, is only defined up to an additive constant. This constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives.
>
> More specifically, if a function \\(f(x)\\) is defined on an interval, and \\(F(x)\\)(x)} is an antiderivative of \\(f(x)\\), then the set of all antiderivatives of \\(f(x)\\) is given by the functions \\(F(x) + C\\), where \\(C\\) is an arbitrary constant (meaning that any value of \\(C\\) would make \\(F(x) + C\\) a valid antiderivative). For that reason, the indefinite integral is often written as \\(\int f(x)\\,dx=F(x)+C\\), although the constant of integration might be sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity.
