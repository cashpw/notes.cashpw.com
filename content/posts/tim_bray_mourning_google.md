> Psychopaths · For my money, that was the center of Google's problem. Larry and Sergey were smart guys who recognized they didn't know shit about corporateness and quickly got into a pattern of hiring and empowering psychotic pricks who were presumably "good at business". Not gonna talk about some of the things I saw because these people are wealthy and litigious.
