> So how do you evaluate the advice you're given? How do you know who to take seriously, and who to discount?
>
> I'd like to propose an alternative hierarchy of evidence for practitioners. When asking for advice, judge the advice according to the following pyramid:
>
> [in order from best to worst]

1.  Tested against reality

    > [...] "let reality be the teacher!" You only truly know that a piece of advice works if you have tested it [...]

2.  Believable and exposed to negative outcomes

    > [...] experts who are exposed to downside risk are more prudent in their judgments and decisions compared to experts who aren't.

3.  Believable

    > Believability is a technique that I've already covered in a previous part in this series: originally proposed by hedge fund manager Ray Dalio in his book Principles [[Ray Dalio | Principles]({{< relref "ray_dalio_principles.md" >}})], believability is a method for evaluating expertise.
    >
    > The idea goes as follows — when asking people for advice, apply a suitable weight to their recommendations:
    >
    > 1.  The person must have had at least three successes. This reduces the probability that they are a fluke.
    > 2.  They must have a credible explanation for their approach when probed. This increases the probability that you'll get useful information out of them.
    >
    > If an expert passes these two requirements, you may consider them 'believable'.

4.  Put to practice in own life

    > This isn't as good as "believable expert who has succeeded in domain", but it's still better than "random shmuck who writes about self-help that he hasn't tried".

5.  Plausible argument

    > This is the lowest-level form of evidence, because — as I've argued before — the persuasiveness of an argument should not affect your judgment of the argument's actual truth.
