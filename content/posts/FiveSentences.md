> ****The Problem****
>
> E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
>
> ****The Solution****
>
> Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it's too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.
