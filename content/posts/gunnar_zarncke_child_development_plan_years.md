## Notes {#notes}

Note: I've re-organized the outline hierarchy.


### Intro {#intro}

> This document describes our plan for the first years of a child. It is based on our experience and recommendations we got/read. This will likely not work for everybody everywhere. If you add up the numbers for more than two children it quickly becomes that it doesn't add up even if one parent takes care of the children full time. There are some synergies between children and one also gets better with practice but we still ran into sleep deficits and lack of couple time.


### 0 years old {#0-years-old}


#### 0-0.5 years {#0-0-dot-5-years}

> The first month is all about getting used to life with the new baby. Only the most important things are done. Otherwise the following applies roughly:
> 1st week: The mother stays in bed with the baby most of the time and takes care of herself and the baby. The father takes care of everything else.
> 2nd week: The mother mainly takes care of herself and the baby, but outside of the bed, but continues to sleep a lot; she may already be taking care of the other children while playing. The father takes care of everything else.
> 3rd week: The mother takes care of herself, the baby, and the other children, but sleeps more often; she may take care of some household chores. The father takes care of everything else.
> 4th week: The mother takes care of the normal duties with support from the father, but still takes one nap a day.
>
> Childhood after the first month: The child must be fully cared for.
> Bathing twice a week (2 x 0.5 = 1)
> Wash 2 times a week (2 x 0.25 = 0.5)
> Feed every 2 hours daily (also at night) (7 x 12 x 0.5 = 42)
> Diaper every 2 hours daily (not at night) (7 x 8 x 0.25 = 14)
> Engage(\\\*) 1 hour a day (30 minutes of which are active) (7 x 1.0 = 7)
> 1 new topic(\\\*\\\*) daily (7 x 0.25 = 1.75)
> 1 course(\\\*\\\*) per week (including arrival and departure) (26 in the half-year) (1 x 3.0 = 3)
> Time spent per week: 69.25 hours
>
> (\\\*) engage means letting the child play or occupy itself or (called active) playing together.
> (\\\*\\\*) see spreadsheet. Topics are activities done or skills acquired, they are done alone or with the parent(s). Courses are periodic activities typically organized by a teacher or trainer.


#### 0.5-1 years {#0-dot-5-1-years}

> While breastfeeding, the baby has become accustomed to meal times. The baby no longer feeds in the middle of the night. It has gotten to know an evening ritual (including bathing) and is put to bed at a certain time.

> The child is dry and clean. It goes to kindergarten at least twice a week.
> Our rule for kindergarten attendance is that it may attend kindergarten five days a week but at age 2 two are compulsory. With each year one more day becomes compulsory.
>
> It can do a "solo course" every three weeks. This is a course it can attend without parents but with some other supervision. Parents take care of round-trip travel and planning (this will change at a later age).
>

>
> At this age, we introduce that the child takes over household chores. The general formula is
> (life-years minus 2) times 15 minutes per week. The smallest unit of chores is 5 minutes e.g. setting or clearing the table, doing the dishwasher, taking out the garbage, later making a bed, vacuuming, doing garden work, and more.
