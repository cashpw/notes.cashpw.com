> In graph theory [[Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}})], a cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets. Any cut determines a cut-set, the set of edges that have one endpoint in each subset of the partition. These edges are said to cross the cut. In a connected graph [[Connectivity (Graph theory)]({{< relref "connectivity_graph_theory.md" >}})], each cut-set determines a unique cut, and in some cases cuts are identified with their cut-sets rather than with their vertex partitions.
