> The X-Y Problem, as it is sometimes called, occurs when a person tries to solve a problem on their own, pursues a method that seems like a promising approach, gets stuck, and then asks for help with their chosen method (instead of asking for help with the original problem).
>
> In reality, the method on which they got stuck may be the longest/most complicated route to the answer. The best way to solve the problem is to start over.
>
> In other words:
>
> 1.  User wants to do X.
> 2.  User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
> 3.  User doesn't know how to do Y either.
> 4.  User asks for help with Y.
> 5.  Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
> 6.  After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y was a dead end.

> The [XY](http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341) [problem](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem) is asking about your attempted _solution_ rather than your _actual problem._

> That is, you are trying to solve problem _X_, and you think solution _Y_ would work, but instead of asking about _X_ when you run into trouble, you ask about _Y._
