Abbreviations, initialisms, and other short-forms can be can confuse those without context. [Be explicit]({{< relref "be_explicit.md" >}}) to avoid such confusion:

1.  Use the long-form once, followed by the abbreviation in parenthesis, then use the short-form.

    > Arrakis, also known as (AKA) Dune, ...
    >
    > ...
    >
    > Leto Atreides the Second, aka God-Emperor, ...

2.  Provide context around the short-form. E.g. a link, footnote, [HTML abbr tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr), etc.

    > Arrakis, [AKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aka) Dune, is the desert world at the center of the Dune series by [Frank Herbert]({{< relref "frank_herbert.md" >}}).

3.  Avoid the short-form. Instead, use the long-form exclusively.

    > Arrakis, also known as Dune, ...
    >
    > ...
    >
    > Leto Atreides the Second, also known as God-Emperor, ...
