In that period, he signed up more than 100,000 customers. _Source: [Electronic Value Exchange](https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Value-Exchange-Origins-Computing/dp/1849961387)_.

> -   **Marinship.** "Shipyard construction was begun promptly after a telegram from the United States Maritime Commission was received by the W. A. Bechtel Company. The telegram was received on 2 March 1942, the Sausalito site selected on 3 March, and a proposal to build the shipyard presented in Washington DC was made on 9 March. Ten minutes into the presentation U. S. Maritime Commission administrators told the W.A. Bechtel Company to build the shipyard. Physical construction began on 28 March. Construction start was delayed two weeks to allow the 42 families living on Pine Point, which was scheduled to be demolished to build the shipyard, to move." The first ship was completed on September 15 of that year, 197 days after receiving the telegram. _Source: [Marinship on the Fast Track](http://www.sausalitohistoricalsociety.com/2019-columns/2019/1/23/marinship-on-the-fast-track)._
> -   **The Spirit of St. Louis.** In 1927, Donald Hall and Charles Lindbergh designed and built _Spirit_ in 60 days. "To determine the amount of fuel the plane would need, Lindbergh and Hall drove to the San Diego Public Library at 820 E St. Using a globe and a piece of string, Lindbergh estimated the distance from New York to Paris. It came out to 3,600 statute miles, which Hall calculated would require 400 gallons of gas." _Source: [Ryan Airlines gave Lindbergh wings](http://www.sandiegoyesterday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/lindbergh.pdf)._
> -   **The Eiffel Tower.** The Eiffel Tower was built in 2 years and 2 months; that is, in 793 days.

> -   **The Pentagon.** The construction of the world's largest office building was led by Brehon Somervell. The decision to proceed with the project was made on a Thursday evening. Initial drawings were completed that Sunday. Construction started two months later, on September 11 1941, and was finished on January 15 1943, 491 days later. When asked when something was needed, Somervell's go-to response was "the day before yesterday". _Source: [The Pentagon](https://www.amazon.com/Pentagon-History-Steve-Vogel/dp/0812973259)._

In April 2000, the MTA decided to build the Second Avenue Subway. The first phase, with 3 stations, opened on January 1 2017. _Source: [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1904/10/28/archives/our-subway-open-150000-try-it-mayor-mcclellan-runs-the-first.html&legacy=true)._
> -   **TGV.** On April 30 1976, the French government approved a plan to build a high-speed rail link between Paris and Lyon, the first high-speed rail line in Europe. This line was to use completely new electric locomotives, also to be developed in France as part of the project. The ensuing line opened on September 26 1981, 1,975 days later. On September 24 1996, the California High-Speed Rail Authority was formed. The completion of the first phase of California's high-speed rail project, a line connecting San Francisco and Anaheim, is currently estimated to happen in 2033, 37 years (i.e. around 13,000 days) after the authority was formed. _Source: [On the Fast Track](https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Track-Railway-Modernization-1944-1983-dp-0275973778/dp/0275973778)._

> -   **Xerox Alto.** Work on the Xerox Alto, the first GUI-oriented computer, started in November 1972 because of a bet: "Chuck said that a futuristic computer could be done 'in three months' and a Xerox exec bet him a case of wine that it couldn't be done". Building the Alto required extensive hardware, operating system, and application [design](https://patrickcollison.com/static/files/alto.pdf) and implementation. The first complete Altos were introduced on March 1 1973. _Source: [Alan Kay](https://www.quora.com/How-was-the-Xerox-Alto-done-in-only-3-months/answer/Alan-Kay-11)._

> -   **COVID-19 vaccines.** On January 10 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was [published](https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319). 3 days later, Moderna [finalized](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) the sequence for [mRNA-1273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna#COVID-19_vaccine_candidate), its mRNA vaccine candidate; the first batch was manufactured on February 7. On February 24 (45 days after genome publication), Moderna shipped the first batch of mRNA-1273 to the NIH for use in their Phase 1 clinical study. 266 days of clinical trials and regulatory coordination followed. On November 16, Moderna [announced](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy) that the vaccine's efficacy was 94.5%. _Source: linked materials. Note: the BioNTech vaccine was produced on a similarly impressive timeline but I haven't yet tracked down sufficiently granular information about its development---pointers appreciated._

> San Francisco proposed a [new bus lane](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/two-mile-long-van-ness-bus-lane-project-faces-two-year-delay/) on Van Ness in 2001. It opened in [2022](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/S-F-s-Van-Ness-transit-project-is-ready-after-17027218.php), yielding a project duration of around 7,600 days. "The project has been delayed due to an increase of wet weather since the project started," said Paul Rose, a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency spokesperson. The project cost $346 million, i.e. $110,000 per meter. The Alaska Highway, mentioned above, constructed across remote tundra, cost $793 per meter in 2019 dollars.
