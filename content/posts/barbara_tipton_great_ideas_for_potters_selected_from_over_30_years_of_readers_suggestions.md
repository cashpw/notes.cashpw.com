### Clay forming processes {#clay-forming-processes}


#### Clay {#clay}

-  Shrinkage

    > **To determine the percent** of shrinkage in a clay body, roll out a small slab slightly over 10 centimeters long. Press a plastic ruler (with raised numerals [...]) into the clay from 0 to 10 centimeters. Even backwards, the numbers can be read easily. Then fire the slab as usual. With the ruler, measure the amount that the 10-centimeter length has shrunk. If it is 1 centimeter shorter, then the amount of shrinkage is 10%, and so forth.


#### Handbuilding {#handbuilding}


#### Throwing {#throwing}

-  Throwing techniques

    > **Place a mirror** in front of the wheel to reflect the wheel head. This is an invaluable aid when studying hand positions; it also makes it easier to compare them with photos when using a book as a guide. This process is also useful for viewing the pot as it is being made on the wheel, since it abolishes the necessiyt for the potter to step back to get a good view.

    > **Centering with eyes closed** is a useful teaching exercise for beginning potters. It helps them to regocnize that centering is first a tactile and then a visual process.
