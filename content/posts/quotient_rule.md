> In calculus [[Calculus]({{< relref "calculus.md" >}})], the quotient rule is a method of finding the derivative [[Derivative (math)]({{< relref "derivative.md" >}})] of a function that is the ratio of two differentiable functions. Let \\(\displaystyle h(x)=f(x)/g(x)\\), where both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are differentiable and \\(\displaystyle g(x)\neq 0\\). The quotient rule states that the derivative of \\(h(x)\\) is

This is one of the rules of [Differentiation]({{< relref "differential_calculus.md" >}}).
