> In mathematics, a linear map or linear function f(x) is a function that satisfies the two properties:[1]
>
> -   Additivity [[Additivity]({{< relref "additivity.md" >}})]: f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).
> -   Homogeneity [[Homogeneity]({{< relref "homogeneity.md" >}})] of degree 1: f(αx) = α f(x) for all α.
>
> These properties are known as the superposition principle. In this definition, x is not necessarily a real number, but can in general be an element of any vector space.
