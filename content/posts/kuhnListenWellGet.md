[Ben Kuhn]({{< relref "ben_kuhn.md" >}}), (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Kuhn n.d.</a>)


## Summary {#summary}

[Curiosity]({{< relref "be_curious.md" >}}) should underlie a listener's behavior in conversations.


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

Listening well, and asking curious questions, ensures you [understand the problem]({{< relref "stages_of_problem_solving.md#understand-and-agree-about-the-problem" >}}).

I find that my misunderstandings are the result of premature and ill-founded assumptions on my part. There is a balancing act to maintain between [reasoning from analogy]({{< relref "reasoning_from_analogy.md" >}}) and [reasoning from first principles]({{< relref "reasoning_from_first_principles.md" >}}).


## Notes {#notes}

> Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners do often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it's cargo cult advice: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what's actually important, the thing that's generating that surface appearance.

> When I've listened the most effectively to people, it's because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a detailed, precise understanding of what was going on in their head.

<!--quoteend-->

> It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I'm usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I'm talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.
