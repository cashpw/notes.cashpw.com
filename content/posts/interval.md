> In mathematics, a (real) interval is a set of real numbers that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the set. For example, the set of numbers x satisfying \\(0 \leq x \leq 1\\) is an interval which contains 0, 1, and all numbers in between. Other examples of intervals are the set of numbers such that \\(0 \lt x \lt 1\\), the set of all real numbers \\(\mathbb{R}\\), the set of nonnegative real numbers, the set of positive real numbers, the empty set, and any singleton (set of one element).
