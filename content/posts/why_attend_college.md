I may reformat this note by compressing in into a larger one or splitting it up further. It's the best place I have for the moment.

In no particular order:

-   Community, social skills, comraderie, networking, friends
-   Access to speicfic people, resources, tools, clubs, networks, etc
    -   This can include the education itself, though most of that is available without attending a university
-   [Signaling]({{< relref "signaling.md" >}}) (see [Bryan Caplan | The Case against Education]({{< relref "bryan_douglas_caplan_the_case_against_education_why_the_education_system_is_a_waste_of_time_and_money.md" >}})); employers are more interested in those with a degree
-   External motivation or accountability; some people benefit more from external pressures (e.g. tests, assignments, an actual instructor who looks them in the eye) than others

Why not attend?

-   Expense
-   Time commitment; you can drive your own learning faster (see [There's no speed limit]({{< relref "there_s_no_speed_limit.md" >}}))

Note that there's nothing stopping you from attending a university _and_ driving your own education. It'll take more work but it's possible. You don't only have to learn things that you're told to learn.
