> The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s onward in psychological trait theory.

> Starting in the 1990s, the theory identified five factors by labels, for the US English population, typically referred to as:
>
> 1.  openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
> 2.  conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
> 3.  extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
> 4.  agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
> 5.  neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)
