<div class="verse">

All that is gold does not glitter,<br />
Not all those who wander are lost;<br />
The old that is strong does not wither,<br />
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br />
<br />
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br />
A light from the shadows shall spring;<br />
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br />
The crownless again shall be king.<br />

</div>
