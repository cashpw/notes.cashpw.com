> In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of indeterminates (also called variables) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and positive-integer powers of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate \\(x\\) is \\(x^{2} − 4x + 7\\). An example with three indeterminates is \\(x^{3} + 2xyz^{2} − yz + 1\\).

## Degree {#degree}

> In mathematics, the degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of the polynomial's monomials (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it, and thus is a non-negative integer.
