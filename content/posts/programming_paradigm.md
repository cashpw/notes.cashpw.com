> Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
>
> [...]
>
> Some common programming paradigms are,
>
> -   imperative [[Imperative programming]({{< relref "imperative_programming.md" >}})] in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
>     -   procedural [[Procedural programming]({{< relref "procedural_programming.md" >}})] which groups instructions into procedures,
>     -   object-oriented [[Object-oriented programming]({{< relref "object_oriented_programming.md" >}})] which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,
> -   declarative [[Declarative programming]({{< relref "declarative_programming.md" >}})] in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
>     -   functional [[Functional programming]({{< relref "functional_programming.md" >}})] in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
>     -   logic [[Logic programming]({{< relref "logic_programming.md" >}})] in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
>     -   mathematical [[Mathematical programming]({{< relref "mathematical_programming.md" >}})] in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
>     -   reactive [[Reactive programming]({{< relref "reactive_programming.md" >}})] in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
