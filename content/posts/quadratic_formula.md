> In elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is a formula that provides the solution(s) to a quadratic equation. [...]
>
> Given a general quadratic equation of the form
>
> \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\)
>
> with x representing an unknown, with a, b and c representing constants, and with a ≠ 0, the quadratic formula is:
>
> \\(x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\\)
>
> where the plus–minus symbol "±" indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions.[1] Written separately, they become:
>
> \\(\displaystyle x\_{1}={\frac {-b+{\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\quad {\text{or}}\quad x\_{2}={\frac {-b-{\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\\)
