## My preferred {#my-preferred}

> [Pistol Squat Tutorial - Single-Leg Strength &amp; Balance](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0XP1ty4C0)
>
> 1.  Deep Squat
>     -   Start by making sure you can get into a deep squat, bringing your butt close to your heels while keeping a straight back.
>     -   Work on that until you are ready to move on to the next step.
> 2.  Roll Back
>     -   Grab your ankles in the squat position and roll back, letting your butt come off the ground a bit.
> 3.  Roll Back Up Into the Squat
>     -   Holding on to your ankles, roll your body back up into a deep squat position.
>     -   Work on this progression until you feel comfortable enough to move on.
> 4.  Extend One Leg
>     -   Roll your body up into a squat position, but this time, keep one leg straight, and pop up very slightly with your bent leg.
> 5.  Pop Up to Standing
>     -   Work on popping up a little higher each time you roll up, until you can pop all the way up into a standing position.
> 6.  Reverse Direction
>     -   Next, you'll go in the opposite direction: Stand up and squat back, keeping one leg straight, then roll back into a supine position.
> 7.  Do a Full Pistol Squat
>     -   Work on the previous progression until you can squat down with control, and stand back up with control.
