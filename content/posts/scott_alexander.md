I've engaged with their writing as much as I have because:

-   Their posts have introduced me to concepts and ways of thinking I hadn't previously known about
-   Their writing style is enjoyable to read, for me at least. It feels conversational.
-   They came broadly recommended by groups I had previously frequented (e.g. hackernews)

That said, I want to emphasize both that (1) my enjoyment of _some_ of their work doesn't imply that I agree with their _entire_ body of work and (2) I don't identify with the community they broadly fit into (Rationalists; related: [LessWrong]({{< relref "lesswrong.md" >}})). I'd say this is true for everything I document in this notebook. The authors I've found which appear to sit beneath the "Rationalist" banner have been the source of a lot of good learning for me:

-   [Notice the taste of lotus]({{< relref "valentineNoticingTasteLotus2018.md" >}})
-   [Anna Salamon | Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic]({{< relref "annasalamonHumansAreNot2010.md" >}})
-   [Scott Alexander | Meditations On Moloch]({{< relref "alexanderMeditationsMoloch2014.md" >}})
-   [Akrasia]({{< relref "akrasia.md" >}})
-   Etc
