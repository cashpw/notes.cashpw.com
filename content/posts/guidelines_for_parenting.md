I've titled this "Guidelines" as opposed to "Rules" because:

1.  No two children are the same and they each benefit from an individualized approach. That said, [most of this is applicable to most children]({{< relref "pareto_principle.md" >}}).
2.  You need to respond to unpredictable or uncommon conditions and rules are too brittle
