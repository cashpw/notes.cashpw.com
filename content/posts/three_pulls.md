Three pulls is a production / efficient [Pottery]({{< relref "ceramics.md" >}}) technique for wheel throwing in which one pulls the form to its full height in only three pulls:

1.  Normal pull; pull as you normally would using your fingers or a sponge, etc
2.  Normal pull
3.  Rib pull; pull up with a wooden/etc rib on the outside

    In this way you pull and remove excess slip in the same movement.
