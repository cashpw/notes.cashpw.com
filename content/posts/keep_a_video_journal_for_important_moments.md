Create video journal entries (by yourself or as a group) to capture important recent experiences.

My wife's best friend recommended we try this on our honeymoon and it was the best gift she's given us. We have a half-dozen or so videos which capture details we've since forgotten and bring us right back to a particular day of travel when we watch them together!


## Guidelines {#guidelines}

1.  &lt;4 minutes (see [Write prolifically, write succinctly]({{< relref "write_prolifically_write_succinctly.md" >}}))

    Take a few minutes before recording, if necessary, to think about what you want to include. Write them down if that helps!

2.  Record as soon after the event as possible --- ideally while you're still on location!


## When? {#when}

I keep a written journal for daily "mundane" entries. These video journals are higher-fidelity and can easily involve more than just myself. I try to use them with that in mind. The primary way I use them is periodically, to track a particular thing over time:

-   Every night while on a [trip]({{< relref "trip.md" >}})
-   Every week while you're working on a home renovation project to see how it evolved
-   Every month with your children as they're growing up

I haven't done so yet, but I could see creating ad-hoc entries as well:

-   You figured out a new recipe
-   Finished decorating for a party
-   Adopting a new pet
-   Moving into a new home
-   Birth in the family
