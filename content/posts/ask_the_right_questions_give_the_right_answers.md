A [Play to win]({{< relref "play_to_win.md" >}}) strategy which uses answers as tools for achieving goals rather than solely as a way to gather information. The right answer is usually, but isn't always, an authentic one.


## Example(s) {#example--s}

-   "Good." as an answer to "How's it going?" to avoid getting into the weeds on how it's actually going for you.
-   "&lt;a strength&gt;" as an anser to "What's your greatest weakness?"
-   "&lt;their favorite restraunt&gt;" as an answer to "Where do you want to go to eat?"
