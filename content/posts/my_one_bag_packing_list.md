This is my current [One-bag travel]({{< relref "one_bag_travel.md" >}}) packing list. The guiding concepts are:

1.  Think in [Permutations]({{< relref "permutation.md" >}})

    Two tops and two bottoms makes four looks!

    Example: [Travel clothing permutations](/ox-hugo/2023-08-20_08-33-51_9d8tx43oba3b1.jpg)

2.  Prefer solids to liquids

    The USA's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that "[e]ach passenger may carry liquids, gels and aerosols in travel-size containers that are 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters. Each passenger is limited to one quart-size bag of liquids, gels and aerosols" (NO_ITEM_DATA:transportationsecurityadministrationWhat311LiquidsRule).

    Example: Bar soap rather than liquid soap

3.  Multi-purpose

    Example: A [gaiter](https://amazon.com/dp/B009VU2TQI) serves as a [scarf, face covering, headband, balaclava, sleep mask, and more!](/ox-hugo/2023-08-20_08-46-26_71DjeJf2umS._AC_UX679_.jpg)


## Packing list {#packing-list}


### Clothing {#clothing}

I pack with the expectation that I'll do laundry every 5 days and will wear things more than once before washing them (except underwear). This allows me to pack less clothing and overall keep weight down.

## Changelog {#changelog}

See [Semantic versioning]({{< relref "semantic_versioning.md" >}}).

-   1.0.2: Extended (no replacements) based on recent [Italy]({{< relref "italy_2023.md" >}}) trip

-   1.0.1: Replace Western Rise Diversion pant with [Greg Norman Men's 5 Pocket Travel Pants](https://www.costco.com/greg-norman-men%E2%80%99s-5-pocket-travel-pant-.product.100645822.html)

    The Western Rise pants were good quality. However, they didn't look flattering on me. I switched them out for pants I found at Costco which felt similar (textile and weight) and were much cheaper (~$15 vs ~$160).

-   1.0.0: Based on extensive reading on [r/onebag](http://reddit.com/r/onebag) and linked sites including (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Maluf n.d.</a>)
