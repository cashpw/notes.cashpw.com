Plaster is useful in [Ceramics]({{< relref "how_to_pour_plaster.md" >}}) for drying overly-wet plastic (reclaim) clay.


## Bubbles {#bubbles}

> Try to pour it into the corner of the plastic box.  This reduces the amount of air that gets dragged into the plaster mix.  Think about pouring a fizzy drink into a glass.  If you pour it straight into the center of the glass, it gets agitated and bubbles up.  However, if you pour it against the side of the glass it will settle more easily.

It works well and means you don't have to rub the surface down so much later.
