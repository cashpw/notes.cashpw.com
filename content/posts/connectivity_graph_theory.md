> In an undirected graph [[Undirected graph]({{< relref "undirected_graph.md" >}})] \\(G\\), two vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are called connected if \\(G\\) contains a path [[Path (graph theory)]({{< relref "path_graph_theory.md" >}})] from \\(u\\) to \\(v\\). Otherwise, they are called disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length 1, i.e. by a single edge, the vertices are called adjacent.

## Connected graph {#connected-graph}

> A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices.

## Disconnected graph {#disconnected-graph}

> An undirected graph that is not connected is called disconnected.

## Weakly connected graph {#weakly-connected-graph}

> A directed graph [[Directed graph]({{< relref "directed_graph.md" >}})] is called weakly connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph [[Connected graph](#connected-graph)].

## Unilaterally connected graph {#unilaterally-connected-graph}

> [A [Directed graph]({{< relref "directed_graph.md" >}})] is unilaterally connected or unilateral (also called semiconnected) if it contains a directed path from u to v or a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v.

## Strongly connected graph {#strongly-connected-graph}

> [A [Directed graph]({{< relref "directed_graph.md" >}})] is strongly connected, or simply strong, if it contains a directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v.
