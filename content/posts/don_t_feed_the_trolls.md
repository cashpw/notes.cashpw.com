Trolls seek to derail conversations, inject negativity, and generally be a nuisance [for the lulz]({{< relref "for_the_lulz.md" >}}). How do you deal with them? How do you refute their bullshit or drive them out of your communities? Ignore them. Their goal is attention -- don't give it to them. This isn't a foolproof plan. It'll reduce the number of trolls but not all the way to zero.
