> In computer science, an implicit data structure or space-efficient data structure is a [Data structure]({{< relref "data_structures.md" >}}) that stores very little information other than the main or required data: a data structure that requires low overhead. They are called "implicit" because the position of the elements carries meaning and relationship between elements; this is contrasted with the use of pointers to give an explicit relationship between elements. Definitions of "low overhead" vary, but generally means constant overhead; in big O notation, O(1) overhead.
