> In mathematics, [Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}}) is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of [Vertices]({{< relref "vertex.md" >}}) (also called nodes or points) which are connected by [Edges]({{< relref "edge.md" >}}) (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between [Undirected graph]({{< relref "undirected_graph.md" >}}), where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and [Directed graph]({{< relref "directed_graph.md" >}}), where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.
