> In mathematics, topology is concerned with the properties of a geometric [[Geometry]({{< relref "geometry.md" >}})] object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.
