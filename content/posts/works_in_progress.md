A collection of work-in-progress posts. I will eventually extract these into individual nodes.


## Components of Software Project Planning {#components-of-software-project-planning}


### Identify and Explicitly Define the Problem {#identify-and-explicitly-define-the-problem}

-   Perhaps the most important part
-   Define the solution you seek to solve. Your project is a success if it addresses the points you list here.


### Understand the History and Surroundings {#understand-the-history-and-surroundings}

Projects are rarely greenfield. Consider the history of projects which came before and the context in which your project exists.


### Dependencies {#dependencies}

Understand how your work will depend on external services.

-   Do those services have capacity to support your project?
-   What will you do if one of your dependencies fails?


### Technical Debt {#technical-debt}

-   Is there pre-existing technical debt?
-   What, if any, technical debt will this project introduce?
    -   What is your plan, and timeline, for mitigation and/or remediation?


### Estimates {#estimates}

-   Timeline estimate
-   Effort estimate


### Security {#security}


### Reliability {#reliability}


### Data Integrity {#data-integrity}


### Privacy {#privacy}


### Scalability {#scalability}


### Latency {#latency}


### Abuse {#abuse}


### Accessibility {#accessibility}


### Alternative Methods {#alternative-methods}

-   Assume there is more than one way to complete your project. Resist the pull of your first idea. Think critically and document alternative approaches to solving the underlying problem


### Have a Plan for ... {#have-a-plan-for-dot-dot-dot}


#### Launch {#launch}

-   How will you launch your project?


#### Testing {#testing}


#### Documentation {#documentation}

-   How will you document your project? At minimum you should have a document which describes the goals, etc (see below).


## Software Project Planning Principles {#software-project-planning-principles}

1.  It doesn't exist unless you can measure it.
    -   Your feature isn't "live" unless you have a metric/heartbeat/etc which indicates as such.
