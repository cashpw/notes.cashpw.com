The lessons learned in a kind environment are useful for accurate application (predictions, choices, inferences, etc). Also see [Wicked environment]({{< relref "wicked_environment.md" >}}).

> Inference involves two settings: In the first, information is acquired (learning); in the second, it is applied (predictions or choices). Kind learning environments involve close matches between the informational elements in the two settings and are a necessary condition for accurate inferences.
