## Current program {#current-program}

My current program is a [Concurrent training]({{< relref "concurrent_training.md" >}}) consisting of [Progressive overload]({{< relref "progressive_overload.md" >}}) resistance training ([5/3/1]({{< relref "5_3_1.md" >}})), running, and rowing ([Pete Marston | Beginner Training]({{< relref "pete_marston_beginner_training.md" >}})). It's informed by [Keith Baar | Using Molecular Biology to Maximize Concurrent Training]({{< relref "keith_baar_using_molecular_biology_to_maximize_concurrent_training.md" >}}) to minimize cardio's negative effect on strength and hypertrophy. I'm also working through a [Pistol squat progression]({{< relref "pistol_squat_progression.md" >}}).

| Day       | 5am: Cardio | 9am: Strength        |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Monday    | Run         | Shoulders            |
| Tuesday   | Row         | Back                 |
| Wednesday | Run         | Mobility, Grip, Neck |
| Thursday  | Row         | Chest                |
| Friday    | Run         | Legs                 |
| Saturday  | Long run    | Rest                 |
| Sunday    | Rest        | Mobility, Grip, Neck |

My goal is to get to the Intermediate level as described in [ExRx | Weightlifting Performance Standards]({{< relref "exrx_weightlifting_performance_standards.md" >}}).

## When away from a gym {#when-away-from-a-gym}

My resistance training requires a gym with barbells, free weights, etc. I skip that training if I'm away from a gym. I continue my cardio and replace the resistance training a modified version of [r/bodyweightfitness | Recommended Routine]({{< relref "r_bodyweightfitness_recommended_routine.md" >}}).
