## Current program {#current-program}

My current program is a [Concurrent training]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}}) consisting of [Progressive overload]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}}) resistance training ([5/3/1]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}})), running, and rowing ([Pete Marston | Beginner Training]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}})). It's informed by [Keith Baar | Using Molecular Biology to Maximize Concurrent Training]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}}) to minimize cardio's negative effect on strength and hypertrophy.

| Day       | 5am  | 9am            |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Monday    | Run  | Overhead press |
| Tuesday   | Row  | Deadlift       |
| Wednesday | Run  | Mobility       |
| Thursday  | Row  | Chest          |
| Friday    | Run  | Squat          |
| Saturday  | Run  | Mobility       |
| Sunday    | Rest | Rest           |

I'm lifting between the untrained and novice levels as described in [ExRx | Weightlifting Performance Standards]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}}).


## When away from a gym {#when-away-from-a-gym}

My resistance training requires a gym with barbells, free weights, etc. I skip that training if I'm away from a gym. I continue my cardio and replace the resistance training a modified version of [r/bodyweightfitness | Recommended Routine]({{< relref "exercise_program.md" >}}).
