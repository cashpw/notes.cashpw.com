> In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which [Graph]({{< relref "graph.md" >}}) are formed: an undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of [Edges]({{< relref "edge.md" >}}) (unordered pairs of vertices), while a directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of arcs (ordered pairs of vertices).
