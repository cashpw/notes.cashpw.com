> Shuhari is a Japanese martial art concept which describes the stages of learning to mastery. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines, such as Go.
>
> _Shuhari_ roughly translates to "to keep, to fall, to break away" or "follow the rules, break the rules, transcend the rules".
>
> Shuhari can be decomposed in 3 kanjis:
>
> -   _**shu**_ (守) "protect", "obey"---traditional wisdom---learning fundamentals, techniques, heuristics, proverbs.
> -   _**ha**_ (破) "detach", "digress"---breaking with tradition---detachment from the illusions of self, to break with tradition - to find exceptions to traditional wisdom, to find new approaches. In some styles of Japanese music (gagaku and noh), it is also the middle of the song.
> -   _**ri**_ (離) "leave", "separate"---transcendence---there are no techniques or proverbs, all moves are natural, becoming one with spirit alone without clinging to forms; transcending the physical - there is no traditional technique or wisdom, all movements are allowed.
