> In graph theory [[Graph theory]({{< relref "graph_theory.md" >}})] and combinatorial optimization, a closure of a directed graph [[Directed graph]({{< relref "directed_graph.md" >}})] is a set of vertices [[Vertices]({{< relref "vertex.md" >}})] C, such that no edges [[Edge]({{< relref "edge.md" >}})] leave C.
