> Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique [[Pedagogy]({{< relref "pedagogy.md" >}})] that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect [[Spacing effect]({{< relref "spacing_effect.md" >}})]. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.

> The basis for spaced repetition research was laid by Hermann Ebbinghaus, who suggested that information loss over time follows a forgetting curve [[Forgetting curve]({{< relref "forgetting_curve.md" >}})], but that forgetting could be reset with repetition based on active recall.

## Tools {#tools}

My preferred solution is [org-fc]({{< relref "org_flashcards.md" >}}). However, [Anki]({{< relref "AnkiPowerfulIntelligentFlashcards.md" >}}) is, as far as I can tell, the most popular and well known. I used Anki exclusively prior to switching to org-fc.

#### Back {#back}

An evidence-based learning technique, usually performed with flashcards, which exploits the [Spacing effect]({{< relref "spacing_effect.md" >}}) and [Testing effect]({{< relref "testing_effect.md" >}}). New and difficult cards are shown more often while older and less difficult cards are shown less frequently.
