> A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning [[Machine learning]({{< relref "machine_learning.md" >}})] frameworks and a prominent framework for approaching generative AI. The concept was initially developed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014. In a GAN, two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game [[Zero-sum game]({{< relref "zero_sum_game.md" >}})], where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.

>
> GANs are similar to mimicry in evolutionary biology, with an evolutionary arms race between both networks.
