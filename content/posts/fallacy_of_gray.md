The fallacy of gray is an assertion, in the face of a lack of a clear black and white divide, that the cases are all equally good or bad. The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different _shade_ of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

> The Sophisticate: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It's all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else."
>
> The Zetet: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view"
