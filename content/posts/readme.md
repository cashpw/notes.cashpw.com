The purpose of this `README` is to explain some of the details in this collection of content. In no particular order:

-   I haven't "written" all of the posts. I employ liberal use of quoting as a way of [archiving]({{<relref "a.md#" >}}).
-   I use tags prefixed with `@` to identify original authors (eg: [@cashweaver](/tags/cashweaver)).
-   When PostA links to PostB, then a backlink to PostA will appear at the bottom of PostB ([example]({{<relref "a.md#" >}})).
-   I often omit the source of a quote if there is only once source used in the entire post. You'll find that source mentioned just below the title after "References".
