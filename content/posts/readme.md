The purpose of this `README` is to explain some of the details in this collection of content. In no particular order:

-   There is a [style guide]({{< relref "style_guide.md" >}})
-   I haven't "written" all of the posts. I employ liberal use of quoting as a way of [archiving]({{< relref "a.md" >}}).
-   When PostA links to PostB, then a backlink to PostA will appear at the bottom of PostB ([example]({{< relref "a.md" >}})).
