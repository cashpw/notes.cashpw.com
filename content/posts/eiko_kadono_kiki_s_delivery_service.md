Kiki's Delivery Service was inspired by one of my daughter's drawings. It was a picture of a witch flying through the sky, listening to a radio.

I knew I would fly as an author, because writing fiction made me feel as though I had wings. I chose to make the protagonist witch a twelve-year-old, just like my daughter at the time. That's how Kiki's Delivery Service got its start.

I decided one thing right from the beginning: Kiki's sole power would be flying through the sky on her broom. With only one type of magic, Kiki would need to use her brain to solve problems. Overcoming conflicts would help her grow, add some ups and downs to the story, and make her journey more interesting. Kiki's magic is as close to normal as possible—it's everyday magic. She is a witch, but she's also a perfectly ordinary girl. She has the same worries, disappointments, and joys as anyone else, so I knew readers around her age would relate to her. And as I continued writing Kiki's story, I realized that even if you can't fly through the air like Kiki, you have your own unique power that is equally important. As I wrote and revised, wrote and revised, I discovered that I loved writing. As long as I created stories, I could live an exciting life with new discoveries every day. And I decided that, if nothing else, I would continue writing as long as I live. I'll never forget the peace of mind I felt at that moment—I sensed the magic inside myself. I've come to believe that everyone has some type of magic inside them. If a person can find their magic and lovingly cultivate it, they'll truly feel alive every day.

In this house lived a family of witches. Well, Kokiri, the mother, came from a long line of witches, and Okino, the father, was human. As a folklorist, he studied legends and tales about spirits and magic. Kiki was their only child, soon to turn thirteen.

The three were talking over tea about Kiki's coming-of-age day. When daughters of witches and humans reached the age of ten, they decided whether to follow tradition and live as witches themselves. If a girl picked this path, she promptly learned her mother's magic and chose a full-moon night of her thirteenth year as her coming-of-age day. For a young witch, this meant leaving her parents' house and moving to live on her own in a town or village in need of magic. Of course, finding a witchless town on her own is a difficult thing for a little girl to do. But over the years, witches' powers had grown weaker and their numbers had dropped. Such important tradition helped them survive, as well as share the existence of witches with as many towns, villages, and people as possible. At age ten, Kiki had decided to become a witch and learn Kokiri's magic right away. Kokiri had two magic abilities. The first was growing herbs to make sneeze medicine, and the second was flying through the sky on a broom.

Kiki quickly got the hang of flying. But as she grew older, she often found herself distracted by all sorts of things—for example, the big pimples that started appearing on the sides of her nose, or deciding which dress she should wear to her friend's birthday party. Whenever that happened, her broom would suddenly start to fall.

Soon after, Kokiri tied bells to the tall trees of the forest. If Kiki was lost in thought and flying too low, her feet would ring the bells and the sound would bring her back to reality.

Meanwhile there was the sneeze-medicine-making, but Kiki didn't seem to be cut out for it. She was impatient and found it difficult to grow the herbs, finely chop the leaves and roots, and slowly simmer them.

Meanwhile there was the sneeze-medicine-making, but Kiki didn't seem to be cut out for it. She was impatient and found it difficult to grow the herbs, finely chop the leaves and roots, and slowly simmer them. "Will another type of magic disappear?" Kokiri lamented. In the olden days, witches could use all sorts of magic. But over the years, one type after another disappeared, until even a genuine witch like Kokiri was left with only two abilities. Now her daughter hated one of them, so it was no wonder she was upset.

Witches have long been accompanied by black cats. One could say that's another type of magic, too. When a witch has a baby girl, she searches for a black cat born around the same time and raises them together. As they grow, the cat and the girl learn to speak to each other in their own language. Kokiri used to have a cat named Mémé, and Kiki had one as well—a little black cat named Jiji. By the time the girl came of age, the cat would be a precious companion, and someone to turn to during good times and bad. Eventually the girl would grow up and find a new companion to take the place of her cat. The cat would also find its own partner and from then on, the pair would live separately.

Kiki had a vague sense that Kokiri wanted her to follow in her footsteps, but she didn't wish to become a witch simply because of her mother. I'm going to be whatever I want, Kiki thought. I'm going to decide for myself. One day, Kokiri fashioned her daughter a little broom and asked, "Want to try flying?" "Me? I can fly?" "You're the daughter of a witch, so I should think so." She could tell her mother was trying to lure her into taking up the family tradition, but it was a rare chance, so she agreed to learn the basics. Following Kokiri, she shyly mounted her broom and kicked off the ground. Instantly, her body grew light—she was floating! "I'm flying!" she shouted in spite of herself. She was only about ten feet above the rooftop, but it felt incredible. The sky even seemed a little bluer. And on top of that, a curiosity welled up inside her, lifting both her heart and body. I want to go higher—higher and higher. I wonder what I'll be able to see. What's it like up there? I need to know more. It was love at first flight. So of course she decided to become a witch. "It's in your blood," Kokiri said with delight, but Kiki told herself, No, it's not just that. I decided for myself.

A long, thin broom hung from the eaves of the shed. It gleamed in the westering sun. "If it's this beautiful, I think it'll be okay," she squealed. "Yeah, it seems like the drying process went well this time." Jiji looked up at her, wide-eyed. "Hey, Kiki, why don't you try flying? The weather's nice." "I can't do that." Kiki shook her head. "I'm not using it until the day I leave. It'll be here soon. I want everything to be brand-new—my clothes, my shoes, and my broom, too. I want to be reborn. I'm sure Mom'll say, 'You're from a long line of witches, so you need to value the old.' But I'm me. I'm a new witch."

"These days, witches don't have to wear a pointy hat and a long cape, but the color of our clothes has always been the blackest black. That can't be changed." That made Kiki sulk even more. "It's so old-fashioned. A black witch with a black cat—black, black, black." "Well, of course it's old-fashioned. We come from old witch blood. Besides, black never goes out of style. Leave it to me. I'll make one in a hurry."

"Mom, can you make the skirt just a little shorter?" Kiki asked, hiking it up and standing on her tiptoes. "Why? It looks good on you." "I think it would be cuter if you could actually see my feet." "This way is much more graceful. It's better to look mild-mannered. Of course, some people complain about witches no matter what you do.

Now then, here's your lunch." Kokiri patted Kiki's shoulder and set a little bundle down next to her. "I used herbs so it won't go bad as fast. Don't eat it all in one place. I remember my mom did a great job making my coming-of-age lunch. She cast some spell on the herbs in the bread that kept it from going bad or even stale. It's a shame we don't know how to do that anymore." "That seems like the sort of thing that would be easy to pass on, though," Okino chimed in, coming in from his study with a book in his hand. "I wonder why it disappeared. Maybe that's just the nature of magic?" "It's strange that I'm a witch and even I don't know. Some say it's because there's no such thing as a completely dark night or perfect silence anymore—if there's a light on or if there's even a tiny noise, we get distracted and can't get our magic to work." "Certainly compared to ancient times, it's gotten a lot brighter," Okino said. "Nowadays there's always a light on somewhere." "Yes, the world sure has changed." Kokiri nodded, but Kiki, looking in the mirror, had a different idea. "Hmm, you think that's why?" Kiki turned around with a dissatisfied frown. "I don't think it's the world's fault that magic has disappeared. Maybe people hold themselves back too much. Mom, aren't you always saying that witches must be quiet and modest? I hate the idea of living my life constantly worrying about what people will say—I'm going to do whatever I want!" "Oh! That's quite a declaration." Okino's eyes widened dramatically. "Listen, Kiki," Kokiri said. "In the past, it wasn't just us witches—all sorts of people had mysterious powers. But most regular people connected these gifts to bad things in their heads. They believed our powers would bring terrible luck." "That could be true." Okino nodded thoughtfully. "It was! You always heard about how witches made mold grow in fresh milk, but that was simply a way to make a special kind of cheese. And now look, today everyone eats that same cheese." As she spoke, Kokiri looked at Kiki with concern. "Witches were able to survive in that sort of world because we forged a give-and-take relationship with everyone else. Sometimes we hold back, but we also help each other out however we can. I think it was a good thing. Because of this, there are even people like your dad who research witches and fairies to gain a better understanding of us." "Was that a compliment? What an honor." Okino jokily bowed.

"I know, Mom. I'll be fine. Don't worry." Kiki nodded repeatedly, then turned to Okino. "Hey, Dad, do you remember when you used to hold me up high? You would put your hands under my arms and lift me up and down. Could you do it one more time?" She looked down quickly, a little embarrassed. "Sure!" Okino replied with extra pep. He put his hands under her arms and tried to lift her. "Phew! You're heavy. When did you get so big? Let me try one more time." He staggered a bit but managed to raise her. "I—I'm up! But—ha-ha-ha—it tickles!" Kiki squirmed and laughed.

Once the broom was hovering, she turned around. "Take care, Mom," she said to Kokiri from a few feet above. If she flew any closer, she knew they would both end up crying.

After one final "Goodbye!" she rocketed into the air. Gradually, everyone's waving hands below grew harder to see, and all the lights of the town twinkled like a starry night turned upside down. The full moon hung in the sky, watching over Kiki. Eventually even the lights of the town faded, and all she could see below were mountains shaped like the dark backs of animals.

"You seem awfully excited," Jiji said. "But there could be a witch already living here, like that other town before." "Well, we won't know until we land and ask." Kiki sharply angled her broomstick down and landed lightly on one of the town's roads. On the ground, the streets were bustling with afternoon shoppers. When Kiki jumped onto the cobblestones with a thud, everyone was startled. Some people seemed scared and fled, while others hid behind someone else. Soon Kiki was surrounded by a wall of people. She hurriedly took the broom out from between her legs, placed Jiji on her shoulder, and put on a cheerful smile. "Um, I'm Kiki, and I'm a witch—" "Oho, a witch, huh?" one older woman said. "You're a rare breed these days." The woman adjusted the glasses on her nose and stared. "So there's no witch in this town? Phew! Well, as I was saying, I'm Kiki the witch, and this is my black cat, Jiji. I'll make myself at home," she said as she looked around at everyone and then curtsied more carefully than usual. "Make yourself at home? You mean here, in the town of Koriko?" a man chimed in. "Who made that decision?" a woman exclaimed. "Was it that new mayor?" At this point, everyone was exchanging glances with the people next to them and chatting among themselves. "Is there anything good about having a witch around?" "Isn't it kind of strange to go flying about the sky in this day and age?" "They say there used to be one here long ago, but we've been fine without one all this time." "Mommy, witches use magic, right? Seems cool!" "They do outrageous things! You'll get scared!" "Do you have some wicked plot?" As Kiki listened to all the comments, which couldn't really be called kind, her chest tightened. Even so, she tried to be confident. Smile, smile, she thought. She needed to come up with a reply. "I'd love to live in this town. It's pretty, and I like the clock tower," Kiki complimented them. "Well, it's great that you've taken a liking to the town, but…" "But we don't want any trouble." "Whatever floats your boat." Once everyone was satisfied, having had their say, they scattered every which way and disappeared back into the town.

The people from Kiki's hometown were happy to live near a witch. They valued her family, and even said kind things like Witches are like oil for your gears and Having a witch around brings life to the town. Every day someone was stopping by offering something tasty, saying, I just had a little extra! And naturally, Kiki and her family gave back. They shared Kokiri's sneeze medicine, taught the townspeople the names of traditional herbs, played cat's cradle with elderly folks who lived alone, delivered lost and forgotten items by broom—it was a give-and-take lifestyle, just as Kokiri said. That was how it had been ever since Kiki was born, so this whatever floats your boat attitude was strange. After all, Kiki was new to town and she had just come of age—how was she supposed to "float her boat"?

The flour house, which was right next to the bakery, really was a flour storehouse, and it seemed completely coated in the white powder. After Kiki and Jiji relaxed and ate some of their food, they crawled into bed, exhausted. "I might be a white cat by tomorrow." Jiji looked himself over and sneezed.

There might be another person who does, too, don't you think?" "Well, yeah. There might even be three." As quickly as Jiji answered, he was soon snoring the even breaths of sleep.

"I'm too shy for that." The girl slowly batted her eyelashes again. It was as if she thought being shy was a good thing. Intimidated, Kiki suddenly felt her chest grow tight—she couldn't pinpoint it, but somehow this girl felt much more grown-up than her. "Shy? That's weird," Kiki said. "Oh, you don't understand how that feels yet?" The girl smiled faintly, as if pitying Kiki.

Seeing how happy she was, all of Kiki's tension melted away as if it had never existed. Feeling lighter, she braced herself and said, "To tell the truth…" And at the same time, the girl said, "I have a confession to make…." "Huh?" They looked at each other. "You go first, Miss Witch," the girl said. "I did something horrible." Kiki looked down and told the girl how she'd read the letter, how it blew away, and how she wrote the poem on a leaf and delivered it to Ai. "Wow," the girl said, a bit disappointed. "I'm sorry. But I think I remembered the poem right. When you came into the shop, you seemed to know everything. I really wanted to know what kind of poem you would write—so I couldn't help myself. I hope you can forgive me?" "What, you thought that about me? I felt the same way about you," the girl said. "I didn't really think Ai would come looking for me. If I told him my name, I thought he wouldn't even care. But when I came here, you were so confident and seemed so much smarter than me, even though we're the same age. So I was determined to prove myself. I'm sorry. I think we have more in common than I first thought, Miss Witch. I bet we would get along." The girl smiled, batting her eyelashes as before. Kiki smiled back at her and said in mock seriousness, "I may be a witch, but you can call me Kiki." The girl giggled, then dropped her voice to mimic Kiki and said, "I'm a normal girl, but I suppose my name is no longer a secret—you can call me Mimi."
