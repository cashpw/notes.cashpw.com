## Summary {#summary}


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

I find myself drawn to articles and conversations about the [meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming) of work. I think I've hit a saturation point with these sorts of things. To put it to words, I think there's a part of me that hopes that the difficulty I find in work isn't intrinsic to the work but rather the result of some aspect of the process by which I do the work. That is, work could be free of difficulty if I were to change my process or adopt a new one entirely. I'm no longer convinced that a thing exists.
