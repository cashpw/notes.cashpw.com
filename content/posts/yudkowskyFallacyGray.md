[Fallacy of gray]({{< relref "fallacy_of_gray.md" >}})


## Notes {#notes}

> The Sophisticate: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It's all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else."
>
> The Zetet: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view"
>
> —Marc Stiegler, David's Sling
