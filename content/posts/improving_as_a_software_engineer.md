## Incomplete ideas {#incomplete-ideas}

-   There are more than one axis to improve along.
-   Splitting time between executing and thinking/learning/reading/etc.
    -   You do learn through execution, but you'll only learn what you're executing on. The space of things you could be improving on is wider than what you're already doing (by definition).
    -   Set aside time to think and learn -- don't fill all your time with heads-down execution time
        -   1:1 split? Sounds extereme (How will I get anything done?) but encourages you to really focus during execution time and forces you to think/learn/read/etc.
