The flywheel effect is the idea that the amount of reward received for one unit of effort increases as you continue to put effort into the system. Indeed, at some point the momentum might be such that you can stop putting in effort and yet continue to collect reward.

> The Flywheel effect is [the idea that] [n]o matter how dramatic the end result, good-to-great transformations never happen in one fell swoop. [...] there is no single defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.
