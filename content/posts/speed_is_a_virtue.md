Going faster allows you to do more, yes, or even to do the same amount in less time. More importantly, going faster:

-   makes actions feel more possible and approachable because they're smaller (e.g. A letter that takes you two minutes to write is more approachable than a letter that takes you two weeks to write.)
-   enables "just try it" interactions
-   reduces the round trip time of everything interaction and every interaction you have
-   changes, in a positive way, the feeling others have when interacting with you; it's fun to interact with someone who's responsive
