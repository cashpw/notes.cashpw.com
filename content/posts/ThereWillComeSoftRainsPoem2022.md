<div class="verse">

(War Time)<br />
<br />
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,<br />
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br />
<br />
And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br />
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;<br />
<br />
Robins will wear their feathery fire<br />
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br />
<br />
And not one will know of the war, not one<br />
Will care at last when it is done.<br />
<br />
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree<br />
If mankind perished utterly;<br />
<br />
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,<br />
Would scarcely know that we were gone.<br />
