> In [Game theory]({{< relref "game_theory.md" >}}), a [Cooperative game]({{< relref "cooperative_game.md" >}}) (or coalitional game) is a game with competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). Those are opposed to [Non-cooperative game]({{< relref "non_cooperative_game.md" >}}) in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).
