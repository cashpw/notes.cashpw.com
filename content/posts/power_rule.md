> In calculus [[Calculus]({{< relref "calculus.md" >}})], the power rule is used to differentiate [[Differentiate]({{< relref "differential_calculus.md" >}})] functions of the form \\(f(x) = x^r\\), whenever \\(r\\) is a real number. Since differentiation is a linear operation on the space of differentiable functions, polynomials can also be differentiated using this rule. The power rule underlies the Taylor series as it relates a power series with a function's derivatives.
