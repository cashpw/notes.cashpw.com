Summary Set your editor&amp;rsquo;s column width very low &amp;hellip; 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].
Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.
Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve seem content width discussed often when it comes to reading. A width of 72 characters comes to mind, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I picked that up.</description></item><item><title>Tim Peck</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tim_peck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:09:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tim_peck/</guid><description>Among other things:

TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin :: To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)

Summary Thoughts Notes Narrative Narrative books are books that tell a story. Examples include biographies, memoirs, and histories.
Tree Tree books are books that lay out a framework of ideas. A good example is Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking: Fast and Slow, which lays out his life&amp;rsquo;s work — the entirety of behavioural economics — in a single book.

TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don’t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

Summary Thoughts Notes If I say, “write down ten ideas for books you can write” I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. “Hmmm,” you think, “what else can I come up with?”

Summary A well written essay whose thesis, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to say, eludes me.
Thoughts I expect one could find gold in this essay but I think I will instead read, as one commenter recommended, &amp;ldquo;Goliath&amp;rdquo; by Matt Stoller.

Summary Thoughts TODO Notes One of the most important rationalist skills is “noticing your confusion”. But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don’t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia :: SMART Criteria</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smartcriteria2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smartcriteria2022/</guid><description>(“SMART Criteria” 2022)

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”. He’s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander :: For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexanderthenhighsaturatedfatdiets2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexanderthenhighsaturatedfatdiets2020/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the ‘recognition-primed decision making’ model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia :: Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/festinalente2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/festinalente2022/</guid><description>(“Festina Lente” 2022)

A desirable difficulty is a learning task that requires a considerable but desirable amount of effort, thereby improving long-term performance.
Examples include:
Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards) Spacing and interleaving (eg: Spaced Repetition) To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval. The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing during practice.</description></item><item><title>Dan Moore</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/dan_moore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/dan_moore/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dan Moore :: Cultivate the Skill of Undivided Attention, or "Deep Work"</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mooredscultivateskillundividedattentiondeepwork2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mooredscultivateskillundividedattentiondeepwork2019/</guid><description>Dan Moore, (mooreds 2019)

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.</description></item><item><title>James Stuber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james_stuber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james_stuber/</guid><description/></item><item><title>James Stuber :: Master Boring Fundamentals 01: Boring Is Fun</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/masterboringfundamentals01boringfun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:51:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/masterboringfundamentals01boringfun/</guid><description>James Stuber, (NO_ITEM_DATA:MasterBoringFundamentals01BoringFun)
Summary Thoughts Notes We go to incredible lengths to avoid actions that we know are good for us.
Ski enthusiast Tim Peck shows us that there are actually two types of fun:

Summary The legend of John Gottman&amp;rsquo;s marriage counselling success isn&amp;rsquo;t supported by the underlying research at a statistical level; however, the techniques he advocates may help anyway.
Thoughts I enjoyed the personality that this essay had. A more direct essay could have started out by stating the problems with Gottman&amp;rsquo;s research.

Summary Thoughts Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important.</description></item><item><title>Clary Illian</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary_illian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary_illian/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Clary Illian :: A Potter's Workbook.</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/illianpotterworkbook2012/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/illianpotterworkbook2012/</guid><description>Clary Illian, (Illian 2012)

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart

Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains’ ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we’ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/askhnwhatwasbestdecisionyoumadeyourcareerhackernews/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/askhnwhatwasbestdecisionyoumadeyourcareerhackernews/</guid><description>Source: (“Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News” n.d.)

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.

Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information.

BUT there is a place for &amp;lsquo;form-finding&amp;rsquo; which I think describes how you made these shapes you are showing us.</description></item><item><title>Polyphasic Sleep: 40 Day Trial Results</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/polyphasic_sleep_40_day_trial_results/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 12:15:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/polyphasic_sleep_40_day_trial_results/</guid><description>What would you do with another few hours every day? This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.
Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.
Why Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.
I expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment.</description></item><item><title>The First Lesson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</guid><description> Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action &amp;mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, &amp;quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?&amp;quot;

I&amp;rsquo;ll write a follow-up, or amend this post, with the relevant source code at some point.
I started tracking my time a few months ago so I could have data to back up questions about how much I time I was giving to studying, working, cooking, chores, friends, etc. The solutions I found for tracking personal time didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the way I wanted to track time:</description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</guid><description>The unexamined life is not worth living, man.

Anki is flashcard software that integrates spaced repetition and active recall testing. I found creating cards, as well as managing existing cards, was easier after creating custom note types to represent specific information.
Most of my cards include a common field: Source. I like to keep track of where I found the information that went into the card, be that Wikipedia or a textbook or otherwise.</description></item><item><title>Unread</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/unread/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/unread/</guid><description>Please sort in order of oldest to youngest.
