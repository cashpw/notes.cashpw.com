In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the ‘recognition-primed decision making’ model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Sama Vritti Pranayama</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/sama_vritti_pranayama/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 10:32:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/sama_vritti_pranayama/</guid><description>A four-part breathing technique:

For example, knowing that London is in the United Kingdom is a piece of explicit knowledge; it can be written down, transmitted, and understood by a recipient.</description></item><item><title>Blogroll</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/blogroll/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 11:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/blogroll/</guid><description>A list of blogs I&amp;rsquo;ve found informative/useful/fun in no particular order:

First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is a desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them. The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.</description></item><item><title>Spaced Repetition</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spaced_repetition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spaced_repetition/</guid><description> Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.</description></item><item><title>Spacing Effect</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spacing_effect/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spacing_effect/</guid><description> The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out.</description></item><item><title>Desirable Difficulty</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/desirable_difficulty/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/desirable_difficulty/</guid><description>A desirable difficulty is a learning task that requires a considerable but desirable amount of effort, thereby improving long-term performance.
Examples include:
Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards) Spacing and interleaving (eg: Spaced Repetition) To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval. The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing during practice.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: How do you learn complex, dense technical information?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ask_hn_how_do_you_learn_complex_dense_technical_information/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 12:41:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ask_hn_how_do_you_learn_complex_dense_technical_information/</guid><description>Notes Essentially I think learning is fundamentally Pain.

Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called &amp;ldquo;desirable difficulty&amp;rdquo;.

Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read.</description></item><item><title>Noticing the Taste of Lotus</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/noticing_the_taste_of_lotus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/noticing_the_taste_of_lotus/</guid><description>Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”.

You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Theory of Change</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/theory_of_change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:28:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/theory_of_change/</guid><description>I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it.

There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.
Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.
Why Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.
I expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment.</description></item><item><title>The First Lesson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</guid><description>Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action &amp;mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, &amp;quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?&amp;quot;

I&amp;rsquo;ll write a follow-up, or amend this post, with the relevant source code at some point.
I started tracking my time a few months ago so I could have data to back up questions about how much I time I was giving to studying, working, cooking, chores, friends, etc. The solutions I found for tracking personal time didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the way I wanted to track time:</description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</guid><description>The unexamined life is not worth living, man.

Anki is flashcard software that integrates spaced repetition and active recall testing. I found creating cards, as well as managing existing cards, was easier after creating custom note types to represent specific information.
Most of my cards include a common field: Source. I like to keep track of where I found the information that went into the card, be that Wikipedia or a textbook or otherwise.</description></item><item><title>kjq</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smallest_word/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smallest_word/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Unread</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/unread/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/unread/</guid><description>Please sort in order of oldest to youngest.
