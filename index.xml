It is piss easy (and also hilarious) to upset conservatives, why only go after the SJWs? The easy answer is, well, if you upset a feminist, you might make her cry; if you upset a Nazi, he might stab you, and that has a cooling effect. But the more obvious answer is that they actually agree with the racist, MRA, and TERF talking points they repeat, but would rather not think about it.</description></item><item><title>Creamy vegan mushroom lasagna</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/0905eaa4-16e9-4abb-b78c-0b00f855e60d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 08:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/0905eaa4-16e9-4abb-b78c-0b00f855e60d/</guid><description>This recipe is from (Murnane 2017) and (Murnane n.d.).

Visualize your creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater. This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives.
Because your pipe has only one faucet, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortcut to achieving clarity other than first emptying the wastewater.</description></item><item><title>Tweet test</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/353501e4-2df1-477c-bcce-a3e2891fe4eb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 09:08:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/353501e4-2df1-477c-bcce-a3e2891fe4eb/</guid><description>After writing a post, I try compressing it into a single tweet [(e.g. 140-280 characters)].

Network effects are typically positive, resulting in a given user deriving more value from a product as more users join the same network. The adoption of a product by an additional user can be broken into two effects: an increase in the value to all other users ( &amp;ldquo;total effect&amp;rdquo;) and also the enhancement of other non-users' motivation for using the product (&amp;ldquo;marginal effect&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>Adversarial interoperability</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/b043e085-a9d3-4da5-8686-938fb3bfdcda/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 10:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/b043e085-a9d3-4da5-8686-938fb3bfdcda/</guid><description>A type of Interoperability.
[Adversarial interoperability is] when you create a new product or service that plugs into the existing ones without the permission of the companies that make them.

Summary White people &amp;ndash; both those who profess to be non-racist and otherwise &amp;ndash; tend to view racism as &amp;ldquo;tolerable&amp;rdquo; or else &amp;ldquo;easy to disregard&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to sacrifice minorities in order to win.

Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, the random motion of particles in the air, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.

These keys are most often strings, with links between [Vertices] defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed Depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.</description></item><item><title>Leto Atreides</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/15d4a8f5-48d0-416c-acae-f6f87d2fd145/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 10:23:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/15d4a8f5-48d0-416c-acae-f6f87d2fd145/</guid><description>Among other things:

In particular, the Euclidean distance of a vector from the origin is a norm, called the Euclidean norm, or 2-norm, which may also be defined as the square root of the inner product of a vector with itself.</description></item><item><title>Transpose</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/df465332-f865-424c-9028-1776dddd1a58/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 05:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/df465332-f865-424c-9028-1776dddd1a58/</guid><description>In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix \(A\) by producing another matrix, often denoted by \(A^{\textsf{T}}\) (among other notations).

A tree rotation moves one [Vertex] up in the tree and one [Vertex] down. It is used to change the shape of the tree, and in particular to decrease its height by moving smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up, resulting in improved performance of many tree operations.</description></item><item><title>Determinant</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/dd4f5aad-c5ac-4cc3-a1c4-38607969f3c2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 07:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/dd4f5aad-c5ac-4cc3-a1c4-38607969f3c2/</guid><description>In mathematics, the determinant is a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a Square matrix.

ROAM_REFS: [cite:@RedblackTree2022] In computer science, a red–black tree is a kind of Self-balancing binary search tree. Each Vertex stores an extra bit representing &amp;ldquo;color&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;), used to ensure that the Tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged [Tree rotation] and &amp;ldquo;repainted&amp;rdquo; to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.</description></item><item><title>Height-balanced binary tree</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/86c3b62f-4766-4c76-856b-bebe9fe6d125/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 16:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/86c3b62f-4766-4c76-856b-bebe9fe6d125/</guid><description> For height-balanced Binary trees, the height is defined to be logarithmic \(O(\log n)\) in the number \(n\) of items.

Notes Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s Diplomacy is a masterful, brilliant and provocative account of world politics and American foreign policy from Cardinal Richelieu to the end of the Cold War. Its title, however is somewhat deceptive, because it is more than just an analysis of the tactics and techniques practiced in the conduct of international diplomacy. Diplomacy is old-fashioned diplomatic history which concentrates on the grand strategy, leadership, and philosophy of the great power relationships.</description></item><item><title>Non-zero-sum game</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/9f52c68a-3302-47bc-a4a4-3a4ff20d41be/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 10:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/9f52c68a-3302-47bc-a4a4-3a4ff20d41be/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] non-zero-sum describes a situation [(Game theory)] in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero.

In other words, player one&amp;rsquo;s gain is equivalent to player two&amp;rsquo;s loss, therefore the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero.

Summary A discussion of Fully Automated Luxury Communism.
Notes [Della Z Duncan]
And so what about this term, fully automated luxury communism? How might you introduce that to someone who&amp;rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?
[Eric Wycoff Rogers]
Yeah, I would say essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization &amp;ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible &amp;ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what&amp;rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.</description></item><item><title>Robert Frost</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/93bad6b6-218f-4e56-8d63-ed1cb50f66f0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/93bad6b6-218f-4e56-8d63-ed1cb50f66f0/</guid><description>Among other things:

Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined questioning that can be used to pursue thought in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the truth of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out logical consequences of thought or to control discussions.</description></item><item><title>Gadfly</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ef091c65-8db5-40c8-b577-e34b3070143d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 18:41:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ef091c65-8db5-40c8-b577-e34b3070143d/</guid><description> A gadfly is a person who interferes with the status quo of a society or community by posing novel, potentially upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities. The term is originally associated with the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates in his defense when on trial for his life.

In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.
[&amp;hellip;]
To improve performance, priority queues are typically based on a heap [Heap], giving O(log n) performance for inserts and removals, and O(n) to build the heap initially from a set of n elements.</description></item><item><title>Queue</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/f7ca3e99-0356-4651-996e-542a11d67f50/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/f7ca3e99-0356-4651-996e-542a11d67f50/</guid><description>A queue is an Abstract data type.
In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue.</description></item><item><title>Balanced binary tree</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/14876c69-a161-4b59-976a-d659cfe9435c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:26:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/14876c69-a161-4b59-976a-d659cfe9435c/</guid><description> A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype).</description></item><item><title>Anxious attachment</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/anxious_attachment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 13:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/anxious_attachment/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anxious-ambivalent attachment</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/59ed8490-de7b-4a4e-a5d0-026ea3990d34/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/59ed8490-de7b-4a4e-a5d0-026ea3990d34/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child over-indexes on seeking comfort from their guardians and avoids risk.
In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns.</description></item><item><title>Secure attachment</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4873ac61-c885-41f7-bbba-9269bc91b0a9/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4873ac61-c885-41f7-bbba-9269bc91b0a9/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child ventures out into the world, encounters a Strange Situation, and returns to the guardian for comfort.

The conservative mindset tends to sort things into binaries with no room for scale.</description></item><item><title> Authoritarian followers place "being normal" substantially higher than most people do</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/5d8f2b24-1889-45ee-8613-07f7bc0f2db2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 09:19:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/5d8f2b24-1889-45ee-8613-07f7bc0f2db2/</guid><description>The low [Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)] say they&amp;rsquo;d like to be low RWAs.

[&amp;hellip;]
To the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right. Historically, the first sign that things are about to get a lot worse for minorities is when the racism stops being euphemistic.</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | The Ship of Theseus</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/309082e8-abb5-4fdf-9944-fc63d8a8197e/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/309082e8-abb5-4fdf-9944-fc63d8a8197e/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2018)

Summary Broadly, controlling the conversation is about making people talk about what you want them to talk about. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.

This will initiate the release of free radicals and polymerization. The more drying the oil, the harder the polymer. So start with the right oil.
(Canter n.d.)
Strip your pan down to the iron Heat the pan to 200°F (94°C) to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s dry Pour a little flaxseed oil on the skillet and rub the oil all over with your hands Wipe the skillet with a paper/cloth towel unitl it looks like there isn&amp;rsquo;t any oil left (there is, just not a visible amount) Place the skillet in the oven Set the oven to bake at 500°F (260°C) Leave the skillet in the oven for 1 hour after it reaches 500°F (260°C) Turn the oven off Leave the skillet in the oven for 2 hours and keep the door closed Repeat 5 times so the skillet has a total of 6 coats If you try this, you will be tempted to use a thicker coat of oil to speed up the process.</description></item><item><title>Matt Eding | Sparse Matrices</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/26116df3-08f6-4a3d-ab21-c1f33d2facfd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 18:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/26116df3-08f6-4a3d-ab21-c1f33d2facfd/</guid><description>TODO_AUTHOR, (Eding n.d.)

Once upon a time, the planet was tyrannised by a giant dragon. The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived.</description></item><item><title>James F.

Thoughts This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen these concepts (e.g. Deep work and Contiguous Time Blocks / Single-Task Important Items; Agile and Feedback Loop) which gives me greater confidence in their profundity. It may be trite to say you should Just Start or to Drop Unimportant Tasks; however, these simple truths are still true and I often forget them.

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

With a growth mindset, individuals tend to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of adversity, accept and learn from failure, and focus on the process rather than the outcome. They see talents and abilities as skills that are developed through effort.

A graph in this context is made up of Vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by Edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between Undirected graph, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and Directed graph, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.

the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and the function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

Summary Programs, obviously, hold all of these properties. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:
You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune You are a maker. You build things for people to use We self-select into communities of our peers based on these ideals.</description></item><item><title>Footnote to Howl</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/99b2e935-acef-4ef6-9904-fbac7797c17b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:54:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/99b2e935-acef-4ef6-9904-fbac7797c17b/</guid><description>Holy!

See Em.
I am a contract-drafting em,
The loyalest of lawyers!
I draw up terms for deals &amp;lsquo;twixt firms
To service my employers!
But in between these lines I write
Of the accounts receivable,
I&amp;rsquo;m stuck by an uncanny fright;
The world seems unbelievable!
How did it all come to be,
That there should be such ems as me?
Whence these deals and whence these firms</description></item><item><title>Tragedy of the commons</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/d6d36741-18ca-48fe-bb2e-85bc849ddd93/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/d6d36741-18ca-48fe-bb2e-85bc849ddd93/</guid><description>[&amp;hellip;] a situation in which individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action.

Notes Advice Reverse You need to stop being so hard on yourself, remember you are your own worst critic Stop making excuses for yourself, you will never be able to change until you admit you&amp;rsquo;ve hit bottom You need to remember that the government can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are counterproductive You need to remember that the free market can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are necessary You need to pay more attention to your diet or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up very unhealthy You need to pay less attention to your weight or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in a spiral of shame and self-loathing and at risk of eating disorders You need to be more conscious of how your actions in social situations can make other people uncomfortable and violate their boundaries You need to overcome your social phobia by realizing that most interactions go well and that probably talking to people won&amp;rsquo;t always make them hate you and cause you to be ostracized forever You need to be less selfish and more considerate of the needs of others You can&amp;rsquo;t live for others all the time, you need to remember you deserve to be happy as well Follow your dreams, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be working forever at a job you hate Your dream of becoming a professional cosplayer may not be the best way to ensure a secure future for your family, go into petroleum engineering instead It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them.</description></item><item><title>Echo Chamber</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/3657474e-5e72-4f19-8664-c66583f6310d/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 07:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/3657474e-5e72-4f19-8664-c66583f6310d/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal.

If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;.

Summary A list of what John Allspaw sees as qualities of a senior engineer.
Thoughts Notes In order not to confuse titles with expectations that are fuzzy, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to engineering maturity.
Meaning: I expect a &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; engineer to be a mature engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to gloss over the part where one could simply list the technical areas in which a mature engineer should have some level of mastery or understanding (such as &amp;ldquo;Networking&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Filesystems&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, etc.</description></item><item><title>You Don't Know Everything</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/you_don_t_know_everything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/you_don_t_know_everything/</guid><description>TODO</description></item><item><title>Skills of a Senior Software Engineer</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/973e037c-6ae7-4c6a-abf8-57339feb49f9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/973e037c-6ae7-4c6a-abf8-57339feb49f9/</guid><description>A senior software engineer is an amorphous title.

Summary Thoughts Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I&amp;rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people&amp;rsquo;s software.
The second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Senior Engineers Reduce Risk</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/e7753777-506e-490e-b79e-59dede5dce2e/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/e7753777-506e-490e-b79e-59dede5dce2e/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn&amp;rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company&amp;rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Solve the general Case</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/8d287bb5-ccd4-4e23-a3df-7e7a2f929351/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/8d287bb5-ccd4-4e23-a3df-7e7a2f929351/</guid><description> Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance.

&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse. In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church&amp;rsquo;s proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa).</description></item><item><title>Make Implicit Knowledge Explicit</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/8331d841-b588-4780-b730-ded8ada343f2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/8331d841-b588-4780-b730-ded8ada343f2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Zach Tellman</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/d89d29a2-927a-4369-ad45-bc031a2f7266/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/d89d29a2-927a-4369-ad45-bc031a2f7266/</guid><description>Among other things:

Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Deep Time</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/607e152b-fce5-4e83-a88e-58c0f1f5571d/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:07:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/607e152b-fce5-4e83-a88e-58c0f1f5571d/</guid><description>(“Deep Time” 2021)

The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different shade of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

Summary Thoughts Notes The Sophisticate: &amp;ldquo;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It&amp;rsquo;s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.&amp;rdquo;
The Zetet: &amp;ldquo;Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view&amp;rdquo;

Summary Thoughts Notes Title page The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus Introduction Book 1 Book 2 2.1 Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet to-day inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Play to Win</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 19:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc/</guid><description>https://commoncog.com/blog/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28608436 Derek Sivers | There&amp;rsquo;s No Speed Limit https://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win Greedy algorithms Local, rather than global, maxima Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set As an extension: Play to win doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to imply that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to win for winning&amp;rsquo;s sake.

E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.

Summary Thoughts Notes Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What&amp;rsquo;s a zero day? A zero day is when you don&amp;rsquo;t do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that&amp;rsquo;s not the point.

Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.

Summary Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo;; naru is &amp;ldquo;becoming,&amp;rdquo; and the form naritai is &amp;ldquo;want to become.&amp;rdquo; Together it means, &amp;ldquo;I want to become stronger,&amp;rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)
Summary Mastering something requires mastering the literal game as well as the Metagame; in that order.
Thoughts Notes Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called &amp;lsquo;the meta&amp;rsquo;.

Summary Thoughts Notes Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &amp;ldquo;the standard pace is for chumps&amp;rdquo; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you&amp;rsquo;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

[H]ighly productive developers (10x or otherwise) are problem-solving at a much higher level.</description></item><item><title>James Altucher</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/08f7aba1-10e6-4f7a-a595-430d7253491f/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 07:16:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/08f7aba1-10e6-4f7a-a595-430d7253491f/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Thoughts Notes If I say, &amp;ldquo;write down ten ideas for books you can write&amp;rdquo; I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. &amp;ldquo;Hmmm,&amp;rdquo; you think, &amp;ldquo;what else can I come up with?&amp;rdquo;

Summary Socratic grilling is &amp;ldquo;like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly&amp;rdquo; (Alexander 2020). Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an &amp;ldquo;I know more than you do&amp;rdquo;- or &amp;ldquo;Just because&amp;rdquo;-type responses.
Thoughts The learning done through Socratic questioning is worth the potential friction of such a conversation.

Summary Thoughts Notes It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about &amp;ldquo;lotus-eating&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of &amp;ldquo;lotus-eaters&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/d2b00ba2-7832-4bdf-b93a-8a6fd527e5a4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/d2b00ba2-7832-4bdf-b93a-8a6fd527e5a4/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you&amp;rsquo;re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can! But most of the habits we have are habits we ended up with after years of unconscious behavior.</description></item><item><title>Anna Salamon</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ebe7bcfc-87ef-404b-b6cd-e413ab6d8f16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:49:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ebe7bcfc-87ef-404b-b6cd-e413ab6d8f16/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Thoughts Notes Martin Seligman coined the term &amp;ldquo;learned helplessness&amp;rdquo; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I&amp;rsquo;ll call this &amp;ldquo;learned blankness&amp;rdquo;. Folks who fall prey to learned blankness may still take actions &amp;ndash; sometimes my students practiced the procedures again and again, hired a tutor, etc.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Law of Triviality</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/d4dba9bb-3753-45c8-b3ad-396185b2c62c/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:47:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/d4dba9bb-3753-45c8-b3ad-396185b2c62c/</guid><description>(“Law of Triviality” 2021)

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching&amp;rsquo; [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the &amp;lsquo;recognition-primed decision making&amp;rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] a classical adage and oxymoron meaning &amp;ldquo;make haste slowly&amp;rdquo; (sometimes rendered in English as &amp;ldquo;more haste, less speed&amp;rdquo;).

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual&amp;rsquo;s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: &amp;ldquo;meets expectations,&amp;rdquo; gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart

Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains' ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we&amp;rsquo;ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Hacker News | Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career?</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/77775317-1503-46df-87bb-734d1b000c61/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/77775317-1503-46df-87bb-734d1b000c61/</guid><description>(“Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News” n.d.)

Notes Essentially I think learning is fundamentally Pain. You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about.

Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called &amp;ldquo;desirable difficulty&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Milan Griffes | (A)</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/18745aec-fcd1-4dd5-a55f-73fdc409aacb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 13:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/18745aec-fcd1-4dd5-a55f-73fdc409aacb/</guid><description>Milan Griffes, (Griffes n.d.)
Summary Dead links are inevitable if your written content lives long enough online. Include archive links alongside links to off-domain content &amp;ldquo;(a)&amp;rdquo;.
Thoughts I like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that I could automate through some &amp;ldquo;presubmit&amp;rdquo; step of the publishing process. I&amp;rsquo;ve looked around but haven&amp;rsquo;t found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links.</description></item><item><title>Aaron Swartz | Theory of Change</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/6d2276f9-4b72-46be-a4dc-9cdd41997122/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 12:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/6d2276f9-4b72-46be-a4dc-9cdd41997122/</guid><description>Aaron Swartz, (Swartz 2010)
Notes I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?</description></item><item><title>Aaron Swartz</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/62152128-36b1-4229-a6ce-a78858975120/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 11:54:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/62152128-36b1-4229-a6ce-a78858975120/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ox-hugo</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/5b40598c-308f-429d-8a0a-9c72bc1653f3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 09:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/5b40598c-308f-429d-8a0a-9c72bc1653f3/</guid><description> ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This can include personal wisdom, experience, insight, and intuition.
For example, knowing that London is in the United Kingdom is a piece of explicit knowledge; it can be written down, transmitted, and understood by a recipient.</description></item><item><title>Blogroll</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/30768696-732a-485c-8919-43aa5de3b516/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 11:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/30768696-732a-485c-8919-43aa5de3b516/</guid><description>A list of blogs I&amp;rsquo;ve found informative/useful/fun in no particular order:

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/a500c749-aab9-4150-876f-6f40c76bba35/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/a500c749-aab9-4150-876f-6f40c76bba35/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.

Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.
