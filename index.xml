So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read.</description></item><item><title>Noticing the Taste of Lotus</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/noticing_the_taste_of_lotus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/noticing_the_taste_of_lotus/</guid><description>Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”. He’s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Theory of Change</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/theory_of_change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:28:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/theory_of_change/</guid><description>I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, “Concretely, how does one achieve that?</description></item><item><title>Exceed Your Level</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/exceed_your_level/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/exceed_your_level/</guid><description> There are no limits.

The goal of NaNoWriMo is to write 50k words in a month, so I wasn’t particularly surprised. However, from my interactions with others I found that a vast majority of these winners felt like they were pushing themselves to the limit, even though many of them were probably psychologically anchored below their actual limits.</description></item><item><title>There's No Speed Limit</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/there_s_no_speed_limit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/there_s_no_speed_limit/</guid><description> Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &amp;ldquo;the standard pace is for chumps&amp;rdquo; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you&amp;rsquo;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.</description></item><item><title>Attention Capital Theory</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/attention_capital_theory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:17:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/attention_capital_theory/</guid><description>In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains’ ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we’ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Deep Work Hypothesis</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deep_work_hypothesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:14:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deep_work_hypothesis/</guid><description> The ability to [engage in Deep Work] is becoming more rare at the same time that it’s becoming more valuable in the knowledge sector.

Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling.</description></item><item><title>Be Impatient</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/be_impatient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 11:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/be_impatient/</guid><description> Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things.

Examples include biographies, memoirs, and histories.
Tree Tree books are books that lay out a framework of ideas. A good example is Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking: Fast and Slow, which lays out his life&amp;rsquo;s work — the entirety of behavioural economics — in a single book.

Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.</description></item><item><title>Humans are not Automatically Strategic</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/humans_are_not_automatically_strategic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 11:11:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/humans_are_not_automatically_strategic/</guid><description>Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a “fear of success”; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)

I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I’ll call this “learned blankness”. Folks who fall prey to learned blankness may still take actions &amp;ndash; sometimes my students practiced the procedures again and again, hired a tutor, etc. But they do so as though carrying out rituals to an unknown god &amp;ndash; parts of them may be trying, but their “understand X” center has given up.</description></item><item><title>Productivity Notes from Sam Altman</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/productivity_notes_from_sam_altman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 08:43:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/productivity_notes_from_sam_altman/</guid><description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction.
