Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
(“Systems Design” 2021)

the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and the function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams). Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function.</description></item><item><title>Robin Hanson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/robin_hanson/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 09:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/robin_hanson/</guid><description>Among other things:

You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune You are a maker.

Summary You&amp;rsquo;re more likely to hear things you agree with or that are, broadly speaking, aligned with your world-view. Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to over-index on a certain flavor of advice. You may benefit from considering the reverse of the piece of advice.
Thoughts A simple bit of metacognitive advice which I&amp;rsquo;d like to integrate into my daily life.
Notes Advice Reverse You need to stop being so hard on yourself, remember you are your own worst critic Stop making excuses for yourself, you will never be able to change until you admit you&amp;rsquo;ve hit bottom You need to remember that the government can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are counterproductive You need to remember that the free market can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are necessary You need to pay more attention to your diet or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up very unhealthy You need to pay less attention to your weight or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in a spiral of shame and self-loathing and at risk of eating disorders You need to be more conscious of how your actions in social situations can make other people uncomfortable and violate their boundaries You need to overcome your social phobia by realizing that most interactions go well and that probably talking to people won&amp;rsquo;t always make them hate you and cause you to be ostracized forever You need to be less selfish and more considerate of the needs of others You can&amp;rsquo;t live for others all the time, you need to remember you deserve to be happy as well Follow your dreams, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be working forever at a job you hate Your dream of becoming a professional cosplayer may not be the best way to ensure a secure future for your family, go into petroleum engineering instead It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them.</description></item><item><title>Echo Chamber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/echo_chamber/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 07:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/echo_chamber/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal.

Summary Curiosity should underlie a listener&amp;rsquo;s behavior in conversations.
Thoughts Listening well, and asking curious questions, ensures you understand the problem.
I find that my misunderstandings are the result of premature and ill-founded assumptions on my part. There is a balancing act to maintain between reasoning from analogy and reasoning from first principles.
Notes Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners do often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere.</description></item><item><title>Custom Anki Notes</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/custom_anki_notes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 11:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/custom_anki_notes/</guid><description>I use Anki to help myself remember the things I learn.

People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything.

People&amp;rsquo;s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true.

If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.</description></item><item><title>Tom Limoncelli | What Makes a Sysadmin a Senior Sysadmin?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncelliwhatmakessysadminseniorsysadmin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncelliwhatmakessysadminseniorsysadmin/</guid><description>Tom Limoncelli, (Limoncelli n.d.)

All Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man is a 2006 work of science fiction and speculative evolution written and illustrated by the Turkish artist C. M. Kosemen under the pen name Nemo Ramjet. It explores a hypothetical future path of human evolution set from the near future to a billion years from the present. Several future human species evolve through natural means and through genetic engineering, conducted by both humans themselves and by a mysterious and superior alien species called the Qu.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Speculative Evolution</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/speculativeevolution2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 15:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/speculativeevolution2022/</guid><description>(“Speculative Evolution” 2022)
Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Deep Time</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:07:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</guid><description>(“Deep Time” 2021)
Deep time is a term introduced and applied by John McPhee to the concept of geologic time in his Basin and Range, parts of which originally appeared in the New Yorker magazine.
Consider the Earth&amp;rsquo;s history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King&amp;rsquo;s nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.</description></item><item><title>Fallacy of Gray</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/fallacy_of_gray/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:32:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/fallacy_of_gray/</guid><description>The fallacy of gray is an assertion, in the face of a lack of a clear black and white divide, that the cases are all equally good or bad. The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different shade of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

Summary Thoughts Notes The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”
The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view”
—Marc Stiegler, David’s Sling

Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.

All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Play to Win</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/play_to_win/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 19:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/play_to_win/</guid><description>TODO https://commoncog.com/blog/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28608436 Derek Sivers | There&amp;rsquo;s No Speed Limit https://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win Greedy algorithms Local, rather than global, maxima Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set As an extension: Play to win doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to imply that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to win for winning&amp;rsquo;s sake.

The Problem
E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it’s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.

Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)
TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called ‘the meta’.
Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.
What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chinthreekindsnonfiction2018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 07:36:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chinthreekindsnonfiction2018/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2018)
Summary Thoughts Notes Narrative Narrative books are books that tell a story. Examples include biographies, memoirs, and histories.
Tree Tree books are books that lay out a framework of ideas. A good example is Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking: Fast and Slow, which lays out his life&amp;rsquo;s work — the entirety of behavioural economics — in a single book.

TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &amp;ldquo;the standard pace is for chumps&amp;rdquo; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you&amp;rsquo;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don’t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

Summary Thoughts TODO Notes One of the most important rationalist skills is “noticing your confusion”. But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”. He’s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible.

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.

Examples include:
Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards) Spacing and interleaving (eg: Spaced Repetition) To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval.

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.</description></item><item><title>James Stuber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james_stuber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james_stuber/</guid><description/></item><item><title>James Stuber | Master Boring Fundamentals 01: Boring Is Fun</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/masterboringfundamentals01boringfun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:51:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/masterboringfundamentals01boringfun/</guid><description>James Stuber, (NO_ITEM_DATA:MasterBoringFundamentals01BoringFun)
Summary Thoughts Notes We go to incredible lengths to avoid actions that we know are good for us.
Ski enthusiast Tim Peck shows us that there are actually two types of fun:

Summary The legend of John Gottman&amp;rsquo;s marriage counselling success isn&amp;rsquo;t supported by the underlying research at a statistical level; however, the techniques he advocates may help anyway.
Thoughts I enjoyed the personality that this essay had. A more direct essay could have started out by stating the problems with Gottman&amp;rsquo;s research.

Summary Thoughts Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important.</description></item><item><title>Clary Illian</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary_illian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary_illian/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Clary Illian | A Potter's Workbook.</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/illianpotterworkbook2012/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/illianpotterworkbook2012/</guid><description>Clary Illian, (Illian 2012)

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart

Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains’ ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we’ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/askhnwhatwasbestdecisionyoumadeyourcareerhackernews/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/askhnwhatwasbestdecisionyoumadeyourcareerhackernews/</guid><description>Source: (“Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News” n.d.)
Summary Thoughts I find myself drawn to articles and conversations about the meta of work. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a saturation point with these sorts of things.

Notes I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, “Concretely, how does one achieve that?</description></item><item><title>Aaron Swartz</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aaron_swartz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 11:54:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aaron_swartz/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ox-hugo</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ox_hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 09:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ox_hugo/</guid><description> ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.
