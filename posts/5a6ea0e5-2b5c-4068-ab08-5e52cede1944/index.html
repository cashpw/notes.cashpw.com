For two decades we inhabited the double solitude of my family farmhouse in New Hampshire, writing poems, loving the countryside. She was forty-seven when she died. If anyone had asked us, &ldquo;Which year was the best, of your lives together?&rdquo; we could have agreed on an answer: &ldquo;the one we remember least.&rdquo; There were sorrowful years&mdash;the death of her father, my cancers, her depressions&mdash;and there were also years of adventure: a trip to China and Japan, two trips to India; years when my children married; years when the grandchildren were born; years of triumph as Jane began her public life in poetry: her first book, her first poem in the <em>New Yorker</em>. The best moment of our lives was one quiet repeated day of work in our house. Not everyone understood. Visitors, especially from New York, would spend a weekend with us and say as they left: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really pretty here&rdquo; (&ldquo;in Vermont,&rdquo; many added) &ldquo;with your house, the pond, the hills, but . . . but . . . but . . . <em>what do you do</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>What we did: we got up early in the morning. I brought Jane coffee in bed. She walked the dog as I started writing, then climbed the stairs to work at her own desk on her own poems. We had lunch. We lay down together. We rose and worked at secondary things. I read aloud to Jane; we played scoreless ping-pong; we read the mail; we worked again. We ate supper, talked, read books sitting across from each other in the living room, and went to sleep. If we were lucky the phone didn&rsquo;t ring all day. In January Jane dreamed of flowers, planning expansion and refinement of the garden. From late March into October she spent hours digging, applying fifty-year-old Holstein manure from under the barn, planting, transplanting, and weeding. Sometimes I went off for two nights to read my poems, essential to the economy, and Jane wrote a poem called &ldquo;Alone for a Week.&rdquo; Later Jane flew away for readings and I loathed being the one left behind. (I filled out coupons from magazines and ordered useless objects.) We traveled south sometimes in cold weather: to Key West in December, a February week in Barbados, to Florida during baseball&rsquo;s spring training, to Bermuda. Rarely we flew to England or Italy for two weeks. Three hundred and thirty days a year we inhabited this old house and the same day&rsquo;s adventurous routine.</p><p>What we did: love. We did not spend our days gazing into each other&rsquo;s eyes. We did that gazing when we made love or when one of us was in trouble, but most of the time our gazes met and entwined as they looked at a third thing. Third things are essential to marriages, objects or practices or habits or arts or institutions or games or human beings that provide a site of joint rapture or contentment. Each member of a couple is separate; the two come together in double attention. Lovemaking is not a third thing but two-in-one. John Keats can be a third thing, or the Boston Symphony Orchestra, or Dutch interiors, or Monopoly. For many couples, children are a third thing. Jane and I had no children of our own; we had our cats and dog to fuss and exclaim over&mdash;and later my five grandchildren from an earlier marriage. We had our summer afternoons at the pond, which for ten years made a third thing. After naps we loaded up books and blankets and walked across Route 4 and the old railroad to the steep slippery bank that led down to our private beach on Eagle Pond. Soft moss underfoot sent little red flowers up. Ghost birches leaned over water with wild strawberry plants growing under them. Over our heads white pines reared high, and oaks that warned us of summer&rsquo;s end late in August by dropping green metallic acorns. Sometimes a mink scooted among ferns. After we acquired Gus he joined the pond ecstasy, chewing on stones. Jane dozed in the sun as I sat in the shade reading and occasionally taking a note in a blank book. From time to time we swam and dried in the heat. Then, one summer, leakage from the Danbury landfill turned the pond orange. It stank. The water was not hazardous but it was ruined. A few years later the pond came back but we seldom returned to our afternoons there. Sometimes you lose a third thing.</p><p>The South Danbury Christian Church became large in our lives. We were both deacons and Jane was treasurer for a dozen years, utter miscasting and a source of annual anxiety when the treasurer&rsquo;s report was due. I collected the offering; Jane counted and banked it. Once a month she prepared communion and I distributed it. For the Church Fair we both cooked and I helped with the auction. Besides the Church itself, building and community, there was Christianity, the Gospels, and the work of theologians and mystics. Typically we divided our attentions: I read Meister Eckhart while Jane studied Julian of Norwich. I read the Old Testament aloud to her, and the New. If it wasn&rsquo;t the Bible, I was reading aloud late Henry James or Mark Twain or Edith Wharton or Wordworth&rsquo;s <em>Prelude</em>. Reading aloud was a daily connection. When I first pronounced <em>The Ambassadors</em>, Jane had never read it, and I peeked at her flabbergasted face as the boat bearing Chad and Mme. de Vionnet rounded the bend toward Lambert Strether. Three years later, when I had acquired a New York Edition of Henry James, she asked me to read her <em>The Ambassadors</em> again. Late James is the best prose for reading aloud. Saying one of his interminable sentences, the voice must drop pitch every time he interrupts his syntax with periphrasis, and drop again when periphrasis interrupts periphrasis, and again, and then step the pitch up, like climbing stairs in the dark, until the original tone concludes the sentence. One&rsquo;s larynx could write a doctoral dissertation on James&rsquo;s syntax.</p><p>Literature in general was a constant. Often at the end of the day Jane would speak about what she had been reading, her latest intense and obsessive absorption in an author: Keats for two years, Chekhov, Elizabeth Bishop. In reading and in everything else, we made clear boundaries, dividing our literary territories. I did not go back to Keats until she had done with him. By and large Jane read intensively while I read extensively. Like a male, I lusted to acquire all the great books of the world and add them to my life list. One day I would realize: I&rsquo;ve never read Darwin! Adam Smith! Gibbon! Gibbon became an obsession with me, then his sources, then all ancient history, then all narrative history. For a few years I concentrated on Henry Adams, even reading six massive volumes of letters.</p><p>But there was also ping-pong. When we added a new bedroom, we extended the rootcellar enough to set a ping-pong table into it, and for years we played every afternoon. Jane was assiduous, determined, vicious, and her reach was not so wide as mine. When she couldn&rsquo;t reach a shot I called her &ldquo;Stubbsy,&rdquo; and her next slam would smash me in the groin, rage combined with harmlessness. We rallied half an hour without keeping score. Another trait we shared was hating to lose. Through bouts of ping-pong and Henry James and the church, we kept to one innovation: with rare exceptions, we remained aware of each other&rsquo;s feelings. It took me half my life, more than half, to discover with Jane&rsquo;s guidance that two people could live together and remain kind. When one of us felt grumpy we both shut up until it went away. We did not give in to sarcasm. Once every three years we had a fight&mdash;the way some couples fight three times a day&mdash;and because fights were few the aftermath of a fight was a dreadful gloom. &ldquo;We have done harm,&rdquo; said Jane in a poem after a quarrel. What was <em>that</em> fight about? I wonder if she remembered, a month after writing the poem.</p><p>Of course: the third thing that brought us together, and shone at the center of our lives and our house, was poetry&mdash;both our love for the art and the passion and frustration of trying to write it. When we moved to the farm, away from teaching and Jane&rsquo;s family, we threw ourselves into the life of writing poetry as if we jumped from a bridge and swam to survive. I kept the earliest hours of the day for poetry. Jane worked on poems virtually every day; there were dry spells. In the first years of our marriage, I sometimes feared that she would find the project of poetry intimidating, and withdraw or give up or diminish the intensity of her commitment. I remember talking with her one morning early in New Hampshire, maybe in 1976, when the burden felt too heavy. She talked of her singing with the Michigan Chorale, as if music were something she might turn to. She spoke of drawing as another art she could perform, and showed me an old pencil rendering she had made, acorns I think, meticulous and well-made and nothing more. She was saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to give myself to poetry&rdquo;&mdash;and I knew enough not to argue.</p><p>However, from year to year she gave more of herself to her art. When she studied Keats, she read all his poems, all his letters, the best three or four biographies; then she read and reread the poems and the letters again. No one will find in her poems clear fingerprints of John Keats, but Jane&rsquo;s ear became more luscious with her love for Keats; her lines became more dense, rifts loaded with ore. Coming from a family for whom ambition was dangerous, in which work was best taken lightly, it was not easy for Jane to wager her life on one number. She lived with someone who had made that choice, but also with someone nineteen years older who wrote all day and published frequently. Her first book of poems came out as I published my fifth. I could have been an inhibitor as easily as I was an encourager&mdash;if she had not been brave and stubborn. I watched in gratified pleasure as her poems became better and better. From being promising she became accomplished and professional; then&mdash;with the later poems of <em>The Boat of Quiet Hours</em>, with &ldquo;Twilight: After Haying,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Briefly It Enters,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Things,&rdquo; she turned into the extraordinary and permanent poet of <em>Otherwise</em>.</p><p>People asked us&mdash;people still ask me&mdash;about competition between us. We never spoke of it, but it had to be there&mdash;and it remained benign. When Jane wrote a poem that dazzled me, I wanted to write a poem that would dazzle her. Boundaries helped. We belonged to different generations. Through Jane I got to be friends with poets of her generation, as she did with my friends born in the 1920s. We avoided situations which would subject us to comparison. During the first years of our marriage, when Jane was just beginning to publish, we were asked several times to read our poems together. The people who asked us knew and respected Jane&rsquo;s poems, but the occasions turned ghastly. Once we were introduced by someone we had just met who was happy to welcome Joan Kenyon. Always someone, generally a male English professor, managed to let us know that it was <em>sweet</em>, that Jane wrote poems too. One head of a department asked her if she felt <em>dwarfed</em>. When Jane was condescended to she was furious, and it was only on these occasions that we felt anything unpleasant between us. Jane decided that we would no longer read together.</p><p>When places later asked us both to read, we agreed to come but stipulated that we read separately, maybe a day apart. As she published more widely we were more frequently approached. Late in the 1980s, after reading on different days at one university, we did a joint question-and-answer session with writing students. Three quarters of the questions addressed Jane, not me, and afterwards she said, &ldquo;Perkins, I think we can read together now.&rdquo; So, in our last years together, we did many joint readings. When two poets read on the same program, the first reader is the warm-up band, the second the featured act. We read in fifteen-minute segments, ABAB, and switched A and B positions with each reading. In 1993 we read on a Friday in Trivandrum, at the southern tip of India, and three days later in Hanover, New Hampshire. Exhausted as we were, we remembered who had gone first thousands of miles away.</p><p>There were days when each of us received word from the same magazine; the same editor had taken a poem by one of us just as he/she rejected the other of us. One of us felt constrained in pleasure. The need for boundaries even extended to style. As Jane&rsquo;s work got better and better&mdash;and readers noticed&mdash;my language and structure departed from its old habits and veered away from the kind of lyric that Jane was writing, toward irony and an apothegmatic style. My diction became more Latinate and polysyllabic, as well as syntactically complex. I was reading Gibbon, learning to use a vocabulary and sentence structure as engines of discrimination. Unconsciously, I was choosing to be as unlike Jane as I could. Still, her poetry influenced and enhanced my own. Her stubborn and unflagging commitment turned its power upon me and exhorted me. My poems got better in this house. When my <em>Old and New Poems</em> came out in 1990, the positive reviews included something like this sentence: &ldquo;Hall began publishing early . . . but it was not until he left his teaching job and returned to the family farm in New Hampshire with his second wife the poet Jane Kenyon that . . .&rdquo; I published <em>Kicking the Leaves</em> in 1978 when Jane published <em>From Room to Room</em>. It was eight years before we published our next books: her <em>The Boat of Quiet Hours</em>, my <em>The Happy Man</em>. (When I told Jane my title her reaction was true Jane: &ldquo;Sounds too depressed.&rdquo;) I had also been working on drafts of <em>The One Day</em>, maybe my best book. Then Jane wrote <em>Let Evening Come, Constance</em>, and the twenty late poems that begin <em>Otherwise</em>. Two years after her death, a review of Jane began with a sentence I had been expecting. It was uttered in respect, without a sneer, and said that for years we had known of Jane Kenyon as Donald Hall&rsquo;s wife but from now on we will know of Donald Hall as Jane Kenyon&rsquo;s husband.</p><p>We did not show each other early drafts. (It&rsquo;s a bad habit. The comments of another become attached to the words of a poem, steering it or preventing it from following its own way.) But when we had worked over a poem in solitude for a long time, our first reader was the other. I felt anxious about showing Jane new poems, and often invented reasons for delay. Usually, each of us saved up three or four poems before showing them to the other. One day I would say, &ldquo;I left some stuff on your footstool,&rdquo; or Jane would tell me, &ldquo;Perkins, there are some things on your desk.&rdquo; Waiting for a response, each of us already knew some of what the other would say. If ever I repeated a word&mdash;a habit acquired from Yeats&mdash;I knew that Jane would cross it out. Whenever she used verbal auxiliaries she knew I would simplify, and &ldquo;it was raining&rdquo; would become &ldquo;it rained.&rdquo; By and large we ignored the predicted advice, which we had already heard in our heads and dismissed. Jane kept her work clear of dead metaphor, knowing my crankiness on the subject, and she would exult when she found one in my drafts: &ldquo;Perkins! Here&rsquo;s a dead metaphor!&rdquo; These encounters were important but not easy. Sometimes we turned polite with each other: &ldquo;Oh, really! I thought that was the best part . . .&rdquo; (False laugh.) Jane told others&mdash;people questioned us about how we worked together&mdash;that I approached her holding a sheaf of her new poems saying, &ldquo;These are going to be <em>good</em>!&rdquo; to which she would say, &ldquo;Going to be, eh?&rdquo; She told people that she would climb back to her study, carrying the poems covered with my illegible comments, thinking, &ldquo;Perkins just doesn&rsquo;t get it. And then,&rdquo; she would continue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do everything he said.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of us did everything the other said. Reading <em>Otherwise</em> I find words I wanted her to change, and sometimes I still think I was right. But we helped each other greatly. She saved me a thousand gaffes, cut my wordiness and straightened out my syntax. She seldom told me that anything was <em>good</em>. &ldquo;This is almost done,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got to do this in two lines not three.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought this a long way, Perkins&rdquo;&mdash;without telling me if I had brought it to a good place. Sometimes her praise expressed its own limits. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken this as far as the intellect can take it.&rdquo; When she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s finished. Don&rsquo;t change a word,&rdquo; I would ask, &ldquo;But is it any <em>good</em> ? Do you <em>like</em> it?&rdquo; I pined for her praise, and seldom got it. I remember one evening in 1992 when we sat in the living room and she read through the manuscript of <em>The Museum of Clear Ideas</em>. Earlier she had seen only a few poems at a time, and she had not been enthusiastic. I watched her dark face as she turned the pages. Finally she looked over at me and tears started from her eyes. &ldquo;Perkins, I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> it!&rdquo; Tears came to my eyes too, and I said, rapidly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; (That book was anti-Jane in its manner, or most of it was, dependant on syntax and irony, a little like Augustan poetry, more than on images.) When we looked over each other&rsquo;s work, it was essential that we never lie to each other. Even when Jane was depressed, I never praised a poem unless I meant it; I never withheld blame. If either of us had felt that the other was pulling punches, it would have ruined what was so essential to our house.</p><p>We were each other&rsquo;s readers but we could not be each other&rsquo;s only readers. I mostly consulted friends and editors by mail, so many helpers that I will not try to list them, poets from my generation and poets Jane&rsquo;s age and even younger. Jane worked regularly, the last dozen years of her life, with the poet Joyce Peseroff and the novelist Alice Mattison. The three of them worked wonderfully together, each supplying things that the other lacked. They fought, they laughed, they rewrote and cut and rearranged. Jane would return from a workshop exhausted yet unable to keep away from her desk, working with wild excitement to follow suggestions. The three women were not only being literary critics for each other. Each had grown up knowing that it was not permitted for females to be as aggressive as males, and all were ambitious in their art, and encouraged each other in their ambition. I felt close to Alice and Joyce, my friends as well as Jane&rsquo;s, but I did not stick my nose into their deliberations. If I had tried to, I would have lost a nose. Even when they met at our house, I was careful to stay apart. They met often at Joyce&rsquo;s in Massachusetts, because it was half way between Jane and Alice. They met in New Haven at Alice&rsquo;s. When I was recovering from an operation, and Jane and I didn&rsquo;t want to be separated, there were workshops at the Lord Jeffrey Inn in Amherst. We four ate together and made pilgrimages to Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s house and grave, but while they worked together I wrote alone in an adjacent room. This three-part friendship was essential to Jane&rsquo;s poetry.</p><p>Meantime we lived in the house of poetry, which was also the house of love and grief; the house of solitude and art; the house of Jane&rsquo;s depression and my cancers and Jane&rsquo;s leukemia. When someone died whom we loved, we went back to the poets of grief and outrage, as far back as <em>Gilgamesh</em>; often I read aloud Henry King&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Exequy,&rdquo; written in the seventeenth century after the death of his young wife. Poetry gives the griever not release from grief but companionship in grief. Poetry embodies the complexities of feeling at their most intense and entangled, and therefore offers (over centuries, or over no time at all) the company of tears. As I sat beside Jane in her pain and weakness I wrote about pain and weakness. Once in a hospital I noticed that the leaves were turning. I realized that I had not noticed that they had come to the trees. It was a year without seasons, a year without punctuation. I began to write &ldquo;Without&rdquo; to embody the sensations of lives under dreary, monotonous assault. After I had drafted it many times I read it aloud to Jane. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Perkins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Even in this poem written at her mortal bedside there was companionship.</p></blockquote><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bibliography>¶</a></h2><h2 id=references>References<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#references>¶</a></h2><style>.csl-entry{text-indent:-1.5em;margin-left:1.5em}</style><div class=csl-bib-body><div class=csl-entry><a id=citeproc_bib_item_1></a>Hall, Donald. 2023. “The Third Thing.” Text/Html. <i>Poetry Magazine</i>.
