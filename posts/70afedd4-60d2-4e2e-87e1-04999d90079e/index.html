A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people.

An essay is stronger when it can afford to omit qualification (eg: “Perhaps”).  Additionally, for Graham, a useful essay is one which says things as simply as possible.\nThoughts Notes  What should an essay be? […] useful.\n   Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn’t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\n   In effect the [novelty, correctness, importance, and strength] are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.\n   […] if you write a bad sentence, you don’t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\n   There’s a trick for getting importance too. It’s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they’ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\n   The way to get novelty is to write about topics you’ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who’ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n   […] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. […] As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you’re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm’s length with perhapses.\n   There’s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don’t think this is a component of usefulness. It’s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it’s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I’ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader’s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that’s too long.\n   Sometimes the reason people don’t know something is because they don’t want to know it.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Graham, Paul. n.d. “How to Write Usefully.” Accessed February 7, 2022. http://paulgraham.com/useful.html.
