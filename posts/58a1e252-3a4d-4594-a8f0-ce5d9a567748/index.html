Understanding the biology of these human behaviors is obviously important. But unfortunately it is hellishly complicated.2 Now, if you were interested in the biology of, say, how migrating birds navigate, or in the mating reflex that occurs in female hamsters when they&rsquo;re ovulating, this would be an easier task. But that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re interested in. Instead, it&rsquo;s human behavior, human social behavior, and in many cases abnormal human social behavior. And it is indeed a mess, a subject involving brain chemistry, hormones, sensory cues, prenatal environment, early experience, genes, both biological and cultural evolution, and ecological pressures, among other things.

The rooster gives a sexually solicitive gesture that is hot by chicken standards, and she promptly runs over to mate with him (I haven&rsquo;t a clue if this is how it works, but let&rsquo;s just suppose). And thus we have a key behavioral biological question—why did the chicken cross the road? And if you&rsquo;re a psychoneuroendocrinologist, your answer would be &ldquo;Because circulating estrogen levels in that chicken worked in a certain part of her brain to make her responsive to this male signaling,&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;re a bioengineer, the answer would be &ldquo;Because the long bone in the leg of the chicken forms a fulcrum for her pelvis (or some such thing), allowing her to move forward rapidly,&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;re an evolutionary biologist, you&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Because over the course of millions of years, chickens that responded to such gestures at a time that they were fertile left more copies of their genes, and thus this is now an innate behavior in chickens,&rdquo; and so on, thinking in categories, in differing scientific disciplines of explanation.

What&rsquo;s the replacement? A behavior has just occurred. Why did it happen? Your first category of explanation is going to be a neurobiological one. What went on in that person&rsquo;s brain a second before the behavior happened? Now pull out to a slightly larger field of vision, your next category of explanation, a little earlier in time. What sight, sound, or smell in the previous seconds to minutes triggered the nervous system to produce that behavior? On to the next explanatory category. What hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual was to the sensory stimuli that trigger the nervous system to produce the behavior? And by now you&rsquo;ve increased your field of vision to be thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and short-term endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. And you just keep expanding. What features of the environment in the prior weeks to years changed the structure and function of that person&rsquo;s brain and thus changed how it responded to those hormones and environmental stimuli? Then you go further back to the childhood of the individual, their fetal environment, then their genetic makeup. And then you increase the view to encompass factors larger than that one individual—how has culture shaped the behavior of people living in that individual&rsquo;s group?—what ecological factors helped shape that culture—expanding and expanding until considering events umpteen millennia ago and the evolution of that behavior.

Sapolsky)</p><ul><li>Your Highlight on page 11 | Location 164-175 | Added on Saturday, June 27, 2015 12:48:33 AM</li></ul><p>But something subtler will be done, and this is the most important idea in the book: when you explain a behavior with one of these disciplines, you are implicitly invoking all the disciplines—any given type of explanation is the end product of the influences that preceded it. It has to work this way. If you say, &ldquo;The behavior occurred because of the release of neurochemical Y in the brain,&rdquo; you are also saying, &ldquo;The behavior occurred because the heavy secretion of hormone X this morning increased the levels of neurochemical Y.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re also saying, &ldquo;The behavior occurred because the environment in which that person was raised made her brain more likely to release neurochemical Y in response to certain types of stimuli.&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re also saying, &ldquo;. . . because of the gene that codes for the particular version of neurochemical Y.&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;ve so much as whispered the word &ldquo;gene,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re also saying, &ldquo;. . . and because of the millennia of factors that shaped the evolution of that particular gene.&rdquo; And so on. There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets. A &ldquo;neurobiological&rdquo; or &ldquo;genetic&rdquo; or &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.

The second challenge is to make sense of humans as apes, primates, mammals. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re a kind of animal. And it will be a challenge to figure out when we&rsquo;re just like other animals and when we are utterly different.

The evolutionarily ancient central amygdala plays a key role in innate fears. Surrounding it is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is more recently evolved and somewhat resembles the fancy, modern cortex. It&rsquo;s the BLA that learns fear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.

And in that circumstance its activation drives that of the amygdala. Someone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take. This is all about sociality—the insula and amygdala don&rsquo;t activate if it&rsquo;s a computer that has stabbed you in the back. The insula activates when we eat a cockroach or imagine doing so. And the insula and amygdala activate when we think of the neighboring tribe as loathsome cockroaches. As we&rsquo;ll see, this is central to how our brains process &ldquo;us and them.&rdquo;

For example, as discussed in chapter 11, we are our most prosocial concerning in-group morality when our rapid, implicit emotions and intuitions dominate, but are most prosocial concerning out-group morality when cognition holds sway. It&rsquo;s easy to conclude that the PFC is about preventing imprudent behaviors (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it; you&rsquo;ll regret it&rdquo;). But that isn&rsquo;t always the case. For example, in chapter 17 we&rsquo;ll consider the surprising amount of frontocortical effort it can take to pull a trigger. Like everything about the brain, the structure and function of the frontal cortex vary enormously among individuals; for example, resting metabolic rate in the PFC varies approximately thirtyfold among people.* What causes such individual differences? See the rest of this book.74 &ldquo;Doing the harder thing when it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Right&rdquo; in this case is used in a neurobiological and instrumental sense, rather than a moral one. Consider lying. Obviously, the frontal cortex aids the hard job of resisting the temptation. But it is also a major frontocortical task, particularly a dlPFC task, to lie competently, to control the emotional content of a signal, to generate an abstract distance between message and meaning. Interestingly, pathological liars have atypically large amounts of white matter in the PFC, indicating more complex wiring.75

Whoa: twenty units of dopamine are released. And as the monkey continues to get paychecks of two raisins, the size of the dopamine response returns to ten units. Now reward the monkey with only a single raisin, and dopamine levels decline. Why? This is our world of habituation, where nothing is ever as good as that first time.

Though the dopamine system is similar across numerous species, humans do something utterly novel: we delay gratification for insanely long times. No warthog restricts calories to look good in a bathing suit next summer. No gerbil works hard at school to get good SAT scores to get into a good college to get into a good grad school to get a good job to get into a good nursing home. We do something even beyond this unprecedented gratification delay: we use the dopaminergic power of the happiness of pursuit to motivate us to work for rewards that come after we are dead—depending on your culture, this can be knowing that your nation is closer to winning a war because you&rsquo;ve sacrificed yourself in battle, that your kids will inherit money because of your financial sacrifices, or that you will spend eternity in paradise. It is extraordinary neural circuitry that bucks temporal discounting enough to allow (some of) us to care about the temperature of the planet that our great-grandchildren will inherit. Basically, it&rsquo;s unknown how we humans do this. We may merely be a type of animal, mammal, primate, and ape, but we&rsquo;re a profoundly unique one.

Wilson and George Kelling.38 They proposed that small signs of urban disarray—litter, graffiti, broken windows, public drunkenness—form a slippery slope leading to larger signs of disarray, leading to increased crime. Why? Because litter and graffiti as the norm mean people don&rsquo;t care or are powerless to do anything, constituting an invitation to litter or worse. Broken-window thinking shaped Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s mayoralty in the 1990s, when New York was turning into a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Police commissioner William Bratton instituted a zero-tolerance policy toward minor infractions—targeting subway fare evaders, graffiti artists, vandals, beggars, and the city&rsquo;s maddening infestation of squeegee men. Which was followed by a steep drop in rates of serious crime. Similar results occurred elsewhere; in Lowell, Massachusetts, zero-tolerance measures were experimentally applied in only one part of the city; serious crime dropped only in that area. Critics questioned whether the benefits of broken-window policing were inflated, given that the approach was tested when crime was already declining throughout the United States (in other words, in contrast to the commendable Lowell example, studies often lacked control groups). In a test of the theory, Kees Keizer of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands asked whether cues of one type of norm violation made people prone to violating other norms.39 When bicycles were chained to a fence (despite a sign forbidding it), people were more likely to take a shortcut through a gap in the fence (despite a sign forbidding it); people littered more when walls were graffitied; people were more likely to steal a five-euro note when litter was strewn around. These were big effects, with doubling rates of crummy behaviors. A norm violation increasing the odds of that same norm being violated is a conscious process. But when the sound of fireworks makes someone more likely to litter, more unconscious processes are at work.

The researchers indicated that they were already about as close as one could get away with.) If the experimenter was male, no effect. Moreover, oxytocin caused males in relationships to spend less time looking at pictures of attractive women. Importantly, oxytocin didn&rsquo;t make men rate these women as less attractive; they were simply less interested.29

Sometime in the last fifty thousand years (i.e., less than 0.1 percent of the time that oxytocin has existed), the brains of humans and domesticated wolves evolved a new response to oxytocin: when a dog and its owner (but not a stranger) interact, they secrete oxytocin.30 The more of that time is spent gazing at each other, the bigger the rise. Give dogs oxytocin, and they gaze longer at their humans . . . which raises the humans&rsquo; oxytocin levels. So a hormone that evolved for mother-infant bonding plays a role in this bizarre, unprecedented form of bonding between species.

Shock a rat and its glucocorticoid levels and blood pressure rise; with enough shocks, it&rsquo;s at risk for a &ldquo;stress&rdquo; ulcer. Various things can buffer the rat during shocks—running on a running wheel, eating, gnawing on wood in frustration. But a particularly effective buffer is for the rat to bite another rat. Stress-induced (aka frustration-induced) displacement aggression is ubiquitous in various species. Among baboons, for example, nearly half of aggression is this type—a high-ranking male loses a fight and chases a subadult male, who promptly bites a female, who then lunges at an infant. My research shows that within the same dominance rank, the more a baboon tends to displace aggression after losing a fight, the lower his glucocorticoid levels.78

And this includes affecting the behaviors pertinent to this book. Testosterone has far less to do with aggression than most assume. Within the normal range, individual differences in testosterone levels don&rsquo;t predict who will be aggressive. Moreover, the more an organism has been aggressive, the less testosterone is needed for future aggression. When testosterone does play a role, it&rsquo;s facilitatory—testosterone does not &ldquo;invent&rdquo; aggression. It makes us more sensitive to triggers of aggression, particularly in those most prone to aggression. Also, rising testosterone levels foster aggression only during challenges to status. Finally, crucially, the rise in testosterone during a status challenge does not necessarily increase aggression; it increases whatever is needed to maintain status. In a world in which status is awarded for the best of our behaviors, testosterone would be the most prosocial hormone in existence. Oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate mother-infant bond formation and monogamous pair-bonding, decrease anxiety and stress, enhance trust and social affiliation, and make people more cooperative and generous. But this comes with a huge caveat—these hormones increase prosociality only toward an Us. When dealing with Thems, they make us more ethnocentric and xenophobic. Oxytocin is not a universal luv hormone. It&rsquo;s a parochial one. Female aggression in defense of offspring is typically adaptive and is facilitated by estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin. Importantly, females are aggressive in many other evolutionarily adaptive circumstances. Such aggression is facilitated by the presence of androgens in females and by complex neuroendocrine tricks for generating androgenic signals in &ldquo;aggressive,&rdquo; but not &ldquo;maternal&rdquo; or &ldquo;affiliative,&rdquo; parts of the female brain. Mood and behavioral changes around the time of menses are a biological reality (albeit poorly understood on a nuts-and-bolts level); in contrast, pathologizing these shifts is a social construct. Finally, except for rare, extreme cases, the link between PMS and aggression is minimal. Sustained stress has numerous adverse effects. The amygdala becomes overactive and more coupled to pathways of habitual behavior; it is easier to learn fear and harder to unlearn it. We process emotionally salient information more rapidly and automatically, but with less accuracy. Frontal function—working memory, impulse control, executive decision making, risk assessment, and task shifting—is impaired, and the frontal cortex has less control over the amygdala. And we become less empathic and prosocial. Reducing sustained stress is a win-win for us and those stuck around us. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been drinking&rdquo; is no excuse for aggression. Over the course of minutes to hours, hormonal effects are predominantly contingent and facilitative. Hormones don&rsquo;t determine, command, cause, or invent behaviors. Instead they make us more sensitive to the social triggers of emotionally laden behaviors and exaggerate our preexisting tendencies in those domains. And where do those preexisting tendencies come from? From the contents of the chapters ahead of us.

When a rat secretes tons of glucocorticoids because it&rsquo;s terrified, dendrites atrophy in the hippocampus. However, if it secretes the same amount by voluntarily running on a running wheel, dendrites expand. Whether the amygdala is also activated seems to determine whether the hippocampus interprets the glucocorticoids as good or bad stress.11

Failure of ToM: &ldquo;Carolee reads us a story.&rdquo; Carolee, the teacher at her new school. The same logic should apply—tell them who Carolee is.

Afterward I asked her, &ldquo;Hey, why didn&rsquo;t you tell everyone that Carolee is your teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, everyone knows Carolee.&rdquo; How could everyone not?

A child suffers malnutrition and, as an adult, has poor cognitive skills. That&rsquo;s easy to frame biologically—malnutrition impairs brain development. Alternatively, a child is raised by cold, inexpressive parents and, as an adult, feels unlovable. It&rsquo;s harder to link those two biologically, to resist thinking that somehow this is a less biological phenomenon than the malnutrition/cognition link. There may be less known about the biological changes explaining the link between the cold parents and the adult with poor self-esteem than about the malnutrition/cognition one. It may be less convenient to articulate the former biologically than the latter. It may be harder to apply a proximal biological therapy for the former than for the latter (e.g., an imaginary neural growth factor drug that improves self-esteem versus cognition). But biology mediates both links. A cloud may be less tangible than a brick, but it&rsquo;s constructed with the same rules about how atoms interact. How does biology link childhood with the behaviors of adulthood? Chapter 5&rsquo;s neural plasticity writ large and early. The developing brain epitomizes neural plasticity, and every hiccup of experience has an effect, albeit usually a miniscule one, on that brain.

For weeks afterward there is impaired concentration and impulse control. Witnessing gun violence doubles a child&rsquo;s likelihood of serious violence within the succeeding two years. And adulthood brings the usual increased risks of depression, anxiety, and aggression. Consistent with that, violent criminals are more likely than nonviolent ones to have witnessed violence as kids.

Their games emphasize individual competition, urge hobbies involving doing rather than observing. Kids are trained in verbal assertiveness, to be autonomous and influential. Show a cartoon of a school of fish with one out front, and she&rsquo;ll describe it to her child as the leader.* Mothers in collectivist cultures, in contrast, spend more time than individualist mothers soothing their child, maintaining contact, and facilitating contact with other adults. They value low arousal affect and sleep with their child to a later age. Games are about cooperation and fitting in; if playing with her child with, say, a toy car, the point is not exploring what a car does (i.e., being automobile), but the process of sharing (&ldquo;Thank you for giving me your car; now I&rsquo;ll give it back to you&rdquo;). Kids are trained to get along, think of others, accept and adapt, rather than change situations; morality and conformity are nearly synonymous. Show the cartoon of the school of fish, and the fish out front must have done something wrong, because no one will play with him.

In contrast, parenting in society&rsquo;s lower-SES rungs is typically authoritarian, reflecting two themes. One concerns protecting. When are higher-SES parents authoritarian? When there is danger. &ldquo;Sweetie, I love that you question things, but if you run into the street and I scream &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; you stop.&rdquo; A lower-SES childhood is rife with threat. The other theme is preparing the child for the tough world out there—for the poor, adulthood consists of the socially dominant treating them in an authoritarian manner.

More directly, stress alters maternal blood pressure and immune defenses, which impact a fetus. Most important, stressed mothers secrete glucocorticoids, which enter fetal circulation and basically have the same bad consequences as in stressed infants and children. Glucocorticoids accomplish this through organizational effects on fetal brain construction and decreasing levels of growth factors, numbers of neurons and synapses, and so on. Just as prenatal testosterone exposure generates an adult brain that is more sensitive to environmental triggers of aggression, excessive prenatal glucocorticoid exposure produces an adult brain more sensitive to environmental triggers of depression and anxiety.

Stimulating environments, harsh parents, good neighborhoods, uninspiring teachers, optimal diets—all alter genes in the brain. Wow. And not that long ago the revolution was about how environment and experience change the excitability of synapses, their number, neuronal circuits, even the number of neurons. Whoa. And earlier the revolution was about how environment and experience can change the sizes of different parts of the brain. Amazing. But none of this is truly amazing. Because things must work these ways. While little in childhood determines an adult behavior, virtually everything in childhood changes propensities toward some adult behavior. Freud, Bowlby, Harlow, Meaney, from their differing perspectives, all make the same fundamental and once-revolutionary point: childhood matters. All that the likes of growth factors, on/off switches, and rates of myelination do is provide insights into the innards of that fact.

Genomes aren&rsquo;t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another&rsquo;s transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment.

Imagine a gene consisting of exons 1, 2, and 3, separated by introns A and B. In one part of the body a splicing enzyme exists that splices out the introns and also trashes exon 3, producing a protein coded for by exons 1 and 2. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the body, a different splicing enzyme jettisons exon 2 along with the introns, producing a protein derived from exons 1 and 3. In another cell type a protein is made solely from exon 1. . . . Thus &ldquo;alternative splicing&rdquo; can generate multiple unique proteins from a single stretch of DNA; so much for &ldquo;one gene specifies one protein&rdquo;—this gene specifies seven (A, B, C, A-B, A-C, B-C, and A-B-C). Remarkably, 90 percent of human genes with exons are alternatively spliced. Moreover, when a gene is regulated by multiple TFs, each can direct the transcription of a different combination of exons. Oh, and splicing enzymes are proteins, meaning that each is coded for by a gene. Loops and loops.

Vanishingly unlikely. Instead, gene and behavior are often connected by tortuous routes.20 Consider the genetic influence on voter participation; the mediating factor between the two turns out to be sense of control and efficacy. People who vote regularly feel that their actions matter, and this central locus of control reflects some genetically influenced personality traits (e.g., high optimism, low neuroticism). Or how about the link between genes and self-confidence? Some studies show that the intervening variable is genetic effects on height; taller people are considered more attractive and treated better, boosting their self-confidence, dammit.* In other words, genetic influences on behavior often work through very indirect routes, something rarely emphasized when news broadcasts toss out behavior genetics sound bites—&ldquo;Scientists report genetic influence on strategy when playing Candyland.&rdquo;

Most of these confounds inflate the perceived importance of genes. Efforts have been made to control for these confounds and generally have shown that they are of less magnitude than charged by many critics. Crucially, these studies have mostly been about psychiatric disorders, which, while plenty interesting, aren&rsquo;t terribly relevant to the concerns of this book. In other words, no one has studied whether these confounds matter when considering genetic influences on, say, people&rsquo;s tendency to endorse their culture&rsquo;s moral rules yet rationalize why those rules don&rsquo;t apply to them today, because they&rsquo;re stressed and it&rsquo;s their birthday.

I review its logic every time I teach it, because it&rsquo;s so unintuitive, and I&rsquo;m still always just words away from getting it wrong when I open my mouth in class. Behavior genetics studies usually produce a number called a heritability score.28 For example, studies have reported heritability scores in the 40 to 60 percent range for traits related to prosocial behavior, resilience after psychosocial stress, social responsiveness, political attitudes, aggression, and leadership potential. What&rsquo;s a heritability score? &ldquo;What does a gene do?&rdquo; is at least two questions. How does a gene influence average levels of a trait? How does a gene influence variation among people in levels of that trait? These are crucially different. For example, how much do genes have to do with people&rsquo;s scores averaging 100 on this thing called an IQ test? Then how much do genes have to do with one person scoring higher than another? Or how much do genes help in explaining why humans usually enjoy ice cream? How much in explaining why people like different flavors? These issues utilize two terms with similar sounds but different meanings. If genes strongly influence average levels of a trait, that trait is strongly inherited. If genes strongly influence the extent of variability around that average level, that trait has high heritability.* It is a population measure, where a heritability score indicates the percentage of total variation attributable to genetics.

Thus, while genes had little to do with the prevalence of earrings among Americans in 1958 being around 50 percent, they had lots to do with determining which Americans wore them. Thus, in that time and place, wearing earrings, while not a strongly inherited trait, had high heritability.

In this imaginary scenario a single gene, gene 3127, regulates the plant&rsquo;s growth. Gene 3127 comes in versions, A, B, and C. Plants with version A always grow to be one inch tall; version B, two inches; C, three inches.* What single fact gives you the most power in predicting a plant&rsquo;s height? Obviously, whether it has version A, B, or C—that explains all the variation in height between plants, meaning 100 percent heritability. Meanwhile, twelve thousand miles away in a rain forest, a second plant geneticist is studying a clone of that same plant. And in that environment plants with version A, B, or C are 101, 102, or 103 inches tall, respectively. This geneticist also concludes that plant height in this case shows 100 percent heritability. Then, as required by the plot line, the two stand side by side at a conference, one brandishing 1/2/3 inch data, the other 101/102/103. They combine data sets. Now you want to predict the height of one example of that plant, taken from anywhere on the planet. You can either know which version of gene 3127 it possesses or what environment it is growing in. Which is more useful? Knowing which environment. When you study this plant species in two environments, you discover that heritability of height is miniscule.

Here&rsquo;s a rule of thumb for recognizing gene/environment interactions, translated into English: You are studying the behavioral effects of a gene in two environments. Someone asks, &ldquo;What are the effects of the gene on some behavior?&rdquo; You answer, &ldquo;It depends on the environment.&rdquo; Then they ask, &ldquo;What are the effects of environment on this behavior?&rdquo; And you answer, &ldquo;It depends on the version of the gene.&rdquo; &ldquo;It depends&rdquo; = a gene/environment interaction.

Even more appropriately, all behavioral traits are affected to some degree by genetic variability.65 They have to be, given that they specify the structure of all the proteins pertinent to every neurotransmitter, hormone, receptor, etc. that there is. And they have plenty to do with individual differences in behavior, given the large percentage of genes that are polymorphic, coming in different flavors. But their effects are supremely context dependent. Ask not what a gene does. Ask what it does in a particular environment and when expressed in a particular network of other genes (i.e., gene/gene/gene/gene . . . /environment). Thus, for our purposes, genes aren&rsquo;t about inevitability. Instead they&rsquo;re about context-dependent tendencies, propensities, potentials, and vulnerabilities.

This generates various correlates of pastoralism:26 Militarism abounds. Pastoralists, particularly in deserts, with their far-flung members tending the herds, are a spawning ground for warrior classes. And with them typically come (a) military trophies as stepping-stones to societal status; (b) death in battle as a guarantee of a glorious afterlife; (c) high rates of economic polygamy and mistreatment of women; and (d) authoritarian parenting. It is rare for pastoralists to be pastoral, in the sense of Beethoven&rsquo;s Sixth Symphony. Worldwide, monotheism is relatively rare; to the extent that it does occur, it is disproportionately likely among desert pastoralists (while rain forest dwellers are atypically likely to be polytheistic). This makes sense. Deserts teach tough, singular things, a world reduced to simple, desiccated, furnace-blasted basics that are approached with a deep fatalism. &ldquo;I am the Lord your God&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is but one god and his name is Allah&rdquo; and &ldquo;There will be no gods before me&rdquo;—dictates like these proliferate. As implied in the final quote, desert monotheism does not always come with only one supernatural being—monotheistic religions are replete with angels and djinns and devils. But they sure come with a hierarchy, minor deities paling before the Omnipotent One, who tends to be highly interventionist both in the heavens and on earth. In contrast, think of tropical rain forest, teeming with life, where you can find more species of ants on a single tree than in all of Britain. Letting a hundred deities bloom in equilibrium must seem the most natural thing in the world. Pastoralism fosters cultures of honor. As introduced in chapter 7, these are about rules of civility, courtesy, and hospitality, especially to the weary traveler because, after all, aren&rsquo;t all herders often weary travelers? Even more so, cultures of honor are about taking retribution after affronts to self, family, or clan, and reputational consequences for failing to do so. If they take your camel today and you do nothing, tomorrow they will take the rest of your herd, plus your wives and daughters.* Few

Undergraduate male subjects had a blood sample taken. They then filled out a questionnaire about something and were then supposed to drop it off down the hall. It was in the narrow hallway, filled with file cabinets, that the experiment happened. Half the subjects traversed the corridor uneventfully. But with half, a confederate (get it? ha-ha) of the psychologists, a big beefy guy, approached from the opposite direction. As the subject and the plant squeezed by each other, the latter would jostle the subject and, in an irritated voice, say the magic word—&ldquo;asshole&rdquo;—and march on. Subject would continue down the hall to drop off the questionnaire. What was the response to this insult? It depended.

Quakers from North Midlands going to Pennsylvania and Delaware. Southern English indentured servants to Virginia. And the rest of the South? Disproportionately herders from Scotland, Ireland, and northern England. Naturally, the idea has some problems. Pastoralists from the British Isles mostly settled in the hill country of the South, whereas the honor culture is stronger in the Southern lowlands. Others have suggested that the Southern ethos of retributive violence was born from the white Southern nightmare scenario of slave uprisings.

Or maybe inventing deities is an emergent by-product of the architecture of our social brains.54 Amid these speculations, far more boggling is the variety of the thousands of religions we&rsquo;ve invented. They vary as to number and gender of deities; whether there&rsquo;s an afterlife, what it&rsquo;s like, and what it takes to enter; whether deities judge or interfere with humans; whether we are born sinful or pure and whether sexuality changes those states; whether the myth of a religion&rsquo;s founder is of sacredness from the start (so much so that, say, wise men visit the infant founder) or of a sybarite who reforms (e.g., Siddhārtha&rsquo;s transition from palace life to being the Buddha); whether the religion&rsquo;s goal is attracting new followers (say, with exciting news—e.g., an angel visited me in Manchester, New York, and gave me golden plates) or retaining members (we&rsquo;ve got a covenant with God, so stick with us).

To hark back to a theme from the first pages of this book, it doesn&rsquo;t take a particularly fancy brain to learn how to motorically, say, throw a punch.

Not at all (though the MHC protein is being detected by other olfactory receptors), it&rsquo;s a hippo&rsquo;s armpit.*

Both experimental and real-world data show that liberals preferentially value the first three goals, namely care, fairness, and liberty (and, showing an overlap with Kohlbergian formulations, undervaluing loyalty, authority, and sanctity is in many ways synonymous with postconventional thinking). In contrast, conservatives heavily value loyalty, authority, and sanctity.
