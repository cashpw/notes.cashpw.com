You have several other tasks you need to complete and you frequently fragment your time. You feel that you must prevent interruptions to advance this task.</p><p>[Negatives]</p><ul><li>Setting aside time does not guarantee it will not be interrupted.</li><li>It is not always possible to obtain contiguous time blocks.</li></ul><p>[Positives]</p><ul><li>Complex tasks require a certain amount of think time to be completed.</li><li>Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated.</li><li>Smaller allocated time blocks create interruptions that cause you to stop and re-start a task.</li></ul><p>Therefore, set aside a block of time to complete the task so that you are able to perform the task without interruption until you are comfortable with how the task is progressing.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Commentary</p><blockquote><p>This is a pattern about limiting interruptions so that you can concentrate on a complex task. Interruptions can come in at least two forms: Those you impose upon yourself through fragmenting your time and those that outside forces impose upon you. Even though there is a potential task re-start penalty when you impose interruptions upon yourself, there is a quantifiable task re-start consequence when outside influences interrupt you. When you interrupt yourself, you typically do it at a logical break point – a time when you feel comfortable you can stop the task. When outside influences cause an interruption, however, your concentration on a complex problem is broken and you need to re-establish it to continue.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li><p>Resulting Context</p><blockquote><p>Be careful not to take this pattern to an extreme. If you completely de-fragment your time, you will be unable to complete important tasks that may have an earlier due date because you will not interrupt yourself to address them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li>Examples</li></ul><h4 id=single-task-important-items>Single-Task important items<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#single-task-important-items>¶</a></h4><blockquote><p>You have a task to do that you and/or others consider important. Performing this task simultaneously with other tasks breaks your concentration and you find that quality is suffering. You feel that the task warrants a quality level that is impossible to produce if you perform it with other tasks.</p><p>[Negatives]</p><ul><li>Interruptions are an unpleasant fact. It is often impossible to find time to work on only one thing because of pressure from others though in-person visits, email, IM, telephone calls, or pages.</li><li>Single tasking does not guarantee that the results will be better than if you multitasked.</li><li>When you perform a single task, you may be putting off tasks that are more important or time critical.</li></ul><p>[Positives]</p><ul><li>Important tasks, like complex tasks, require a certain amount of think time to be completed. What makes an important task different from a complex task is there is a need to attend to details – the output is important.</li><li>Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated and produce work that is not befitting the task.</li><li>Working on one important task may help you solve another complex problem.</li><li>When you fragment your time by completing multiple tasks in the same time block, you decrease the amount of concentration and attention you can give to an important task.</li><li>There is a certain level of satisfaction knowing that you are producing high quality results.</li></ul><p>Therefore, isolate important tasks and perform them separately so that you have the ability to concentrate and produce high quality output in the required amount of time.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Commentary</p><blockquote><p>This pattern is different from <a href=#contiguous-time-blocks>Contiguous Time Blocks</a>. <a href=#single-task-important-items>Single-Task Important Items</a> does not refer to blocking off time for a task, but refers to concentration on a single important task at a time.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li>Resulting Context</li></ul><ul><li>Examples</li></ul><h4 id=put-it-off>Put it off<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#put-it-off>¶</a></h4><blockquote><p>You have a task to complete and you are having trouble concentrating on it either because it is complex, you are fatigued, or it is large. You find that you are having difficulty advancing the task or that the task itself is becoming more confusing. Most important, you feel you do not have a good handle on how to organize the task, its output, or both.</p><p>[Negatives]</p><ul><li>Procrastination can make a task more difficult to complete.</li><li>When you are extremely fatigued, setting aside a task or sleeping may or may not help you organize your thoughts.</li><li>It may not be possible to put it off certain tasks due to pressure to complete a task.</li><li>Putting a task off might not result in a better organization or output.</li></ul><p>[Positives]</p><ul><li>When you have trouble concentrating, the work you are trying to complete takes longer.</li><li>When you have trouble concentrating, quality suffers.</li><li>Complex (or boring) tasks drain your mental resources.</li><li>Setting a problem aside gives your mind time to mull over the information it has already absorbed while you are doing other things.</li><li>By better organizing a task or its output, it may become easier complete.</li></ul><p>Therefore, when faced with poor concentration on a boring or complex task with a somewhat flexible deadline, stop working on it temporarily so you can collect your thoughts. It may help to sleep on the problem and begin working it anew once you awaken.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Commentary</li></ul><ul><li><p>Resulting Context</p><blockquote><p>If you put something off that will not benefit from downtime thinking, you are essentially procrastinating – an alternate, less appealing resulting context. In addition, it is possible for you to think you can put something down in order to organize your thoughts, but if there is no plan to return to it, it is probably procrastination.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li>Examples</li></ul><h4 id=seek-clarification>Seek clarification<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#seek-clarification>¶</a></h4><blockquote><p>You have a task to complete which is vague or has vague instructions. The task may have an aggressive deadline. Just starting the task to learn its direction does not appear to be an option. Most significant, you feel that you cannot begin the task unless you have clear instructions or you obtain additional information.</p><p>[Negatives]</p><ul><li>By requesting clarification, you could irritate the individual or organization giving the task (discretion and politeness is required).</li><li>The time used to clarify a task may take away from the time you have to complete it.</li><li>Some organizations view asking for help as a sign of weakness and discourage people from seeking clarification.</li></ul><p>[Positives]</p><ul><li>When a timed task is vague, you need to determine what is truly required quickly.</li><li>Vague tasks take a lot of time to figure out and you could be wrong if you guess.</li><li>The amount of time taken to complete a vague task takes away from other tasks.</li><li>Obtaining clarification may help you organize your thoughts and identify the information you require to complete it.</li></ul><p>Therefore, ask the requestor for clarification so that you can focus on completing the task.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Commentary</li></ul><ul><li><p>Resulting Context</p><blockquote><p>Seeking clarification can backfire. This depends on the personality of the person who gives you the task and, in some cases, their power and authority. If the person giving a task believes you should know how to complete it, rather than gaining additional information to perform the task you will irritate them and perhaps lose their trust in your competence.</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li>Examples</li></ul><h4 id=batch-the-simple-stuff>Batch the simple stuff<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#batch-the-simple-stuff>¶</a></h4><blockquote><p>You have many tasks to complete and a number of them are relatively small. The tasks relate to each other. You have a sense that you are not making much progress and you have a block of time to invest in completing small, simple tasks.</p><p>[Negative]</p><ul><li>If too much time is spent clearing small tasks, large tasks may suffer.</li><li>The priority of small tasks may not let you batch them together.</li><li>Small tasks may require input from others and not lend themselves to batching.</li><li>Many small tasks can be similar to (or more complex than) a large task.</li></ul><p>[Positive]</p><ul><li>Smaller tasks take less time to complete.</li><li>Removing things from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment.</li><li>Grouping similar small tasks into task groups may reduce the amount of total time required to complete them.</li></ul><p>Therefore, when faced with many small tasks, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and an available block of time, batch these tasks together.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Commentary</li></ul><ul><li><p>Resulting Context</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the most harmful alternative resulting context for this pattern is if you decide to batch simple stuff instead of completing larger and more important tasks.
