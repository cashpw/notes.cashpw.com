In this case the answer is even easier and more obvious than the first: you smash their bases of power, with violent resistance if necessary. If you want a more general solution that also takes care of the factors that led to a bunch of idiot racists being emboldened in the first place you drag all the billionaires out of their houses and put their heads on spikes.

Because the grim reality is that things look really fucking bad. Ecological disaster is looming, the geopolitical order is paralyzed, and we&rsquo;re not putting nearly enough billionaire heads on spikes to plausibly change it. What then, is left? This is not a question with straightforward answers. Straightforwardness is for victors who get statues and ballads. The defeated operate from shadows and hidden places, and the legacies they leave are cryptic and secret. This book behaves accordingly, and there are limits to what I am willing or indeed able to explain. Nevertheless, a brief overview.

That said, it focuses on two specific strands of thought within the alt-right: their own grappling with eschatology, and their roots in silicon valley tech culture (the latter of which is probably the thing that most distinguishes them from previous far-right movements). It takes as its starting point the work of neoreactionary thinkers Mencius Moldbug and Nick Land, along with Eliezer Yudkowsky (who is not on the alt-right but has a variety of interesting links to the topic). Its ending point is considerably more oblique.

There is no such thing as a gentle introduction to UR. It&rsquo;s like talking about a &lsquo;mild DMT trip.&rsquo; If it was mild, it wasn&rsquo;t DMT.&rdquo; The appeal is obvious: Moldbug is out of his fucking skull. Listen to this shit, after he proclaims that he&rsquo;s going to give readers a Matrix-like red pill (not quite the one offered by MRAs, but Moldbug&rsquo;s where they got the term from14): &ldquo;Our genuine red pill is not ready for the mass market. It is the size of a golf ball, though nowhere near so smooth, and halfway down it splits in half and exposes a sodium-metal core, which will sear your throat like a live coal. There will be scarring.&ldquo;15 I want to be clear, with all possible sincerity, that I love the braggadocio here. I want what he is selling. Yes, Mencius, savagely tear away the veil of lies with which I cope with the abject horror that is reality and reveal to me the awful, agonizing truth of being. Give me the red pill. The problem is, once we get our golf ball-sized reality distortion pill home, put on some Laibach, and settle in for an epic bout of Thanatosian psychedelia, we discover the unfortunate truth: we&rsquo;re actually just huffing paint in an unhygienic gas station bathroom.

Moldbug puts a genuine effort into selling this truth, arguing that there exists a de facto conspiracy of, as he puts it in the Open Letter, &ldquo;mainstream academia, journalism and education"16 that he calls the Cathedral, as it constitutes a de facto state religion that means that democracy is secretly an Orwellian mind control process. And to be fair, Moldbug really sells it, essentially spinning a vast historical conspiracy theory in which the Roundheads of the English Civil War have secretly controlled the world for centuries via the false rhetoric of classical liberalism and the Enlightenment. But it&rsquo;s hard not to notice that this is basically crap. By &ldquo;crap,&rdquo; of course, I do not mean &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; Rather, I mean obvious, in the sense of sounding like the guy at the bar watching the news (probably Fox) and muttering about how &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all a bunch of crooks.&rdquo; Liberal democracy a hopelessly inadequate and doomed system preserved by a system of continual indoctrination? You don&rsquo;t say. Next you&rsquo;ll be telling me about the way the factory farming system that stands between the world and massive famine is slowly killing itself via global warming.

Democracy is endlessly compromised by progressivism, which moves it eternally leftwards with its eternal mantra of change. This is chaotic; Moldbug prefers order. Indeed, he values order for its own sake. As he puts it, &ldquo;The order that the rational reactionary seeks to preserve and/or restore is arbitrary. Perhaps it can be justified on some moral basis. But probably not. It is good simply because it is order, and the alternative to order is violence at worst and politics at best.&ldquo;18 There are obviously plenty of problems here. Indeed, Moldbug acknowledges them, granting that authoritarian structures are hardly a sure-fire path to non-violence. But, he promises, he&rsquo;s got a really great idea for how to fix it all. And it&rsquo;s this, really, that defines Moldbug in all his mad, idiotic glory. How do you get a non-destructive authoritarian? &ldquo;The answer: find the world&rsquo;s best CEO, and give him undivided control over budget, policy and personnel.&rdquo; But wait, he&rsquo;s even got a suggestion as to who: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any debate about it. The world&rsquo;s best CEO is Steve Jobs.&ldquo;19 This is literally Mencius Moldbug&rsquo;s solution. Hire Steve Jobs to run the world.

The answer, coming when Moldbug suggests the terms on which Jobs&rsquo;s governorship should be evaluated, is tremendously revealing: &ldquo;We can define responsibility in financial terms. If we think of California as a profitable corporation, a capital asset whose purpose is to maximize its production of cash, we have a definition of responsibility which is not only precise and unambiguous, but indeed quantitative.&ldquo;20 With this, we have a genuinely tricky moment, simply because of the sheer and unbridled number of unexamined assumptions going on here. In many ways they form a knot too thick to unpick—you can&rsquo;t just isolate, for instance, the idea that a precise and unambiguous metric for how well the government is performing is a desirable concept in the first place from the bizarre and unspoken sociopathy of a view of government that&rsquo;s utterly unconnected to any motive based on the well-being of its population. But to my mind the most compellingly fucked up thing here is the basic idea that turning a profit is an inherently desirable act. Actually, this underlies a lot of what&rsquo;s wrong with Moldbug. It&rsquo;s not that I doubt that he has answers to the obvious question of why turning a profit is a good thing; I&rsquo;m sure he does. Rather, it is that he does not consider this question obvious enough to bring up and answer alongside his assertion.

The first is that Moldbug just rewrote Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &ldquo;the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice&rdquo; as Lovecraft fanfic. This is without question one of the most brazenly funny moves in the entire history of Western philosophy. The second is that Moldbug does not actually seem to realize that he&rsquo;s made it. Think about it. The Cathedral is a vast and interconnected system of media and academia designed to feed the population a steady diet of blue pills and keep them from figuring out that the world is a lie. And one of its most basic narratives is idea that there has been a steady cultural progress on issues like race and gender over the course of American history. Why, then, does Moldbug uncritically accept it?

Indeed, there&rsquo;s actually a significant leftist intellectual tradition that can fairly legitimately claim to be completely suppressed within American culture (particularly American political culture), and that&rsquo;s well-known for observing that revolutions and transitions between ideologies generally come down to people with material power protecting that power.

After all, Marxism, especially in its good old-fashioned &ldquo;a spectre is haunting Europe&rdquo; revolutionary sense (which is a much larger body of work than Soviet Communism, and indeed one that contains countless scathing critiques of Leninism and Stalinism) is absolutely one of the positions most completely excluded from the Cathedral, its use in Anglophone politics restricted to a derisive term slung about in the way that &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; is applied to Donald Trump, only with less accuracy. Even Bernie Sanders, who aggressively positioned himself for most of his career as a splinter movement to the left of the Democratic party, only ever went so far as to use the term &ldquo;socialist,&rdquo; a political allegiance that remains in widespread political use in western Europe. When a politician like Jeremy Corbyn, who is at best Marxish, begins to threaten entrenched power he finds literally the entire media apparatus of Great Britain aimed against him, with even the self-professedly progressive Guardian mostly sighing mournfully about how he&rsquo;s just too left-wing to ever be taken seriously. (And indeed, one of the things he&rsquo;s routinely attacked for is not being sufficiently supportive of the hereditary monarchy.) Perhaps it&rsquo;s true that &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; remain more politically suicidal self-descriptors, but there&rsquo;s surely no standard by which &ldquo;Marxist&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t round out your top three.

Every argument he makes about the Cathedral&rsquo;s insidious suppression of the obviously preferable alternative has, to a reader even vaguely with Marx, an immediate counterpart pointing inexorably to the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is tempting to suggest that Moldbug is a failed Marxist in the sense that Jupiter is a failed star, its mass falling tantalizingly short of the tipping point whereby nuclear fusion begins. Over and over again, Moldbug asks questions much like those that Marx asked, and his answers begin with many of the same initial observations. But inevitably, a few steps in, he makes some ridiculously broad generalization or fails to consider some obvious alternative possibility, and the train of thought fizzles into characteristic idiocy.

Simply put, nobody&rsquo;s quite sure if he&rsquo;s serious. I mentioned earlier how every one of Moldbug&rsquo;s arguments seems to have a secret Marxist double, a fact Moldbug is only dubiously aware of. Land has no such plausible deniability. His entire academic career, spent as part of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit, a bunch of &rsquo;90s cyberpunks loosely affiliated with the University of Warwick, was based around subversive and postmodernist readings of texts in the spirit of writers like Gilles Deleuze. Joining a far-right Internet subculture in an Andy Kaufmanesque piece of philosophical performance art is 100% the sort of thing he&rsquo;d do. If so, though, it&rsquo;s one played with an unwavering deadpan and nary a wink at the audience. All the same, it&rsquo;s important to understand not only that this ambiguity hangs over his work, but that Land knows it, and knows that you know it, and knows that you know that he knows it, and so on.

But then again, the fact that Moldbug hasn&rsquo;t got the goods was basically the first thing we noticed about him. Still, it&rsquo;s an important thing to realize: nothing about Moldbug&rsquo;s supposed red pill distinguishes it from Chomsky&rsquo;s. And I don&rsquo;t just mean Moldbug&rsquo;s verbosity, nor even the basic structure of Moldbug&rsquo;s blog, which he cops to, quite reasonably pointing out that this is how blogs work. Rather it is the larger neoreactionary discourse—the myriad of blogs, subreddits, and Twitters that exist to endlessly spit out neoreactionary memes, evangelizing over and over again, generally to each other, but with especial vigor whenever they find anyone who expresses the slightest skepticism about the red pill&rsquo;s effects. The tone of these engagements is brilliantly satirized by David Malki&rsquo;s famed &ldquo;The Terrible Sea Lion&rdquo; comic, in which two women remark on how much they dislike sea lions only to be chased around by one for two days repeatedly demanding that they provide sources to back up their assertions34. This constant restatement of an idea defined by the fact that it only needs to be expressed evokes Eve Sedgwick&rsquo;s observation of the conspiracy theorist&rsquo;s obsession with telling and retelling the story of their preferred conspiracy, as though they believe that if only their testimony is understood by the right person everything will be OK35. (&ldquo;Come on, Steve. Do you want to sell scraps of aluminum for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?&rdquo; one imagines Moldbug pleading.36)

What&rsquo;s fun is seeing reality from the outside—in other words, watching all those silly little people who aren&rsquo;t clever enough to understand the red pill. Which is a fairly large problem: for the red pill to work, it requires that the neoreactionary have a ready supply of deluded people. In other words, neoreaction&rsquo;s sense of legitimacy is existentially dependent on systematic public deception.

The problem is that neoreaction basically already knows this and is OK with it. That&rsquo;s the whole point of the right to exit—a final and decisive rescue of individual liberty at all costs. But exiting requires that people stay behind; if we all go, we&rsquo;ll just have to storm out again. The entire point of the project is to separate the wheat from the chaff.

And in some ways Land&rsquo;s version of it is the more persuasive, even as it&rsquo;s the less accessible. Moldbug got here by having too much time on his hands and self-educating on American history entirely via primary source documents while stoned. Land, on the other hand, had a complete fucking breakdown. If someone took the proper red pill, it was Land, who clearly stared into some conceptual heart of darkness and was transformed by the strange and alien light within.
