For one thing, it helped me combat the sense of precariousness inherent to the modern world of work: if I could meet every editor&rsquo;s every demand, while launching various side projects of my own, maybe one day I&rsquo;d finally feel secure in my career and my finances. But it also held at bay certain scary questions about what I was doing with my life, and whether major changes might not be needed. If I could get enough work done, my subconscious had apparently concluded, I wouldn&rsquo;t need to ask if it was all that healthy to be deriving so much of my sense of self-worth from work in the first place. And as long as I was always just on the cusp of mastering my time, I could avoid the thought that what life was really demanding from me might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.

It was a &ldquo;horrific ordeal,&rdquo; he would recall years later. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cold that the water freezes the moment it touches the floor, and your towel freezes in your hand. So you&rsquo;re sliding around barefoot on ice, trying to dry your body with a frozen hand towel.&rdquo;

Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals (Oliver Burkeman)</p><ul><li>Your Highlight on page 76 | Location 1162-1177 | Added on Tuesday, June 30, 2015 5:38:05 AM</li></ul><p>At first, this was Young&rsquo;s instinct, too: to recoil internally from the experience of the freezing water hitting his skin by thinking about something different—or else just trying, through an act of sheer will, not to feel the cold. This is hardly an unreasonable reaction: when it&rsquo;s so unpleasant to stay focused on present experience, common sense would seem to suggest that mentally absenting yourself from the situation would moderate the pain. And yet as icy deluge followed icy deluge, Young began to understand that this was precisely the wrong strategy. In fact, the more he concentrated on the sensations of intense cold, giving his attention over to them as completely as he could, the less agonizing he found them—whereas once his &ldquo;attention wandered, the suffering became unbearable.&rdquo; After a few days, he began preparing for each drenching by first becoming as focused on his present experience as he possibly could so that, when the water hit, he would avoid spiraling from mere discomfort into agony. Slowly it dawned on him that this was the whole point of the ceremony. As he put it—though traditional Buddhist monks certainly would not have done so—it was a &ldquo;giant biofeedback device,&rdquo; designed to train him to concentrate by rewarding him (with a reduction in suffering) for as long as he could remain undistracted, and punishing him (with an increase in suffering) whenever he failed. After his retreat, Young—who is now a meditation teacher better known as Shinzen Young, his new first name having been bestowed on him by the abbot at Mount Koya—found that his powers of concentration had been transformed. Whereas staying focused on the present had made the agonies of the ice-water ritual more tolerable, it made less unpleasant undertakings—daily chores that might previously have been a source not of agony but of boredom or annoyance—positively engrossing. The more intensely he could hold his attention on the experience of whatever he was doing, the clearer it became to him that the real problem had been not the activity itself but his internal resistance to experiencing it. When he stopped trying to block out those sensations and attended to them instead, the discomfort would evaporate.

In truth, you&rsquo;re eager for the slightest excuse to turn away from what you&rsquo;re doing, in order to escape how disagreeable it feels to be doing it; you slide away to the Twitter pile-on or the celebrity gossip site with a feeling not of reluctance but of relief. We&rsquo;re told that there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;war for our attention,&rdquo; with Silicon Valley as the invading force. But if that&rsquo;s true, our role on the battlefield is often that of collaborators with the enemy.

It&rsquo;s that we take our plans to be something they aren&rsquo;t. What we forget, or can&rsquo;t bear to confront, is that, in the words of the American meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein, &ldquo;a plan is just a thought.&rdquo; We treat our plans as though they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is—all it could ever possibly be—is a present-moment statement of intent. It&rsquo;s an expression of your current thoughts about how you&rsquo;d ideally like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of course, is under no obligation to comply.

The problem is one of instrumentalization. To use time, by definition, is to treat it instrumentally, as a means to an end, and of course we do this every day: you don&rsquo;t boil the kettle out of a love of boiling kettles, or put your socks in the washing machine out of a love for operating washing machines, but because you want a cup of coffee or clean socks. Yet it turns out to be perilously easy to overinvest in this instrumental relationship to time—to focus exclusively on where you&rsquo;re headed, at the expense of focusing on where you are—with the result that you find yourself living mentally in the future, locating the &ldquo;real&rdquo; value of your life at some time that you haven&rsquo;t yet reached, and never will.

Enjoying leisure for its own sake—which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure—comes to feel as though it&rsquo;s somehow not quite enough. It begins to feel as though you&rsquo;re failing at life, in some indistinct way, if you&rsquo;re not treating your time off as an investment in your future.

The derision we heap upon the avid stamp collector or train spotter might really be a kind of defense mechanism, to spare us from confronting the possibility that they&rsquo;re truly happy in a way that the rest of us—pursuing our telic lives, ceaselessly in search of future fulfillment—are not. This also helps explain why it&rsquo;s far less embarrassing (indeed, positively fashionable) to have a &ldquo;side hustle,&rdquo; a hobbylike activity explicitly pursued with profit in mind.

There are two dozen platforms there, he explains, with several different bus lines departing from each one—and for the first part of its journey, each bus leaving from any given platform takes the same route through the city as all the others, making identical stops. Think of each stop as representing one year of your career, Minkkinen advises photography students. You pick an artistic direction—perhaps you start working on platinum studies of nudes—and you begin to accumulate a portfolio of work. Three years (or bus stops) later, you proudly present it to the owner of a gallery. But you&rsquo;re dismayed to be told that your pictures aren&rsquo;t as original as you thought, because they look like knockoffs of the work of the photographer Irving Penn; Penn&rsquo;s bus, it turns out, had been on the same route as yours. Annoyed at yourself for having wasted three years following somebody else&rsquo;s path, you jump off that bus, hail a taxi, and return to where you started at the bus station. This time, you board a different bus, choosing a different genre of photography in which to specialize. But a few stops later, the same thing happens: you&rsquo;re informed that your new body of work seems derivative, too. Back you go to the bus station. But the pattern keeps on repeating: nothing you produce ever gets recognized as being truly your own. What&rsquo;s the solution? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; Minkkinen says. &ldquo;Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.&rdquo; A little farther out on their journeys through the city, Helsinki&rsquo;s bus routes diverge, plunging off to unique destinations as they head through the suburbs and into the countryside beyond. That&rsquo;s where the distinctive work begins. But it begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage—the trial-and-error phase of copying others, learning new skills, and accumulating experience.
