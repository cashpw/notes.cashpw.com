But what would I do with those hours?</p><p>Given that this was a trial, I didn&rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time.

I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn&rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.</p><h2 id=retrospective>Retrospective<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#retrospective>¬∂</a></h2><h3 id=how-i-felt>How I Felt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-i-felt>¬∂</a></h3><p>Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is <a href=https://www.polyphasic.net/repartition/ target=_blank rel=noopener>repartitioning</a> <span class=archival-link>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://www.polyphasic.net/repartition/ rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>a</a>)</span>. In short, it&rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. You&rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it&rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.</p><p>Nonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don&rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn&rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (<a href=https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner target=_blank rel=noopener>531</a> <span class=archival-link>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>a</a>)</span>), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I&rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.</p><p>Overall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn&rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn&rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I&rsquo;d say that there wasn&rsquo;t such a negative impact.</p><h3 id=physical-symptoms>Physical Symptoms<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#physical-symptoms>¬∂</a></h3><h4 id=sleepiness>Sleepiness<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sleepiness>¬∂</a></h4><p>Suprisingly, I wasn&rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired &ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.</p><h4 id=difficulty-waking-up>Difficulty Waking Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#difficulty-waking-up>¬∂</a></h4><p>I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (>25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.</p><h4 id=third-person-feelings>&ldquo;Third Person&rdquo; Feelings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#third-person-feelings>¬∂</a></h4><p>Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you&rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching a TV show right now&rdquo; before the show is over? I&rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.</p><p>I would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of myself rather than just &ldquo;being&rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don&rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still &ldquo;me&rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.</p><h4 id=headaches>Headaches<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#headaches>¬∂</a></h4><p>I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I&rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren&rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.</p><h3 id=sticking-to-the-schedule>Sticking to the Schedule<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sticking-to-the-schedule>¬∂</a></h3><p>Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using <a href=https://sleep.urbandroid.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Sleep as Android</a> <span class=archival-link>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://sleep.urbandroid.org/ rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>a</a>)</span> and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.</p><h3 id=quality-of-sleep>Quality of Sleep<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quality-of-sleep>¬∂</a></h3><p>I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn&rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.</p><p>Sleep as Android tracks the duration of <a href=https://docs.sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep/sleepscore.html target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo;</a> <span class=archival-link>(<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://docs.sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep/sleepscore.html rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>a</a>)</span> and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My &ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.</p><h3 id=how-i-seemed-to-those-around-me>How I Seemed to Those Around Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-i-seemed-to-those-around-me>¬∂</a></h3><p>I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she&rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn&rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn&rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn&rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.</p><h2 id=sleep-schedule-going-forward>Sleep Schedule Going Forward<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sleep-schedule-going-forward>¬∂</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I&rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.</p><p>I had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don&rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I&rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there&rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.</p><p>More and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn&rsquo;t have more to show for it. I&rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours. If I don&rsquo;t, then why not just keep sleeping through them?</p><p>To that end I&rsquo;ve changed my focus from &ldquo;get more hours&rdquo; to &ldquo;do more with the hours I have&rdquo;.
