It was the desert seen from the mountains above Grand Valley. How had he got back to Grand Valley? He tried to tell himself that he was in an airship. No, in a spaceship. The edge of the plain flashed with the brightness of light on water, light across a distant sea. There was no water in those deserts. What was he seeing, then? The stone plain was no longer plane but hollow, like a huge bowl full of sunlight As he watched in wonder it grew shallower, spilling out its light All at once a line broke across it, abstract, geometric, the perfect section of a circle. Beyond that arc was blackness. This blackness reversed the whole picture, made it negative. The real, the stone part of it was no longer concave and full of light but convex, reflecting, rejecting light. It was not a plain or a bowl but a sphere, a ball of white stone falling down in blackness, falling away. It was his world.

Shevek paused, the collar still over his nose. He emerged fully, knelt, and opened the bin. It was empty. &ldquo;The clothes are burned?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, those are cheap pajamas, service issue—wear &rsquo;em and throw &rsquo;em away, it costs less than cleaning.&rdquo; &ldquo;It costs less,&rdquo; Shevek repeated meditatively.

A person chooses work according to interest, talent, strength—what has the sex to do with that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Men are physically stronger,&rdquo; the doctor asserted with professional finality. &ldquo;Yes, often, and larger, but what does that matter when we have machines? And even when we don&rsquo;t have machines, when we must dig with the shovel or carry on the back, the men maybe work faster—the big ones— but the women work longer. . . .

But all the people he met, and all the people he saw, in the smallest country village, were well dressed, well fed, and, contrary to his expectations, industrious. They did not stand about sullenly waiting to be ordered to do things. Just like Anarresti, they were simply busy getting things done. It puzzled him. He had assumed that if you removed a human being&rsquo;s natural incentive to work—his initiative, his spontaneous creative energy—and replaced it with external motivation and coercion, he would become a lazy and careless worker. But no careless workers kept those lovely farmlands, or made the superb cars and comfortable trains. The lure and compulsion of profit was evidently a much more effective replacement of the natural initiative than he had been led to believe.
