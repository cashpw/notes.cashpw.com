<p>The first month is all about getting used to life with the new baby. Only the most important things are done. Otherwise the following applies roughly:
1st week: The mother stays in bed with the baby most of the time and takes care of herself and the baby. The father takes care of everything else.
2nd week: The mother mainly takes care of herself and the baby, but outside of the bed, but continues to sleep a lot; she may already be taking care of the other children while playing. The father takes care of everything else.
3rd week: The mother takes care of herself, the baby, and the other children, but sleeps more often; she may take care of some household chores. The father takes care of everything else.
4th week: The mother takes care of the normal duties with support from the father, but still takes one nap a day.</p>
<p>Childhood after the first month: The child must be fully cared for.
Bathing twice a week (2 x 0.5 = 1)
Wash 2 times a week (2 x 0.25 = 0.5)
Feed every 2 hours daily (also at night) (7 x 12 x 0.5 = 42)
Diaper every 2 hours daily (not at night) (7 x 8 x 0.25 = 14)
Engage(\*) 1 hour a day (30 minutes of which are active) (7 x 1.0 = 7)
1 new topic(\*\*) daily (7 x 0.25 = 1.75)
1 course(\*\*) per week (including arrival and departure) (26 in the half-year) (1 x 3.0 = 3)
Time spent per week: 69.25 hours</p>
<p>(\*) engage means letting the child play or occupy itself or (called active) playing together.
(\*\*) see spreadsheet. Topics are activities done or skills acquired, they are done alone or with the parent(s). Courses are periodic activities typically organized by a teacher or trainer.</p>

<p>The child is dry and clean. It goes to kindergarten at least twice a week.
Our rule for kindergarten attendance is that it may attend kindergarten five days a week but at age 2 two are compulsory. With each year one more day becomes compulsory.</p>
<p>It can do a &ldquo;solo course&rdquo; every three weeks. This is a course it can attend without parents but with some other supervision. Parents take care of round-trip travel and planning (this will change at a later age).</p>

<p>The child partly prepares himself for bed (independent undressing and dressing, independent washing, it helps with tidying up). It can be left &ldquo;alone&rdquo; while bathing when it is playing. It does three small household chores per week (about 5 minutes each).</p>
<p>At this age, we introduce that the child takes over household chores. The general formula is
(life-years minus 2) times 15 minutes per week. The smallest unit of chores is 5 minutes e.g. setting or clearing the table, doing the dishwasher, taking out the garbage, later making a bed, vacuuming, doing garden work, and more.</p>
