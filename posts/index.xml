Even the best maps are imperfect. That&amp;rsquo;s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists.

While the exact definition has morphed over time, it has commonly come to refer to a concept whereby consistently demonizing or dehumanizing a targeted group or individual results in violence that is statistically likely, but cannot be easily accurately predicted.

In particular, the Euclidean distance of a vector from the origin is a norm, called the Euclidean norm, or 2-norm, which may also be defined as the square root of the inner product of a vector with itself.</description></item><item><title>Transpose</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/df465332-f865-424c-9028-1776dddd1a58/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 05:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/df465332-f865-424c-9028-1776dddd1a58/</guid><description>In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix \(A\) by producing another matrix, often denoted by \(A^{\textsf{T}}\) (among other notations).

In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the linear map represented by the matrix is an isomorphism. The determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants (the preceding property is a corollary of this one).</description></item><item><title>NATO phonetic alphabet</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/c42b21e4-6ddb-452f-acb4-5cf9ab122e2e/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:41:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/c42b21e4-6ddb-452f-acb4-5cf9ab122e2e/</guid><description>The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used set of clear code words for communicating the letters of the English alphabet, technically a radiotelephonic spelling alphabet.

Each Vertex stores an extra bit representing &amp;ldquo;color&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;), used to ensure that the Tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged [Tree rotation] and &amp;ldquo;repainted&amp;rdquo; to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.</description></item><item><title>Height-balanced binary tree</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/86c3b62f-4766-4c76-856b-bebe9fe6d125/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 16:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/86c3b62f-4766-4c76-856b-bebe9fe6d125/</guid><description> For height-balanced Binary trees, the height is defined to be logarithmic \(O(\log n)\) in the number \(n\) of items.

Notes Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s Diplomacy is a masterful, brilliant and provocative account of world politics and American foreign policy from Cardinal Richelieu to the end of the Cold War. Its title, however is somewhat deceptive, because it is more than just an analysis of the tactics and techniques practiced in the conduct of international diplomacy. Diplomacy is old-fashioned diplomatic history which concentrates on the grand strategy, leadership, and philosophy of the great power relationships.</description></item><item><title>Non-zero-sum game</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/9f52c68a-3302-47bc-a4a4-3a4ff20d41be/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 10:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/9f52c68a-3302-47bc-a4a4-3a4ff20d41be/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero.

Summary A discussion of Fully Automated Luxury Communism.
Notes [Della Z Duncan]
And so what about this term, fully automated luxury communism? How might you introduce that to someone who&amp;rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?
[Eric Wycoff Rogers]
Yeah, I would say essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization &amp;ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible &amp;ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what&amp;rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.</description></item><item><title>Robert Frost</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/93bad6b6-218f-4e56-8d63-ed1cb50f66f0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/93bad6b6-218f-4e56-8d63-ed1cb50f66f0/</guid><description>Among other things:

[&amp;hellip;]
Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined questioning that can be used to pursue thought in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the truth of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out logical consequences of thought or to control discussions.</description></item><item><title>Gadfly</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ef091c65-8db5-40c8-b577-e34b3070143d/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 18:41:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ef091c65-8db5-40c8-b577-e34b3070143d/</guid><description> A gadfly is a person who interferes with the status quo of a society or community by posing novel, potentially upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities.

This includes the cases of finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements. There are O(n)-time (worst-case linear time) selection algorithms, and sublinear performance is possible for structured data; in the extreme, O(1) for an array of sorted data.

If he finds another life — another hunter, angel, or a demon, a delicate infant to tottering old man, a fairy or demigod — there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.</description></item><item><title>Disorganized attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/80396b6d-d572-4437-ab2d-698c62a3038b/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 13:27:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/80396b6d-d572-4437-ab2d-698c62a3038b/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s [an attachment pattern that] happens when the negative experience and the comfort come from the same place. We see it in children and adults who are mistreated by the people they trust.
According to Stein, cults foster Disorganized Attachment by being intensely unpredictable. In a cult, you may be praised for your commitment on Monday and have your commitment questioned on Tuesday, with no change in behavior. You may be assigned a romantic partner, who may, at any point, be taken away, assigned to someone else.</description></item><item><title>Avoidant attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/e0b22ae5-2b52-4433-8282-ad86037915d4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 13:22:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/e0b22ae5-2b52-4433-8282-ad86037915d4/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child &amp;ldquo;gives up&amp;rdquo; on receiving comfort altogether.
An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype).</description></item><item><title>Anxious attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious_attachment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 13:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious_attachment/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anxious-ambivalent attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/59ed8490-de7b-4a4e-a5d0-026ea3990d34/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/59ed8490-de7b-4a4e-a5d0-026ea3990d34/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child over-indexes on seeking comfort from their guardians and avoids risk.
In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns.</description></item><item><title>Secure attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4873ac61-c885-41f7-bbba-9269bc91b0a9/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4873ac61-c885-41f7-bbba-9269bc91b0a9/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child ventures out into the world, encounters a Strange Situation, and returns to the guardian for comfort.

A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return.</description></item><item><title>Attachment theory</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5f944538-ef8c-464f-b2da-c0f973558eca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:34:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5f944538-ef8c-464f-b2da-c0f973558eca/</guid><description>References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}</description></item><item><title>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8976f641-f94b-488f-8fbf-1679c0185957/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:29:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8976f641-f94b-488f-8fbf-1679c0185957/</guid><description>\(\href{/posts/tangent}{\tan}(14)\)

Summary You can convince an audience that you&amp;rsquo;re winning an argument, or at least plant doubts in their head, by holding an offensive posture. Display the outward signs of winning &amp;ndash; confidence, always have a comeback, speak in soundbites, attack attack attack &amp;ndash; and the audience may think that you won even if your opponent refutes your argument.</description></item><item><title>Moving the goalposts</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b2575705-10cd-4523-aaa6-153360d7bd07/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 17:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b2575705-10cd-4523-aaa6-153360d7bd07/</guid><description> Moving the goalposts (or shifting the goalposts) is a metaphor, derived from goal-based sports, that means to change the rule or criterion (goal) of a process or competition while it is still in progress, in such a way that the new goal offers one side an advantage or disadvantage.

Summary Broadly, controlling the conversation is about making people talk about what you want them to talk about. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.

Summary A meditation on what it means to be tolerant. In short: tolerance and forgiveness aren&amp;rsquo;t easy and if they feel easy then you&amp;rsquo;re likely not actually tolerating or forgiving but rather remarking &amp;ldquo;No harm done.&amp;rdquo;

This will initiate the release of free radicals and polymerization. The more drying the oil, the harder the polymer. So start with the right oil.
(Canter n.d.)
Strip your pan down to the iron Heat the pan to 200°F (94°C) to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s dry Pour a little flaxseed oil on the skillet and rub the oil all over with your hands Wipe the skillet with a paper/cloth towel unitl it looks like there isn&amp;rsquo;t any oil left (there is, just not a visible amount) Place the skillet in the oven Set the oven to bake at 500°F (260°C) Leave the skillet in the oven for 1 hour after it reaches 500°F (260°C) Turn the oven off Leave the skillet in the oven for 2 hours and keep the door closed Repeat 5 times so the skillet has a total of 6 coats If you try this, you will be tempted to use a thicker coat of oil to speed up the process.</description></item><item><title>Matt Eding | Sparse Matrices</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/26116df3-08f6-4a3d-ab21-c1f33d2facfd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 18:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/26116df3-08f6-4a3d-ab21-c1f33d2facfd/</guid><description>TODO_AUTHOR, (Eding n.d.)

Once upon a time, the planet was tyrannised by a giant dragon. The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived.</description></item><item><title>James F.

VIRGINIA BEACH, VA—In the hours following a violent rampage in Virginia in which a lone attacker killed 12 individuals and injured four others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Wednesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. &amp;ldquo;This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing anyone can do to stop them,&amp;rdquo; said Michigan resident Mark Butler, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations.</description></item><item><title>Percy Bysshe Shelley</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/0d6d106f-5a90-4dff-83ce-0eef1db38c61/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 13:27:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/0d6d106f-5a90-4dff-83ce-0eef1db38c61/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Allen Ginsberg</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/d796582a-b407-4364-ac6f-a925db240b45/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 08:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/d796582a-b407-4364-ac6f-a925db240b45/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Emily Dickinson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/f09861cf-7103-46d2-85b3-3e614c2bdd2a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:13:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/f09861cf-7103-46d2-85b3-3e614c2bdd2a/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title> Emily Dickinson | "Hope" is the thing with feathers</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b0f01042-9128-4189-a344-033496d5ce24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:11:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b0f01042-9128-4189-a344-033496d5ce24/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Hope&amp;rdquo; is the thing with feathers -

the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and the function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

Summary Programs, obviously, hold all of these properties. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:
You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune You are a maker.

Freddish anticipated the ways its listeners might misinterpret what was being said. For instance, Greenwald mentioned a scene in a hospital in which a nurse inflating a blood-pressure cuff originally said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to blow this up.&amp;rdquo; Greenwald recalls: &amp;ldquo;Fred made us redub the line, saying, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to puff this up with some air,&amp;rsquo; because &amp;lsquo;blow it up&amp;rsquo; might sound like there&amp;rsquo;s an explosion, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.</description></item><item><title>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/043438c3-d647-4fe0-a29b-cd1c44e9e3e7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 17:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/043438c3-d647-4fe0-a29b-cd1c44e9e3e7/</guid><description>A specific post-scarcity society achieved through a combination of automation technology and material abundance.</description></item><item><title>Man's Inability to Sit Quietly in a Room Alone</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/68e208ad-a4d6-403e-aae3-2ef207499d99/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 17:14:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/68e208ad-a4d6-403e-aae3-2ef207499d99/</guid><description> All of humanity&amp;rsquo;s problems stem from man&amp;rsquo;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

Summary We &amp;mdash; humans &amp;mdash; should abolish forced labor and replace it, and related systems, with un-forced labor: play.
Thoughts The essay is more focused on goals rather than the means with which we could achieve those goals. The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.
Black proposes converting work to play.</description></item><item><title>Ei Iwarmura</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/14d6d8f8-8ed4-4ab9-bbd3-e2c621da4361/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 14:07:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/14d6d8f8-8ed4-4ab9-bbd3-e2c621da4361/</guid><description>Among other things:

Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements. A substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too expensive. Chicken is a substitute for beef. If you&amp;rsquo;re a chicken farmer and the price of beef goes up, the people will want more chicken, and you will sell more.</description></item><item><title>Linter</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/bb5a1f30-1733-41b5-9c34-bcac7f8cb701/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 10:05:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/bb5a1f30-1733-41b5-9c34-bcac7f8cb701/</guid><description> Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.

Summary You&amp;rsquo;re more likely to hear things you agree with or that are, broadly speaking, aligned with your world-view. Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to over-index on a certain flavor of advice. You may benefit from considering the reverse of the piece of advice.
Thoughts A simple bit of metacognitive advice which I&amp;rsquo;d like to integrate into my daily life.
Notes Advice Reverse You need to stop being so hard on yourself, remember you are your own worst critic Stop making excuses for yourself, you will never be able to change until you admit you&amp;rsquo;ve hit bottom You need to remember that the government can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are counterproductive You need to remember that the free market can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are necessary You need to pay more attention to your diet or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up very unhealthy You need to pay less attention to your weight or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in a spiral of shame and self-loathing and at risk of eating disorders You need to be more conscious of how your actions in social situations can make other people uncomfortable and violate their boundaries You need to overcome your social phobia by realizing that most interactions go well and that probably talking to people won&amp;rsquo;t always make them hate you and cause you to be ostracized forever You need to be less selfish and more considerate of the needs of others You can&amp;rsquo;t live for others all the time, you need to remember you deserve to be happy as well Follow your dreams, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be working forever at a job you hate Your dream of becoming a professional cosplayer may not be the best way to ensure a secure future for your family, go into petroleum engineering instead It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them.</description></item><item><title>Echo Chamber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/3657474e-5e72-4f19-8664-c66583f6310d/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 07:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/3657474e-5e72-4f19-8664-c66583f6310d/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal.

Summary Curiosity should underlie a listener&amp;rsquo;s behavior in conversations.
Thoughts Listening well, and asking curious questions, ensures you understand the problem.
I find that my misunderstandings are the result of premature and ill-founded assumptions on my part. There is a balancing act to maintain between reasoning from analogy and reasoning from first principles.

People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything.

People&amp;rsquo;s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true.

If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about how ideas relate to each other (see Understanding requires effortful engagement and Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented).

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.</description></item><item><title>Tom Limoncelli | What Makes a Sysadmin a Senior Sysadmin?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7af2ca45-ca0d-452d-83b3-a700057009d7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7af2ca45-ca0d-452d-83b3-a700057009d7/</guid><description>Tom Limoncelli, (Limoncelli n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes A senior person demonstrates technical leadership by creating the processes that other people can follow, thereby enabling delegation and multiplying their effectiveness. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to work out the procedure for replacing a bad disk on a server, but they document it in a way that less experience people can do the task. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to set up a massive monitoring system, but they document how to add new devices so that everyone can add to what is monitored.</description></item><item><title>Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/462b9154-2519-45e9-a4f5-35e7c32128c7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:05:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/462b9154-2519-45e9-a4f5-35e7c32128c7/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Metagaming</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5d636267-334b-4a01-b41d-c6cd6e826a26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5d636267-334b-4a01-b41d-c6cd6e826a26/</guid><description>(“Metagaming” 2021)
Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.
Metagaming might also refer to a game which functions to create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.</description></item><item><title>Mentors face inward</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/40d6bbef-ec19-45e2-9fe2-bf6de3c8aded/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/40d6bbef-ec19-45e2-9fe2-bf6de3c8aded/</guid><description>Mentors face inward; toward their mentee.</description></item><item><title>Sponsors Face Outward</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8ff15f08-a2b1-432c-b093-c774ab951f2c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8ff15f08-a2b1-432c-b093-c774ab951f2c/</guid><description>Sponsors face outward, rather than inward toward the one they sponsor.

Summary Thoughts Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I&amp;rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people&amp;rsquo;s software.

Summary Thoughts Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn&amp;rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company&amp;rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Solve the general Case</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8d287bb5-ccd4-4e23-a3df-7e7a2f929351/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/8d287bb5-ccd4-4e23-a3df-7e7a2f929351/</guid><description> Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance.

&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse.

Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Deep Time</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/607e152b-fce5-4e83-a88e-58c0f1f5571d/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:07:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/607e152b-fce5-4e83-a88e-58c0f1f5571d/</guid><description>(“Deep Time” 2021)

The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different shade of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

Summary Thoughts Notes The Sophisticate: &amp;ldquo;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It&amp;rsquo;s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.&amp;rdquo;
The Zetet: &amp;ldquo;Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view&amp;rdquo;

All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Play to Win</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 19:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc/</guid><description>https://commoncog.com/blog/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28608436 Derek Sivers | There&amp;rsquo;s No Speed Limit https://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win Greedy algorithms Local, rather than global, maxima Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set As an extension: Play to win doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to imply that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to win for winning&amp;rsquo;s sake.

E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

Summary Set your editor&amp;rsquo;s column width very low &amp;hellip; 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].
Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.
Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve seem content width discussed often when it comes to reading. A width of 72 characters comes to mind, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where I picked that up.</description></item><item><title>Tim Peck</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/de4c984b-79f6-49b6-bc23-1272eb110559/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:09:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/de4c984b-79f6-49b6-bc23-1272eb110559/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo;; naru is &amp;ldquo;becoming,&amp;rdquo; and the form naritai is &amp;ldquo;want to become.&amp;rdquo; Together it means, &amp;ldquo;I want to become stronger,&amp;rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)
Summary Mastering something requires mastering the literal game as well as the Metagame; in that order.
Thoughts Notes Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called &amp;lsquo;the meta&amp;rsquo;.
Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.
What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ee7ed2c5-dd15-42aa-8cfe-8149ce58473e/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 07:36:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ee7ed2c5-dd15-42aa-8cfe-8149ce58473e/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2018)

Summary Thoughts Notes Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &amp;ldquo;the standard pace is for chumps&amp;rdquo; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you&amp;rsquo;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

Summary Thoughts Notes If I say, &amp;ldquo;write down ten ideas for books you can write&amp;rdquo; I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. &amp;ldquo;Hmmm,&amp;rdquo; you think, &amp;ldquo;what else can I come up with?&amp;rdquo;

Summary A well written essay whose thesis, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to say, eludes me.
Thoughts I expect one could find gold in this essay but I think I will instead read, as one commenter recommended, &amp;ldquo;Goliath&amp;rdquo; by Matt Stoller.

Summary Socratic grilling is &amp;ldquo;like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly&amp;rdquo; (Alexander 2020). Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an &amp;ldquo;I know more than you do&amp;rdquo;- or &amp;ldquo;Just because&amp;rdquo;-type responses.
Thoughts The learning done through Socratic questioning is worth the potential friction of such a conversation.

The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat.

Summary Thoughts Notes It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about &amp;ldquo;lotus-eating&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of &amp;ldquo;lotus-eaters&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/d2b00ba2-7832-4bdf-b93a-8a6fd527e5a4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/d2b00ba2-7832-4bdf-b93a-8a6fd527e5a4/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Thoughts Notes The easiest, very high ROI step is to simply open up a new Evernote document on the first of each month and title it &amp;ldquo;February 2018 Update&amp;rdquo; or whatever. Then just try to keep that tab open. You&amp;rsquo;ll find stuff to put in there. What I end up writing generally falls into a small number of categories:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.</description></item><item><title>Neel Nanda</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/034e5d64-198b-432c-bbba-d5936f92fe4f/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/034e5d64-198b-432c-bbba-d5936f92fe4f/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary The most important traits that you need to have in order to step up in your career are: not settling with mediocrity, having an open mindset, being humble, learning from your mistakes, working on the challenging problems and having an opportunity mindset rather than a complaining one.

Summary Thoughts Notes Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a &amp;ldquo;fear of success&amp;rdquo;; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you&amp;rsquo;re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can! But most of the habits we have are habits we ended up with after years of unconscious behavior.</description></item><item><title>Anna Salamon</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ebe7bcfc-87ef-404b-b6cd-e413ab6d8f16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:49:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ebe7bcfc-87ef-404b-b6cd-e413ab6d8f16/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Thoughts Notes Martin Seligman coined the term &amp;ldquo;learned helplessness&amp;rdquo; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I&amp;rsquo;ll call this &amp;ldquo;learned blankness&amp;rdquo;.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching&amp;rsquo; [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the &amp;lsquo;recognition-primed decision making&amp;rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] a classical adage and oxymoron meaning &amp;ldquo;make haste slowly&amp;rdquo; (sometimes rendered in English as &amp;ldquo;more haste, less speed&amp;rdquo;).

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual&amp;rsquo;s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.</description></item><item><title>James Stuber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/014faa45-9f1d-4203-a935-e317eecf92fe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/014faa45-9f1d-4203-a935-e317eecf92fe/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>James Stuber | Master Boring Fundamentals 01: Boring Is Fun</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/3baf57be-df25-429e-9bd6-5654d2fea9cf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:51:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/3baf57be-df25-429e-9bd6-5654d2fea9cf/</guid><description>James Stuber, (Stuber n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes We go to incredible lengths to avoid actions that we know are good for us.
Ski enthusiast Tim Peck shows us that there are actually two types of fun:

Summary Thoughts Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you&amp;rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total.

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: &amp;ldquo;meets expectations,&amp;rdquo; gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart
&amp;ldquo;50%+ focus&amp;rdquo; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind.</description></item><item><title>Milan Griffes</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/1b788031-6f76-44a3-b540-2a5e752d2289/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/1b788031-6f76-44a3-b540-2a5e752d2289/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Cal Newport</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b89cc482-a774-43af-a690-14ed0270480c/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:18:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b89cc482-a774-43af-a690-14ed0270480c/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Cal Newport | About</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aa3b22f0-3771-464e-824d-8d0eeb7f331b/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:14:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aa3b22f0-3771-464e-824d-8d0eeb7f331b/</guid><description>Source: (Newport n.d.) Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains' ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we&amp;rsquo;ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Hacker News | Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/77775317-1503-46df-87bb-734d1b000c61/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/77775317-1503-46df-87bb-734d1b000c61/</guid><description>(“Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News” n.d.)
Summary Thoughts I find myself drawn to articles and conversations about the meta of work. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a saturation point with these sorts of things.

Notes Essentially I think learning is fundamentally Pain. You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about.

Thoughts I like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content.

Notes I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?</description></item><item><title>Aaron Swartz</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/62152128-36b1-4229-a6ce-a78858975120/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 11:54:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/62152128-36b1-4229-a6ce-a78858975120/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ox-hugo</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5b40598c-308f-429d-8a0a-9c72bc1653f3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 09:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/5b40598c-308f-429d-8a0a-9c72bc1653f3/</guid><description> ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This can include personal wisdom, experience, insight, and intuition.
For example, knowing that London is in the United Kingdom is a piece of explicit knowledge; it can be written down, transmitted, and understood by a recipient.</description></item><item><title>Blogroll</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/30768696-732a-485c-8919-43aa5de3b516/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 11:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/30768696-732a-485c-8919-43aa5de3b516/</guid><description>A list of blogs I&amp;rsquo;ve found informative/useful/fun in no particular order:

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/a500c749-aab9-4150-876f-6f40c76bba35/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/a500c749-aab9-4150-876f-6f40c76bba35/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.

For example When I do sets I make 2-4-6 of the same shape/size/color. They started out being cousins, then became sisters, now they are twins. Knowing I can form a shape with intention was important to me. It strengthened my skill.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.
Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.
Why Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.
I expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment.</description></item><item><title>The First Lesson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7c49d995-a4d4-4c95-84c0-9dae9d8ab498/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7c49d995-a4d4-4c95-84c0-9dae9d8ab498/</guid><description> Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn.

I started tracking my time a few months ago so I could have data to back up questions about how much I time I was giving to studying, working, cooking, chores, friends, etc. The solutions I found for tracking personal time didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the way I wanted to track time:</description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/60abd5dd-30f8-482c-8de7-421e25ed847e/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/60abd5dd-30f8-482c-8de7-421e25ed847e/</guid><description>The unexamined life is not worth living, man.
