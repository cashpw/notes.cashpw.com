TODO Summary TODO Thoughts TODO Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it’s crucial to understand the context around your software, I’m happiest when that context is other people’s software.
The second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Senior Engineers Reduce Risk</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)
TODO Summary TODO Thoughts TODO Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, “risk” is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn’t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company’s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Solve the General Case</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/solve_the_general_case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/solve_the_general_case/</guid><description>TODO Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance.

&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse. In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church&amp;rsquo;s proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa).</description></item><item><title>Make Implicit Knowledge Explicit</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/make_implicit_knowledge_explicit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/make_implicit_knowledge_explicit/</guid><description>TODO</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach_tellman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach_tellman/</guid><description>Among other things:

All Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man is a 2006 work of science fiction and speculative evolution written and illustrated by the Turkish artist C. M.

Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Deep Time</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:07:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</guid><description>(“Deep Time” 2021)

The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different shade of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

Summary Thoughts Notes The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”
The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view”

The Problem
E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it’s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.

Summary Set your editor&amp;rsquo;s column width very low &amp;hellip; 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].
Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.

TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/chingetgoodgometagame2020/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)

Summary Thoughts Notes Narrative Narrative books are books that tell a story. Examples include biographies, memoirs, and histories.
Tree Tree books are books that lay out a framework of ideas. A good example is Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking: Fast and Slow, which lays out his life&amp;rsquo;s work — the entirety of behavioural economics — in a single book.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don’t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

Summary Thoughts Notes If I say, “write down ten ideas for books you can write” I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. “Hmmm,” you think, “what else can I come up with?”

Summary A well written essay whose thesis, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to say, eludes me.
Thoughts I expect one could find gold in this essay but I think I will instead read, as one commenter recommended, &amp;ldquo;Goliath&amp;rdquo; by Matt Stoller.

Summary Thoughts TODO Notes One of the most important rationalist skills is “noticing your confusion”. But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don’t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | SMART Criteria</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smartcriteria2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:59:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/smartcriteria2022/</guid><description>(“SMART Criteria” 2022)

Summary Thoughts Notes PSRT is a treatment program designed for patients with non-specific chronic back pain. The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”. He’s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey_nikitin/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.

Summary Thoughts Notes Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a “fear of success”; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you’re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can!

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people.

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.

There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total.

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart

Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains’ ability to create new value through sustained attention.

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.
