Even the best maps are imperfect. That&amp;rsquo;s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists.

While the exact definition has morphed over time, it has commonly come to refer to a concept whereby consistently demonizing or dehumanizing a targeted group or individual results in violence that is statistically likely, but cannot be easily accurately predicted.

The clay is still visibly damp (normally a darkish grey, if it began whiteish) but has dried enough to be able to be handled without deformation.</description></item><item><title>Logit function</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/logit-function/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 08:42:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/logit-function/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Inferential distance</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/inferential-distance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 09:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/inferential-distance/</guid><description>The inferential distance between two people, the teacher and the student, with respect to some concept one is trying to explain is the set of prerequisite knowledge which is (1) necessary to understand the concept and (2) lacked by the student.

In particular, the Euclidean distance of a vector from the origin is a norm, called the Euclidean norm, or 2-norm, which may also be defined as the square root of the inner product of a vector with itself.</description></item><item><title>Transpose</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/transpose/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 05:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/transpose/</guid><description>In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix \(A\) by producing another matrix, often denoted by \(A^{\textsf{T}}\) (among other notations).

A tree rotation moves one [Vertex] up in the tree and one [Vertex] down. It is used to change the shape of the tree, and in particular to decrease its height by moving smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up, resulting in improved performance of many tree operations.</description></item><item><title>Determinant</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/determinant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 07:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/determinant/</guid><description>In mathematics, the determinant is a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a square matrix.

Notes Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s Diplomacy is a masterful, brilliant and provocative account of world politics and American foreign policy from Cardinal Richelieu to the end of the Cold War. Its title, however is somewhat deceptive, because it is more than just an analysis of the tactics and techniques practiced in the conduct of international diplomacy.

Notes [Della Z Duncan]
And so what about this term, fully automated luxury communism? How might you introduce that to someone who&amp;rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?
[Eric Wycoff Rogers]
Yeah, I would say essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization &amp;ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible &amp;ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what&amp;rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.</description></item><item><title>Robert Frost</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/robert-frost/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/robert-frost/</guid><description>Among other things:

Socratic questioning is a form of disciplined questioning that can be used to pursue thought in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the truth of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we do not know, to follow out logical consequences of thought or to control discussions.</description></item><item><title>Gadfly</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/gadfly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 18:41:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/gadfly/</guid><description> A gadfly is a person who interferes with the status quo of a society or community by posing novel, potentially upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities.

A binary heap is defined as a binary tree with two additional constraints:
Shape property: a binary heap is a Complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.</description></item><item><title>Lisp</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/lisp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:45:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/lisp/</guid><description>Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
[&amp;hellip;]
The name LISP derives from &amp;ldquo;LISt Processor&amp;rdquo;. Linked lists are one of Lisp&amp;rsquo;s major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.</description></item><item><title>Atom</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/atom/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/atom/</guid><description>An atom, in Lisp, is an indivisible thing. Examples include:
Numbers (e.g. 12) Strings (e.g. foo) Symbols (e.g. + or 'pi) This term comes from the historical meaning of the word atom, which means &amp;ldquo;indivisible&amp;rdquo;. As far as Lisp is concerned, the words we have been using in the lists cannot be divided into any smaller parts and still mean the same thing as part of a program; likewise with numbers and single character symbols like &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Symbolic expression</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/symbolic-expression/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:13:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/symbolic-expression/</guid><description>In computer programming, an S-expression (or symbolic expression, abbreviated as sexpr or sexp) is an expression in a like-named notation for nested list (tree-structured) data. S-expressions were invented for and popularized by the programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data.
In the usual parenthesized syntax of Lisp, an S-expression is classically defined as:

Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.</description></item><item><title>Priority queue</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/priority-queue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/priority-queue/</guid><description>In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue [Queue] or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a &amp;ldquo;priority&amp;rdquo; associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.
[&amp;hellip;]
To improve performance, priority queues are typically based on a heap [Heap], giving O(log n) performance for inserts and removals, and O(n) to build the heap initially from a set of n elements.</description></item><item><title>Queue</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/queue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/queue/</guid><description>A queue is an Abstract data type.
In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.
[&amp;hellip;]
The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue.</description></item><item><title>Balanced binary tree</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/balanced-binary-tree/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:26:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/balanced-binary-tree/</guid><description> A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype).</description></item><item><title>Anxious attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious-attachment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 13:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious-attachment/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anxious-ambivalent attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious-ambivalent-attachment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/anxious-ambivalent-attachment/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child over-indexes on seeking comfort from their guardians and avoids risk.
In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns.</description></item><item><title>Secure attachment</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/secure-attachment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 11:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/secure-attachment/</guid><description>An attachment pattern in which the child ventures out into the world, encounters a Strange Situation, and returns to the guardian for comfort.

To the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right.

Summary Broadly, controlling the conversation is about making people talk about what you want them to talk about. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.

Summary A meditation on what it means to be tolerant. In short: tolerance and forgiveness aren&amp;rsquo;t easy and if they feel easy then you&amp;rsquo;re likely not actually tolerating or forgiving but rather remarking &amp;ldquo;No harm done.&amp;rdquo;

(Canter n.d.)
Strip your pan down to the iron Heat the pan to 200°F (94°C) to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s dry Pour a little flaxseed oil on the skillet and rub the oil all over with your hands Wipe the skillet with a paper/cloth towel unitl it looks like there isn&amp;rsquo;t any oil left (there is, just not a visible amount) Place the skillet in the oven Set the oven to bake at 500°F (260°C) Leave the skillet in the oven for 1 hour after it reaches 500°F (260°C) Turn the oven off Leave the skillet in the oven for 2 hours and keep the door closed Repeat 5 times so the skillet has a total of 6 coats If you try this, you will be tempted to use a thicker coat of oil to speed up the process.</description></item><item><title>Matt Eding | Sparse Matrices</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/matt-eding-sparse-matrices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 18:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/matt-eding-sparse-matrices/</guid><description>TODO_AUTHOR, (Eding n.d.)

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and the function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

Summary We &amp;mdash; humans &amp;mdash; should abolish forced labor and replace it, and related systems, with un-forced labor: play.
Thoughts The essay is more focused on goals rather than the means with which we could achieve those goals. The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.

Summary You&amp;rsquo;re more likely to hear things you agree with or that are, broadly speaking, aligned with your world-view. Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to over-index on a certain flavor of advice. You may benefit from considering the reverse of the piece of advice.
Thoughts A simple bit of metacognitive advice which I&amp;rsquo;d like to integrate into my daily life.
Notes Advice Reverse You need to stop being so hard on yourself, remember you are your own worst critic Stop making excuses for yourself, you will never be able to change until you admit you&amp;rsquo;ve hit bottom You need to remember that the government can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are counterproductive You need to remember that the free market can&amp;rsquo;t solve all problems and that some regulations are necessary You need to pay more attention to your diet or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up very unhealthy You need to pay less attention to your weight or you&amp;rsquo;ll end up in a spiral of shame and self-loathing and at risk of eating disorders You need to be more conscious of how your actions in social situations can make other people uncomfortable and violate their boundaries You need to overcome your social phobia by realizing that most interactions go well and that probably talking to people won&amp;rsquo;t always make them hate you and cause you to be ostracized forever You need to be less selfish and more considerate of the needs of others You can&amp;rsquo;t live for others all the time, you need to remember you deserve to be happy as well Follow your dreams, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be working forever at a job you hate Your dream of becoming a professional cosplayer may not be the best way to ensure a secure future for your family, go into petroleum engineering instead It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them.</description></item><item><title>Echo Chamber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/echo-chamber/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 07:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/echo-chamber/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] an echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal.

Summary Curiosity should underlie a listener&amp;rsquo;s behavior in conversations.
Thoughts Listening well, and asking curious questions, ensures you understand the problem.
I find that my misunderstandings are the result of premature and ill-founded assumptions on my part. There is a balancing act to maintain between reasoning from analogy and reasoning from first principles.

If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;.

Summary Thoughts Notes A senior person demonstrates technical leadership by creating the processes that other people can follow, thereby enabling delegation and multiplying their effectiveness.

Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.
Metagaming might also refer to a game which functions to create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.</description></item><item><title>Mentors face inward</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mentors-face-inward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mentors-face-inward/</guid><description>Mentors face inward; toward their mentee.</description></item><item><title>Sponsors Face Outward</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/sponsors-face-outward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/sponsors-face-outward/</guid><description>Sponsors face outward, rather than inward toward the one they sponsor.

Thoughts Notes In order not to confuse titles with expectations that are fuzzy, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to engineering maturity.
Meaning: I expect a &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; engineer to be a mature engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to gloss over the part where one could simply list the technical areas in which a mature engineer should have some level of mastery or understanding (such as &amp;ldquo;Networking&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Filesystems&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, etc.</description></item><item><title>You Don't Know Everything</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/you-dont-know-everything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/you-dont-know-everything/</guid><description>TODO</description></item><item><title>Skills of a Senior Software Engineer</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/skills-of-a-senior-software-engineer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/skills-of-a-senior-software-engineer/</guid><description>A senior software engineer is an amorphous title.

Summary Thoughts Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I&amp;rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people&amp;rsquo;s software.
The second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Senior Engineers Reduce Risk</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach-tellman-senior-engineers-reduce-risk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach-tellman-senior-engineers-reduce-risk/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn&amp;rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company&amp;rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Solve the general Case</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/solve-the-general-case/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:23:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/solve-the-general-case/</guid><description> Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance.

&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse. In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church&amp;rsquo;s proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa).</description></item><item><title>Make Implicit Knowledge Explicit</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/make-implicit-knowledge-explicit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/make-implicit-knowledge-explicit/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Zach Tellman</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach-tellman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/zach-tellman/</guid><description>Among other things:

But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Play to Win</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/play-to-win/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 19:22:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/play-to-win/</guid><description>https://commoncog.com/blog/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28608436 Derek Sivers | There&amp;rsquo;s No Speed Limit https://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win Greedy algorithms Local, rather than global, maxima Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set As an extension: Play to win doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to imply that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to win for winning&amp;rsquo;s sake.

E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.

Summary Thoughts Notes Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What&amp;rsquo;s a zero day? A zero day is when you don&amp;rsquo;t do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. The point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system.</description></item><item><title>No Zero Days</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/no-zero-days/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 08:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/no-zero-days/</guid><description>Make at least a little bit of progress every day.

Summary Set your editor&amp;rsquo;s column width very low &amp;hellip; 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].
Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.

Summary Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo;; naru is &amp;ldquo;becoming,&amp;rdquo; and the form naritai is &amp;ldquo;want to become.&amp;rdquo; Together it means, &amp;ldquo;I want to become stronger,&amp;rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cedric-chin-to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cedric-chin-to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)
Summary Mastering something requires mastering the literal game as well as the Metagame; in that order.
Thoughts Notes Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called &amp;lsquo;the meta&amp;rsquo;.
Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.
What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cedric-chin-the-three-kinds-of-non-fiction-books/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 07:36:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cedric-chin-the-three-kinds-of-non-fiction-books/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2018)

Summary Thoughts Notes Kimo&amp;rsquo;s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me that &amp;ldquo;the standard pace is for chumps&amp;rdquo; — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you&amp;rsquo;re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of life, not just school.

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.
Notes I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone 10x faster than their peers in solving well-defined programming problems.

Summary Thoughts Notes If I say, &amp;ldquo;write down ten ideas for books you can write&amp;rdquo; I bet you can easily write down four or five. I can write down four or five right now. But at six it starts to get hard. &amp;ldquo;Hmmm,&amp;rdquo; you think, &amp;ldquo;what else can I come up with?&amp;rdquo;

Summary A well written essay whose thesis, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit embarrassed to say, eludes me.
Thoughts I expect one could find gold in this essay but I think I will instead read, as one commenter recommended, &amp;ldquo;Goliath&amp;rdquo; by Matt Stoller.

Summary Socratic grilling is &amp;ldquo;like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly&amp;rdquo; (Alexander 2020). Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an &amp;ldquo;I know more than you do&amp;rdquo;- or &amp;ldquo;Just because&amp;rdquo;-type responses.
Thoughts The learning done through Socratic questioning is worth the potential friction of such a conversation.

Summary Thoughts Notes It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about &amp;ldquo;lotus-eating&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of &amp;ldquo;lotus-eaters&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey-nikitin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexey-nikitin/</guid><description>Among other things:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you&amp;rsquo;re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can!

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/scott-alexander-for-then-against-high-saturated-fat-diets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/scott-alexander-for-then-against-high-saturated-fat-diets/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching&amp;rsquo; [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the &amp;lsquo;recognition-primed decision making&amp;rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/wikipedia-festina-lente/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/wikipedia-festina-lente/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] a classical adage and oxymoron meaning &amp;ldquo;make haste slowly&amp;rdquo; (sometimes rendered in English as &amp;ldquo;more haste, less speed&amp;rdquo;).

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual&amp;rsquo;s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.</description></item><item><title>James Stuber</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james-stuber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james-stuber/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>James Stuber | Master Boring Fundamentals 01: Boring Is Fun</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james-stuber-master-boring-fundamentals-01-boring-is-fun/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:51:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/james-stuber-master-boring-fundamentals-01-boring-is-fun/</guid><description>James Stuber, (Stuber n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes We go to incredible lengths to avoid actions that we know are good for us.
Ski enthusiast Tim Peck shows us that there are actually two types of fun:

Summary The legend of John Gottman&amp;rsquo;s marriage counselling success isn&amp;rsquo;t supported by the underlying research at a statistical level; however, the techniques he advocates may help anyway.
Thoughts I enjoyed the personality that this essay had. A more direct essay could have started out by stating the problems with Gottman&amp;rsquo;s research.

Summary Thoughts Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you&amp;rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s the main reason that speed is important.</description></item><item><title>Clary Illian</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary-illian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary-illian/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Clary Illian | A Potter's Workbook.</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary-illian-a-potters-workbook./</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/clary-illian-a-potters-workbook./</guid><description>Clary Illian, (Illian 2012)
Summary Thoughts Notes Skeleton Contents Acknowledgments Truth to Process As an apprentice at the Leach Pottery in 1964 and 1965, I helped produce a line of standard ware shapes.

Summary Thoughts Notes The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: &amp;ldquo;meets expectations,&amp;rdquo; gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart
&amp;ldquo;50%+ focus&amp;rdquo; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind.</description></item><item><title>Milan Griffes</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/milan-griffes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/milan-griffes/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Cal Newport</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cal-newport/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:18:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cal-newport/</guid><description>:noexport:</description></item><item><title>Cal Newport | About</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cal-newport-about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:14:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/cal-newport-about/</guid><description>Source: (Newport n.d.) Author: Cal Newport Summary Thoughts Notes In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains' ability to create new value through sustained attention. At the moment, most individuals and organizations are terrible at optimizing this resource, prioritizing instead the convenience and flexibility of persistent, unstructured messaging (e.g., email and IM). I predict that as this sector evolves, we&amp;rsquo;ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.</description></item><item><title>Hacker News | Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hacker-news-ask-hn-what-was-the-best-decision-you-made-in-your-career/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 15:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hacker-news-ask-hn-what-was-the-best-decision-you-made-in-your-career/</guid><description>(“Ask HN: What Was the Best Decision You Made in Your Career? | Hacker News” n.d.)
Summary Thoughts I find myself drawn to articles and conversations about the meta of work. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a saturation point with these sorts of things. To put it to words, I think there&amp;rsquo;s a part of me that hopes that the difficulty I find in work isn&amp;rsquo;t intrinsic to the work but rather the result of some aspect of the process by which I do the work.</description></item><item><title>Hacker News | Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hacker-news-ask-hn-how-do-you-learn-complex-dense-technical-information/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 14:56:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hacker-news-ask-hn-how-do-you-learn-complex-dense-technical-information/</guid><description>(“Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?” n.d.)

Summary Dead links are inevitable if your written content lives long enough online. Include archive links alongside links to off-domain content &amp;ldquo;(a)&amp;rdquo;.
Thoughts I like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that I could automate through some &amp;ldquo;presubmit&amp;rdquo; step of the publishing process.

Notes I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change.
A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?</description></item><item><title>Aaron Swartz</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aaron-swartz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 11:54:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/aaron-swartz/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ox-hugo</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ox-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 09:06:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ox-hugo/</guid><description> ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics-exercises/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.
Throw repeatedly for consistency: Throw 10/25/50/100/&amp;hellip; of the same form (eg: a mug) from the same amount of clay and attempt to form them as consistently as you can. Compare them afterward, note differences, and consider what you can do to improve your consistency. Throw repeatedly for creativity: Throw 10/25/50/100/&amp;hellip; different variations on the same form (eg: a vase). This exercise is about pushing yourself to be creative and explore the form you&amp;rsquo;re throwing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramists/Potters I Follow</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists/potters-i-follow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 22:39:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists/potters-i-follow/</guid><description> Florian Gadsby Bill van Gilder Dear Ali Hsinchuen Lin Shinobu Hashimoto Earth Nation Ceramics Lilly Maetzig Ingleton Pottery Ei Iwarmura</description></item><item><title>Ceramics/Pottery Resources</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics/pottery-resources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 20:16:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics/pottery-resources/</guid><description>Learn Classes Understanding Pottery Series Books A Potter&amp;rsquo;s Workbook Mastering The Potter&amp;rsquo;s Wheel Community Conferences National Council on Education for the Ceramics Arts (NCECA), WatchNCECA Material Stores clay-king.net Tools Kanna DIY Chattering Tools Pottery Tool - DIY Hacksaw Blade Trim Tool 382.

Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.

Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.
