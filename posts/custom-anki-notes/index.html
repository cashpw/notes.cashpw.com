Two cards are created for each instance of this note. The first asks me to recall the definition given the term and the context. The second asks me to recall the term given the definition and the context.\nDownload Definition note\nDescribe For prompting a more well-rounded description of a concept, rather than a single point.\nThe Describe note includes fields for the concept, context, description, and source.

One more card is created, regardless of the number of symbols I provide, which asks me to recall all of the symbols given the description and context.\nDownload Denotes note\nEquivalence For mathematical equivalencies: A = B = C.\nThe Equivalence note includes six pairs of fields for an expression and label: Expression1, Label1, Expression2, Label2, etc. The labels are used to imitate the appearance of a labeled Cloze deletion (eg: The quick [color] fox jumps over the lazy dog).
