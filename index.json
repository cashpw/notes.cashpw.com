Anything you notice that surprises you, who\u0026rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n  [\u0026hellip;] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is a desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.  One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.   The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.  There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; study method, though some are better than others. The study method which will be most effective will depend on the situation in which you will need to recall the information.    Terms  Testing Effect Item-specific Processing Relational Processing Permastore  Thoughts Anki seems highly relevant here; it combines spaced repetition and the benefits of the testing effect. However, I think it would be easy to create flashcards which aid in memorizing a fact but not in understanding or application. For instance: I could imagine a card which asks you to recall the abstract steps required to multiply a IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix. I think this card, on its own, would not be sufficient to maintain understanding or the ability to perform matrix multiplication. Perhaps you could supplement the card with others which ask:\n What conditions are necessary to multiply two matrices (AxB and CxD)? A card, or several, which provide specific examples using numbers rather than generalizations? Perhaps there is a script or addon which allows for this sort of thing.  I worry that Anki wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough to maintain understanding and the ability to apply this knowledge even with these, and more, cards. It would certainly reduce the barrier to re-entry. I used to understand much more calculus than I could prove to you now after letting it fall out of my mind since college. Keeping up with calculus topics, example problems, definitions, etc, through Anki would at least make it easier for me to jump back in should the need arise. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be as \u0026ldquo;on the ball\u0026rdquo; as I would if I were actively using and practicing calculus regularly, but I would be at a better place than I am now.\nMemory in Educational Settings Guiding Theoretical Principles Introducing \u0026ldquo;Desirable Difficulties\u0026rdquo; During Learning  Performance during learning is a poor predictor of future performance because it reflects the momentary accessibility of knowledge (i.e., retrieval strength) rather than how well it has been stored in memory (i.e., storage strength)\n  Storage strength increases when a memory is retrieved or the event is reexperienced.\n  [I]f knowledge is to be retained over long periods of time, then the goal of learning must be to increase storage strength, not momentary accessibility.\n  Based on the distinction between retrieval strength and storage strength, R. A. Bjork and colleagues developed the concept of “desirable difficulties” in learning (Bjork, 1994a, 1994b; Christina \u0026amp; Bjork, 1991; Schmidt \u0026amp; Bjork, 1992). The main idea is that introducing difficulties during learning will result in superior long-term retention because the greatest gains in storage strength occur when retrieval strength is low. For example, consider the practice of using flash cards to study vocabulary words. If you study a word and then try to remember it immediately, then the gain in storage strength will be relatively low because it is so easy to retrieve the word right away (retrieval strength is high). However, if you wait 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the word (when retrieval strength will be lower), then the gain in storage strength will be larger. The implication for educational practice is that instead of arranging the conditions of learning to be easier and faster for the learner, educators should introduce difficulties into the learning process in order to promote long-term retention of knowledge.\n Processing Information to Extract Meaning  Critically, directing attention at a lower or “shallow” level of processing (e.g., focusing on the orthography of words while reading) disrupts higher or “deeper” levels of processing (e.g., determining what those words mean). As a result, the type of processing in which one consciously engages determines what information will be encoded into memory and retained. The type of processing is more important than the intent to learn (e.g., Craik \u0026amp; Tulving, 1975); the implication is that a student who deliberately prepares for a test but who does not engage in deep processing will not do as well as the student who processes the material deeply, even if the latter student is not deliberately trying to learn the material.\n  One helpful distinction involves item- specific processing versus relational processing (Hunt \u0026amp; Einstein, 1981). Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.\nIn contrast, relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other. In short, both item-specific and relational processing can involve meaning extraction, but they direct the learner to different aspects of the to-be- remembered events.\n Importance of Match Between Processing at Encoding and Retrieval  Rather, memory performance is the joint product of the way in which the memory was encoded (i.e., the memory trace that is stored) and the way in which it is retrieved (i.e., the cues provided) (e.g., Tulving \u0026amp; Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving \u0026amp; Osler, 1968). This idea is codified in the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, which states that memory performance will be enhanced to the extent that the processes engaged during initial learning match the processes required for the criterial task\n  In short, there is not always a single right answer about which study strategy will be best. Rather, as reflected in ideas about transfer-appropriate processing, the ideal study strategy depends upon what the student will need to do later.\n Summary  We have presented three general cognitive principles that are critical for determining memory performance in educational settings:\n introducing desirable difficulties during learning engaging in processes that emphasize meaning extraction and matching learning processes to the processes needed to excel on the final criterial task (i.e., transfer-appropriate processing).   Learning Strategies for Studying Material Receiving Advance Organizers Highlighting and Underlining Note Taking  Although note taking yields memorial benefits, the type of notes naturally taken may not be the most powerful mnemonic possible. One issue involves how much note taking involves going beyond the to-be-remembered information (versus simply copying; see Marsh \u0026amp; Sink, 2010), including paraphrasing the to-be-remembered information and connecting it to stored knowledge. Returning to the levels of processing framework, the key issue is the depth of processing note taking naturally affords. We have just reviewed evidence that note taking encourages relational processing that affords transfer. Nevertheless, additional benefit may come from techniques that encourage the reader or listener to process the material even more deeply. For example, King (1992) trained students to summarize material, specifically how to identify and encapsulate the main idea. This group of students was compared to another group who took notes naturally, and who later had a chance to review those notes. Students who summarized the lecture performed better on both immediate and delayed comprehension tests than students who took notes (see Bretzing \u0026amp; Kulhavy, 1979, for similar results). Similarly, the note-taking group did not do as well as a group of students trained to ask themselves (and answer) questions about the material. Students might benefit from incorporating some of these deep processing techniques into their notes; in other words, training might help students to take notes that include more of the generative processing thought to be key for transfer (e.g., Peper \u0026amp; Mayer, 1978).\n Learning Strategies for Poststudy Retrieval Practice  \u0026hellip; memory research has shown that retrieving information from memory actually changes memory (e.g., Bjork, 1975), improving long-term retention of the material\n  The finding that retrieval practice produces superior long-term retention has been termed the testing effect\n  When testing is used as a learning tool in educational settings, there are several ways in which its efficacy can be enhanced.\n Tests that require students to produce a response, such as short-answer and essay tests, generally lead to better retention than tests that simply require the selection of the correct response, such as multiple-choice tests and true/false tests. Taking multiple tests results in better retention than taking a single test, so it is beneficial to repeat questions on quizzes and give cumulative exams. Successful retrieval is the key to learning from tests, so providing feedback after the test is essential, especially if test-takers do not retrieve many correct responses  (paraphrased)\n Processing Feedback to Correct Errors  The most consistent result is that providing learners with the correct answer in the feedback message produces better subsequent performance than simply indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect (e.g., Pashler et al., 2005; for a meta-analysis, see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, \u0026amp; Morgan, 1991). This finding makes sense because informing the learner that a given response is incorrect will not help the learner to correct the error if the learner does not have any recourse to learn the correct answer.\n Spacing Out Practice Over Time  \u0026hellip; [I]t seems that the optimal interval depends on how long the knowledge needs to be retained after the last practice (i.e., the retention interval). Cepeda and colleagues (2006; see also Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, \u0026amp; Pashler, 2008) performed a meta-analysis that included 317 experiments from 184 articles on the spacing effect. They found that the optimal spacing interval is approximately 10%–20% of the retention interval. Thus, if the goal is to retain the material for 5 days, then practice should be spaced over intervals between 12 and 24 hours\n Combining Techniques Applying the Guiding Principles and Learning Strategies in Educational Settings Long-Term Learning Learning Beyond Facts  \u0026hellip; [I]n the classroom, educators have many different goals for their students, and these goals vary as a function of the level of education, the type of course, and the time frame given for learning, among many other factors. One way of categorizing these goals is through Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives, which conceptualizes learning as a hierarchy in which the various levels must be mastered in sequential order. The cognitive domain is comprised of six levels (from lowest to highest):\n knowledge (e.g., learning facts, concepts, etc.) comprehension (e.g., understanding the relationship between ideas) application (e.g., using knowledge to solve new problems) analysis (e.g., finding evidence to support a hypothesis) synthesis (e.g., combining different accounts of an event to understand what occurred) evaluation (e.g., assessing the validity of an idea according to certain criteria)   Permastore\nThe Relativity of Memory ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/memory_in_educational_settings/","summary":"Summary  Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is a desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.  One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.   The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.","title":"Memory in Educational Settings"},{"content":" Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards.

You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\ncrdrost\n  Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulty\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that learning something, forgetting it and then struggling to learn it again leads to faster learning times. It may be that struggle is inherent in the process of learning something complex. If you equate struggle with pain, then I think it makes some sense.\nmikekchar\n  In my ~20 years of experience, the only way to get good at something that is incredibly complex like kernel development, you will need to actually try to build the thing. Over and over and over.\nbob1029\n  In the language learning example, Extensive Reading leads to not only picking up and remembering words, but also collocations, grammar and even cultural beliefs of the speakers of the target language. Single word flash cards miss all of that. Full sentence flashcards do a bit better but still fall short.\nI think the best use for SRS for something like a language or programming is for laying down a scaffold in the very early stages of learning, and then moving to more productive uses of study time as soon as possible.\nAlchemistCamp, replying to stared\n This raises an important point in the use of spaced repetition systems (SRS). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words. Spaced repetition systems lend themselves easily to the study of small chunks of information (eg: definitions) but it is more difficult to apply them to higher-level applications of knowledge and understanding (eg: essay writing).\n I think semantic tree/first principles/physics-based approach (popularly attributed to Elon Musk) is one way to approach it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a really difficult approach and you need a certain level of intelligence and personality to do it well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. I can do it to some extent but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really difficult to hold lots of ideas in tension and to be questioning all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s just not my thinking style.\nThe other approach is what many smart (but non-geniuses) take: the buffet approach. You graze at the table of books, Wikipedia, online articles, and hang out in online communities (like Twitter) to overhear what experts are discussing. The thing about most areas of knowledge is, there\u0026rsquo;s usually only 20% of the subject that matters\u0026ndash;the rest rarely come up (Pareto Principle). To know what 20% to focus on, you need to understand the sociology of the subject matter and what experts think are important. Unlike the previous approach, you won\u0026rsquo;t have watershed-level insights, but you\u0026rsquo;ll know enough to be considered \u0026ldquo;educated\u0026rdquo; on the subject.\nwenc\n Thoughts Relevant: How to Read a Paper\n","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/ask_hn_how_do_you_learn_complex_dense_technical_information/","summary":"Notes  Essentially I think learning is fundamentally Pain.

","title":"Three Components of Emotion"},{"content":"A Potter\u0026rsquo;s Workbook Skeleton Contents Acknowledgments Truth to Process  As an apprentice at the Leach Pottery in 1964 and 1965, I helped produce a line of standard ware shapes. I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.\n Wondrous The Space Within  The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.\n  The task was to make a cylinder. The word \u0026ldquo;pot\u0026rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.\n Beginnings and Endings  The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.\n  The variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.\n Cylinders as Pots  The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.\n  Of particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.\n  The cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).\n Figure 44\nPitchers  It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.\n  A useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.\n  If you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.\n Bowls  Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.\n Pots with Lids Learning to See Style and Voice Utility and Tradition Place Notes ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/a_potter_s_workbook/","summary":"A Potter\u0026rsquo;s Workbook Skeleton Contents Acknowledgments Truth to Process  As an apprentice at the Leach Pottery in 1964 and 1965, I helped produce a line of standard ware shapes.

He’s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of “lotus-eaters”. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.\n The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.\nValentine wrote a follow-up review in which he emphasized the specific claims he made in his original article:\n  External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are lotuses.) It\u0026rsquo;s possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can notice the taste of lotuses.) It\u0026rsquo;s good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned with others' goals regardless of how they relate to our own. If you notice this, you\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself wanting to spit out lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.  Valentine\n I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims. Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There\u0026rsquo;s a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio, for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories, throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It\u0026rsquo;s not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I\u0026rsquo;ve realigned my goals around the game and that those new goals won\u0026rsquo;t take me where I want to go.\n","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/noticing_the_taste_of_lotus/","summary":"Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about “lotus-eating”.

My guess is that here, as with the calculus test, the main problem is that most courses of action are extremely ineffective, and that there has been no strong evolutionary or cultural force sufficient to focus us on the very narrow behavior patterns that would actually be effective.\nTo be more specific: there are clearly at least some limited senses in which we have goals. We: (1) tell ourselves and others stories of how we’re aiming for various “goals”; (2) search out modes of activity that are consistent with the role, and goal-seeking, that we see ourselves as doing (“learning math”; “becoming a comedian”; “being a good parent”); and sometimes even (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do/don’t achieve our “goals”.\nBut there are clearly also heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement (or that would be part of what it means to “have goals” at all) that we do not automatically carry out. We do not automatically:\n(a) Ask ourselves what we’re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (“what does it look like to be a good comedian?”) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven’t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren’t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don’t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that isn’t going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our \u0026ldquo;goal\u0026rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won\u0026rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting; \u0026hellip;. or carry out any number of other useful techniques. Instead, we mostly just do things. We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal. We do any number of things. But we do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions that would effectively optimize for our claimed goals, or for any other goals.\n ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/humans_are_not_automatically_strategic/","summary":"Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test?

The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat. The course is delivered in small groups facilitated by a trained instructor. Participants receive reading materials on Dr. John Sarno’s and Dr. Howard Schubiner’s work to study during the intervention period. The educational sessions are focused on the relationship between psychological stress and pain and are divided in four components according to their content:\n Component 1: Psycophysiologic Pain Education  The mainstay of this component is for the participants to recognize their symptoms as a part of a psychophysiologic mind-body syndrome, as opposed to an exclusively physical etiology. This recognition is accomplished by exploring the history of their pain, identifying “inconsistencies” in the physical components of their pain (discrepancies in symptom localization and/or temporal occurrence), and acquiring information on the nature of nonspecific chronic back pain itself. Great focus is placed on the role of the relationship of underlying psychological stressors to physical pain. As participants are encouraged to examine the origin of the pain, they notice patterns in the experience of their pain that reflect the contribution of psychological and stress-related factors (e.g. e xperiencing severe back pain when driving but only when in heavy traffic, pain that occurs with sitting but not when sitting on a chairlift during recreational skiing, pain that is worse while walking into the workplace but fine when walking upon exiting). Hereby, participants gain awareness of the connection between pain and psychological processes and a better understanding of the variety of potentially modifiable factors that contribute to chronic back pain.\nExamples:\nIn the above example of an inconsistency, a participant complaining about back pain when driving, was able to identify that he was experiencing pain only while driving on busy roads and not on less busy roads. As a next step, the participant was able to recognize both the role of stress and the underlying emotion of anger that occurred when driving on a busy road. As the participant became able to recognize the feeling of anger in this situation, his pain during driving dissipated. This, in turn, provided insight into his pain in other circumstances and his overall pain resolved over time in conjunction with the other components of this program.\nAnother participant experienced pain while sitting, yet upon reflection, she recognized there were times when sitting did not cause pain such as when she was knitting (an activity she loved to do and which she found relaxing). During the course of this program, she was able to recognize this “inconsistency” as well as others and worked on desensitization (see component II). Additionally, she was able to realize that she put tremendous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother and wife. As she learned to be more accepting of herself, her unrealistic expectations of herself were reduced as was her pain experience.\n Component 2: Desensitization and Returning to Physical Activity  One of the main contributors hypothesized to contribute to chronic pain derived from psychophysiologic causes is that pain becomes a conditioned response to a physical trigger. According to the classical conditioning model, previously neutral stimuli can become linked to the pain experience. Thus, without the need for a current nociceptive input, this association can be coupled with physical reactions ultimately leading to pain. For example, formerly elicited pain-induced muscle tensions can become associated with other stimuli like sitting or walking and lead to fear and avoidance of these positions/movements. This association can result in fear of recreating pain and thus avoidance of these movements Therefore, one of the key components of our therapy program is to “desensitize” the participants and break the cycle of pain. In order to achieve this goal, multiple desensitization techniques are utilized in this phase.\nVisual motor imagery (mental simulation of a painful situation) is a desensitization technique during which the participant is asked to first visualize a movement where pain typically occurs. Often (though not universally) the visualization will bring on pain. When this occurs, this serves to help the participant recognize that the pain can be elicited simply in his or her mind without any physical movement. This concept helps support the fact that the pain is psychophysiologic in nature. Next, the person is encouraged to repeatedly visualize the movement which caused pain while they are repeating self-soothing statements. With these repeated visualizations (without physical movement), the pain can ultimately wane and cannot be reproduced using visualization alone. When this process is complete (and pain can no longer be elicited), the patient can then proceed with slowly undertaking the actual movements/positions (see example below).\nAdditionally, identifying conditioned responses in daily life is a crucial part of this phase. For example, if sitting were a trigger, one would sit with the knowledge that the pain associated with sitting is a conditioned response and not actually related to some physical injury or component of sitting. Over time, the pain will dissipate, and the conditioning will be effectively reversed, allowing the participant to return to full physical activity. By returning to previous physical activity, patients also reinforce the “knowledge therapy” component as they begin to recognize that pain is not actually related to physical triggers per se, but rather psychological triggers. The safety of participants during this process is ensured through the gradual increase of activity under the supervision of a physician (see examples below).\nExample:\nA participant reported having pain with prolonged standing and notably when standing at a bus stop waiting for work. She attributed the pain to the physical activity of prolonged standing. Occasionally, she would return home and miss work because of the severity of the pain. During our program, she first visualized standing at the bus stop, and this reproduced her pain and discomfort. The ability for her to bring on severe pain simply through visualization allowed her to recognize the psychological component of her pain. She then reflected further on the situation from a different perspective and recognized that she was under a great degree of psychological stress while at the bus stop anticipating her day at work. With all this in mind, she first performed visual motor imagery repeatedly over a few days using self-soothing techniques until she reached the point that she could no longer reproduce the pain during visualization. Then, she stood at the bus stop reminding herself that the origin of the pain was not the physical act of standing. Over time, she stood for longer periods of time and the pain decreased despite the overall increase in physical activity. Ultimately, the pain resolved to the point where prolonged standing was no longer a trigger for her pain.\n Component 3: Emotional Expression - Psycology of the Syndrome  Reports on “functional” back pain conditions date back from as early as 1946 (1). The notion that chronic pain may persist as a manifestation of unexpressed negative affective states (e.g. hostility or aggressive impulses that the individual is unwilling or unable to acknowledge) was formulated in 1959 (2). Taking into consideration that some of the contributors to persistent pain include underlying stressful conflicts and aversive affective states, strategies encouraging emotional expression are essential in the treatment of mind-body syndrome. Emotional expression is accomplished through a series of writing exercises and journaling (free writing, cluster writing, letters of forgiveness, gratitude lists), self-reflection, as well as through small group discussion. A recent treatment developed by Drs. Schubiner and Lumley, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), includes similar techniques (3).\nAs an example, a participant realized during the above-mentioned exercises that he was being negatively impacted by the emotional pain caused by the imminent ending of his marriage. As he began to express his emotions, he noticed a significant reduction in his physical pain. Another example noted earlier was a patient who developed severe pain when driving on crowded streets but not on roads without traffic. He ultimately recognized that he was experiencing anger and frustration in a number of specific situations such as being stuck in traffic. This awareness of anger-related contributions to his pain (rather than an exclusively physical explanation that sitting for long periods results in mechanically induced increases in pain) and subsequent expression of those negative emotions helped the patient to improve his pain.\n Component 4: Stress reduction - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  As stress is an underlying component of MBS, the final arm of the program is to engage in stress-reduction techniques. By starting this program with the PSRT portion, participants are often already seeing improvements before embarking on this last portion of the program. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for the prevention and treatment of stress related disorders (4). MBSR has been linked to significant improvements in overall health and well-being, leading to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain (5, 6, 7). MBSR is an 8-week educational program which includes weekly sessions and mindful practice. Students are encouraged to perform daily home practice, which is explored throughout the program. Our MBSR classes adhered to the original protocol of the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. Our mindfulness sessions entail a series of strategies for cultivating present moment awareness - the ability to experience what is arising in the present moment. This allows for the observation of thoughts (past or future), the disengagement from emotional reactivity and the ability to stay with the sensate experience in the body - the outcome of which is a deeper sense of ease, emotional balance and general well-being.\n TODOConvert link to use org-cite  https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9895 https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/ https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html  ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/psychophysiologic_symptom_relief_therapy/","summary":"Psychophysiologic Symptom Relief Therapy (PSRT) is a program for pain relief first?detailed in Donnino et al. and makes use of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction\nComponents of the Psychophysiologic Symptom Relief Therapy (PSRT) program  PSRT is a treatment program designed for patients with non-specific chronic back pain.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.\nNote that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.\nWhy Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.\nI expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment. I chose to attempt a sleep schedule called dual core, which has 5.5 sleeping hours per day, as it was supposed2 to be possible to maintain the schedule indefinitely.\n   Sleep Schedule Hours Awake Per Day Expected Years Left1 Expected Waking Years Left     Monophasic 15 50.4 31.50   Dual Core 1 18.5 50.4 38.85    As the table indicates: sleeping for 3.5 fewer hours daily equates to an increased waking-time life expectancy of 7.35 years. But what would I do with those hours?\nGiven that this was a trial, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time. I expected that I would be exhausted as I adapted to the new sleep schedule.\nThe Trial Sleep Schedule The dual core sleep schedule I attempted was composed of three sleeping times per day.\n   Name Start time End time Duration (hours)     Core 1 22:00 01:30 3.5   Core 2 05:30 07:00 1.5   Nap 13:30 14:00 0.5    I maintained this schedule for 40 days from April 4th, 2021 through June 13th, 2021.\nMeasuring the Impact I opted to do no cognitive tests, etc, during this trial. I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.\nRetrospective How I Felt Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is repartitioning. In short, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases3. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it\u0026rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.\nNonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (531), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I\u0026rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.\nOverall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn\u0026rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I\u0026rsquo;d say that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a negative impact.\nPhysical Symptoms Sleepiness Suprisingly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired \u0026ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.\nDifficulty Waking Up I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (\u0026gt;25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.\n\u0026ldquo;Third Person\u0026rdquo; Feelings Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m watching a TV show right now\u0026rdquo; before the show is over? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.\nI would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; of myself rather than just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.\nHeadaches I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I\u0026rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren\u0026rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.\nSticking to the Schedule Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc4. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using Sleep as Android and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.\nQuality of Sleep I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.\nSleep as Android tracks the duration of \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.\nHow I Seemed to Those Around Me I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she\u0026rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.\nSleep Schedule Going Forward I\u0026rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.\nI had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I\u0026rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there\u0026rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.\nMore and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn\u0026rsquo;t have more to show for it. I\u0026rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours.

To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026quot;\n   Cached Selves by Anna Salamon\nThe idea that my actions are so easily influenced is disconcerting to say the least. The author is writing about commitment and consistency effects with the goal of reducing their effectiveness. I think it would be wise to attempt to incorporate a bit of the author's advice into how I conduct myself. The most straight-forward suggestion is to \u0026quot;[t]ake care never to say anything but what is best supported by the evidence, aloud or to yourself, lest you come to believe it\u0026quot;. Identifying what is supported by the evidence and which evidence is trust-worthy is another can of worms.\n  Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic by Anna Salamon\n We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal.\n   Learned Blankness by Anna Salamon\n Martin Seligman coined the term \u0026quot;learned helplessness\u0026quot; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I\u0026rsquo;ll call this \u0026ldquo;learned blankness\u0026rdquo;. Folks who fall prey to learned blankness may still take actions \u0026ndash; sometimes my students practiced the procedures again and again, hired a tutor, etc. But they do so as though carrying out rituals to an unknown god \u0026ndash; parts of them may be trying, but their \u0026ldquo;understand X\u0026rdquo; center has given up.\n   The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books by Cedric Chin\nI'm not sure if all non-fiction books could be adequately categorized by these three labels. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the vocabulary to describe books I've read that seem like over-stuffed musings on a single idea which would have been better served by a short blog post rather than a book.\n  What is a Career Moat? by Cedric Chin\n A career moat is an individual's ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.\n   The Power of Pomodoros by elharo\n Pomodoros aren\u0026rsquo;t (for me) a means of avoiding procrastination or dividing time among projects. They\u0026rsquo;re a way of blasting through Ugh fields.\n   The Monthly Newsletter as a Thinking Tool by Matt Freeman\nThis post.\n  (a) by Milan Griffes\nI like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that could be automated through some \u0026quot;presubmit\u0026quot; step of the publishing process. I've looked around but haven't found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links. I expect that I won't bother to include them so long as I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain content will be present and determined readers will be able to consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.\nI also notice that the author includes (sometimes long) relevant quotes from links they cite, or even a long quote and nothing else. I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the goal of \u0026quot;(a)\u0026quot;.\n  Meaningful Rest by Neel Nanda\n An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, these lists are basically disjoint!\n  Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower. (I elaborate far more on this model in this post)\n   Productivity by Sam Altman\nThere is a lot of good advice in here. I especially appreciated the point about avoiding productivity porn. \u0026quot;Chasing productivity for its own sake isn't helpful\u0026quot;. I've done that chase before and at best it's a time sink and at worst it's a form of self-deception. As such, I want to be sure to do more than just read the article and then proceed with my life as it was before. I've had more success integrating change gradually and building on small accomplishments as opposed to attempting to overhaul all of my habits at once. I'll try to tackle one piece of advice weekly, of my own highlights from the article, and attempt to work it into my life that week.\n  Noticing the Taste of Lotus by Valentine\nThe idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention. The importance of, and ways to maintain, focus and attention are a common theme in several other articles recently (at least recent to me and my discovery of them).\nThe author's follow-up review of their own writing distinguishes a few claims made in the piece:\n   External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are lotuses.)\n  It's possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can notice the taste of lotuses.)\n  It's good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned with others' goals regardless of how they relate to our own.\n  If you notice this, you'll find yourself wanting to spit out lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.\n   I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims. Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There's a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio, for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories, throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It's not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it's a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I've realigned my goals around the game and that those new goals won't take me where I want to go.\n  Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software Developer by Zachary Betz\nI think the author makes a good point. Perhaps I'm less interested than others would be as I've seen these ideas already expressed by Cal Newport.\n  Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger) by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo;; naru is \u0026ldquo;becoming,\u0026rdquo; and the form naritai is \u0026ldquo;want to become.\u0026rdquo; Together it means, \u0026ldquo;I want to become stronger,\u0026rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I\u0026rsquo;ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player\u0026mdash;or after you lose an important match, but you haven\u0026rsquo;t given up\u0026mdash;or after you win an important match, but you\u0026rsquo;re not a ninth-dan player yet\u0026mdash;or after you\u0026rsquo;ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence\n   Something to Protect by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.\n   Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now by Alexy Guzey\n This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing not only helps you to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.\n   Making Yourself Small by Helen\n .. probably the most important thing is your mental/emotional state - a friend suggested \u0026ldquo;not wanting to startle a small bird\u0026rdquo; as an mindset to inhabit, to encourage yourself to become \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo;.\n   Seeing the Smoke by Jacob Falkovich\n As Eliezer reminded us, most people sitting alone in a room will quickly get out if it starts filling up with smoke. But if two other people in the room seem unperturbed, almost everyone will stay put. That is the result of a famous experiment from the 1960s and its replications \u0026mdash; people will sit and nervously look around at their peers for 20 minutes even as thick smoke starts obscuring their vision.\n  In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?\nExponential growth is hard for people to grasp. Most people answer \u0026lsquo;24\u0026rsquo; to the above question, or something random like \u0026lsquo;35\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive to people that the lily pads could be barely noticeable on day 44 and yet completely cover the lake on day 48.\n   Be Impatient by Ben Kuhn\n Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n   Attention is your scarcest resource by Ben Kuhn\n \u0026quot;The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:\n\u0026lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.\n10-50% focus: \u0026ldquo;meets expectations,\u0026rdquo; gets regular raises.\n50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.\u0026quot;\nByrne Hobart\n\u0026quot;50%+ focus\u0026quot; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start habitually asking \u0026quot;how could this go faster?\u0026quot; It\u0026rsquo;s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time\u0026mdash;or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/links/","summary":"Links 2021 May   Theory of Change by Aaron Swartz\n A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action \u0026mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it.

I\u0026rsquo;ll write a follow-up, or amend this post, with the relevant source code at some point.\nI started tracking my time a few months ago so I could have data to back up questions about how much I time I was giving to studying, working, cooking, chores, friends, etc. The solutions I found for tracking personal time didn\u0026rsquo;t mesh with the way I wanted to track time:\n Interface The UI should be intuitive and simple; after all, there are only a handful of actions I care about. Privacy 1 and Access My data should remain mine and mine alone, accessible whenever I want. Some of the things I track are personal, or at least would give someone else a bit too much insight into my time for my liking. Granularity I want to be able to track things down to the minute. Portability I need to be able to track time wherever I am. The ideal solution would be on my phone or watch.  I ended up implementing my own solution which combines Tasker as a front-end on my Android phone with Google Calendar as a back-end.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve exposed three functions through Tasker (in order from left to right):\n Time Track: Start Opens a category menu and starts tracking time for the selected category. Notify Queries the calendar and displays the sum length of all events, grouped by category, which ended today between 00:00 and 23:59. This does not include the current time tracking duration. Time Track: Stop Stops tracking time; creates an event in the calendar.  Clicking the first button opens a menu which lists time tracking categories I\u0026rsquo;ve used before. I can also add a new category, by entering the new category name into the text field in the lower left, or remove an existing category by long-pressing the name.\nThe active time tracking is shown in a notification, which includes the option to move the start time forward or backward in increments of one minute. I\u0026rsquo;ve also included the notification generated by pressing the second button in this image.\nI also have a script which sends me an email every Sunday evening with a daily breakdown and a reminder notification which is triggered after one minutes, then every 15 minutes, when I\u0026rsquo;m not tracking time.\nGoing forward, I\u0026rsquo;d like to analyze the data once I have a solid month or so where I\u0026rsquo;m using the tool regularly.\n  Whether Google Calendar is private is left as an exercise to the reader.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/tracking-time-with-tasker-and-google-calendar/","summary":"In the spirit of personal time tracking, I thought I would share my method as well.
