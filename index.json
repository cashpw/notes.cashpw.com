But I think there\u0026rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:\n You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune You are a maker. You build things for people to use  We self-select into communities of our peers based on these ideals. We use coded language to express these ideals to our peers.\nI think each group has its own conferences, and its own subreddits. Its own programming languages, heroes and its own villains.\n Notes Programming as applied mathematics   Source code: The source should read like poetry - dense, with very few lines of code needed to express an idea. Once understood, the terse program seems like a beautiful and obvious description of your program. It is more important that the source code is simple than the execution is simple or fast. High level languages are better than low level languages because they let you express your intent more clearly. Execution: How the program is executed by the computer is an implementation detail of the compiler. It is more important that the code is simple than the execution is fast. Correctness: A program is correct if it implements the spec exactly. The best programs use tools like Ada to formally prove correctness. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Beautiful code is more important than beautiful UI.     Most (arguably all) of the modern advancements in programming languages come from people in this camp. If you\u0026rsquo;ve used React to make a website, you should know that the model of immutability and expressing your view as a pure function from data to DOM came from functional programming. Actually, most modern language features are invented by people who think of programming as thought. Years (or decades) later, those features get copied into the more popular languages and get treated as new ideas.\n Programming as hardware hacking   Source code: The code should be clean, but clean code is less important than a clean execution. Low level languages are often better than high level languages because you can be more explicit about what the computer will do when it executes your code. (Thus you have more room to optimize). Execution: How the computer executes your code is paramount. Programming without thinking about execution is just begging for slow performance. Correctness: A program is correct if it runs the way you expect it to run, given normal parameters. Execution elegance is more important than correctness. And if a theoretical issue can\u0026rsquo;t happen in practice due to how the machine works, its not a real bug. A program must be adequately fast to be considered correct. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Its ok to let the constraints of the hardware guide the user experience.     To this community we owe almost all performance improvements in our computers, above and beyond what is demanded by customers. Nobody else cares about performance quite like people who think about the hardware all day. But if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about your computer as a machine, what greater ugliness can you inflict than pointless work?\n Programming as a tool to make things   Source code: The code should be clean, but only because cleaner code is easier to iterate on. Code cleanliness is less important than most other considerations. Execution: The program only has to be fast enough for the users. If you make it even faster, you\u0026rsquo;re taking time away from adding features that people care about more. Correctness: Bugs are bad only in proportion to their impact. The program should act the way the users expect it to act. UI: The UI is more important than anything else. Every other part of the program only exists in service to the user interface.     I think most professional software engineers are in this tribe - which makes sense, because this is the place where it is easiest to make money writing software.\nIn my experience people in this camp are better at community. They seem to be much more positive and encouraging of new members, and willing to help. I guess its because you can tell if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job in the other two camps by simply taking a look yourself. If you make software for other humans, satisfaction comes from making the people around you happy.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel that this place is a touch soulless. Taken to the extreme, this world view doesn\u0026rsquo;t value the beauty in the engineering itself. Although you could probably make the opposite criticism against the other groups - they don\u0026rsquo;t value how their software can impact the world.\n Also see Moloch.\n.csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Gentle, Joseph. 2017. “3 Tribes of Programming.” Seph. http://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/.

Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?\nMoloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis' question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it?

Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.\nSo you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don\u0026rsquo;t everyone else will kill you, because if they don\u0026rsquo;t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to \u0026ldquo;everyone agrees to stop doing this at once\u0026rdquo;, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.\n Examples Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma Fish farming story  As a thought experiment, let\u0026rsquo;s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.\nBut each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let\u0026rsquo;s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.\nA thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.\nBut one farmer (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.\nEveryone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he\u0026rsquo;s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.\nOnce four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying \u0026ldquo;Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone\u0026rsquo;s productivity goes down.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…\nA self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.\n Malthusian trap  Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you\u0026rsquo;re one of those rats from The Rats of NIMHhttps://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=slastacod-20\u0026amp;l=as2\u0026amp;o=1\u0026amp;a=0689710682).\nYou live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there\u0026rsquo;s not enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.\nA certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back will go extinct within a few generations.\nIn fact, it\u0026rsquo;s not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out, swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.\nIf some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island\u0026rsquo;s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop the cycle will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating anything is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.\nFor a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.\n Capitalism  Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can\u0026rsquo;t, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\n Two-income trap  It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.\nFrom a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get one will be left behind.\n Agriculture II  A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t take it die out. Eventually, everyone\u0026rsquo;s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone\u0026rsquo;s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.\n III  But not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move uphill surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons – excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization – plus one good reason – coordination.\n   I know that \u0026ldquo;capitalists sometimes do bad things\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it\u0026rsquo;s not equivalent to \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo;. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they\u0026rsquo;re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter.\n(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very well and people who summarize him as \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo; are doing him a disservice)\n   For example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling to do anything about them because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to look \u0026ldquo;soft on crime\u0026rdquo;, and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all over the airwaves as \u0026ldquo;Convict released by Congressman\u0026rsquo;s policies kills family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone claim he deserves reelection?\u0026rdquo;. So even if decreasing prison populations would be good policy – and it is – it will be very difficult to implement.\n(Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the stunned governments!)\n   [\u0026hellip;] government can easily solve the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races within a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.\nThe two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there\u0026rsquo;s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.\n IV  So I agree with Robin Hanson: This is the dream time. This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and science and philosophy and love can flourish.\nAs technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus' unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.\n Contract Drafting Em\n The last value we have to sacrifice is being anything at all, having the lights on inside. With sufficient technology we will be \u0026ldquo;able\u0026rdquo; to give up even the final spark.\n(Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!)\nEverything the human race has worked for – all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future – might be accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.\n(Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!)\n   We will break our back lifting Moloch to Heaven, but unless something changes it will be his victory and not ours.\n VII  The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.\nAnd the whole point of Bostrom\u0026rsquo;s Superintelligence is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift something to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u0026rsquo;s on our side, it can kill Moloch dead.\nAnd if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to flourish unconstrained by natural law.\n VIII  The Universe is a dark and foreboding place, suspended between alien deities. Cthulhu, Gnon, Moloch, call them what you will.\nSomewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names. In the Kushiel books, his name was Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans.\nThe other gods sit on their dark thrones and think \u0026ldquo;Ha ha, a god who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!\u0026rdquo;\nBut somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a surprising number of unfortunate accidents.\nThere are many gods, but this one is ours.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?\nMy answer is: Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.\nHe always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.\nAs long as the offer\u0026rsquo;s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2014. “Meditations On Moloch.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/.

This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to go into every gruesome detail, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to couch your answer at the level you think they\u0026rsquo;ll understand and that you have time for, but they\u0026rsquo;re smarter than you probably think.\n Win the series  Every interaction is a repeated game, and your goal is not to win this one iteration, but to win the series. So if a child is crying because she wants something, even though it feels like a win to give in now (she stops crying which is better for everyone, you haven\u0026rsquo;t really given up much), it\u0026rsquo;s disastrous in the repeated game because she learns that she can get what she wants by crying.\n Never bluff  If you threaten a consequence and don\u0026rsquo;t follow through, they\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out really quickly. Which leads to the following rule: be very careful with threats. If you make them, carry them out; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to carry out the threat, don\u0026rsquo;t make it.\n Praise the process  We\u0026rsquo;re pretty particular in how we praise our kids. We try to use process praise (\u0026ldquo;I like the way you made up a story about all the parts of your drawing\u0026rdquo;), some amount of results praise (\u0026ldquo;That block tower is amazing!

Not because I\u0026rsquo;ve set out to teach them that stuff, but because they ask lots of questions and I try to answer them.

For instance, Greenwald mentioned a scene in a hospital in which a nurse inflating a blood-pressure cuff originally said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to blow this up.\u0026rdquo; Greenwald recalls: \u0026ldquo;Fred made us redub the line, saying, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to puff this up with some air,\u0026rsquo; because \u0026lsquo;blow it up\u0026rsquo; might sound like there\u0026rsquo;s an explosion, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.\u0026rdquo;\nThe show\u0026rsquo;s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn\u0026rsquo;t air. And Rogers\u0026rsquo;s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet \u0026ldquo;to sleep,\u0026rdquo; he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.\nRogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children\u0026rsquo;s minds might go. For instance, in a scene in which an eye doctor uses an ophthalmoscope to peer into his eyes, he made a point of having the doctor clarify that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see Rogers\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. Rogers also wrote a song called \u0026ldquo;You Can Never Go Down the Drain,\u0026rdquo; because he knew that drains were something that, to kids, seemed to exist solely to suck things down.\n(King 2018)\n   In 1977, about a decade into the show\u0026rsquo;s run, Arthur Greenwald and another writer named Barry Head cracked open a bottle of scotch while on a break, and coined the term Freddish. They later created an illustrated manual called \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Talk About Freddish,\u0026rdquo; a loving parody of the demanding process of getting all the words just right for Rogers. \u0026ldquo;What Fred understood and was very direct and articulate about was that the inner life of children was deadly serious to them,\u0026rdquo; Greenwald said.\nPer the pamphlet, there were nine steps for translating into Freddish:\n \u0026ldquo;State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms preschoolers can understand.\u0026rdquo; Example: It is dangerous to play in the street. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase in a positive manner,\u0026rdquo; as in It is good to play where it is safe. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.\u0026rdquo; As in, \u0026ldquo;Ask your parents where it is safe to play.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive.\u0026rdquo; In the example, that\u0026rsquo;d mean getting rid of \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo;: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;d be \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo;: Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.\u0026rdquo; Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow your advice.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; represents a value judgment, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea a ﬁnal time, relating it to some phase of development a preschooler can understand.\u0026rdquo; Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play.

The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.\nBlack proposes converting work to play. I wonder: will all games have players?\n Even if we assume that all work could be gamified, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that everyone will want to play such games. I love games, and have spent way too much of my life playing them, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gone months and years without playing any games at all, and don\u0026rsquo;t see how being forced to play a game would be any better than being forced to work.\nAlso, its difficult to imagine how the most undesirable of jobs could be gamified. Who\u0026rsquo;s going to want to play the garbageman game? Or the fix the sewage system game?\nThe products and services of our modern world also requires sustained, multi-year efforts by trained specialists. Something like the mass production of medicine isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can just play with once in a while and still get it made in high enough quantities with serious quality control.\n(pmoriarty n.d.)\n Perhaps the answer is just more automation.\nNotes  The alternative to work isn\u0026rsquo;t just idleness. To be ludic is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it\u0026rsquo;s never more rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called \u0026ldquo;leisure\u0026rdquo;; far from it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.\n The Carrot is the Stick\n Many workers are fed up with work. There are high and rising rates of absenteeism, turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread among workers themselves is that work itself is inevitable and necessary.\nI disagree. It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand — and I think this is the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure — we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make them less enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.\n   Under a system of permanent revelry, we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put the Renaissance to shame. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any more jobs, just things to do and people to do them.\n   Bear in mind that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take today\u0026rsquo;s work just as we find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would have to be perverse indeed. If technology has a role in all this it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new realms for re/creation.\n   Workers of the world\u0026hellip; relax!\n   Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren\u0026rsquo;t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.\nAnd so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Black, Bob. n.d. “The Abolition of Work.” The Anarchist Library.

A substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too expensive. Chicken is a substitute for beef. If you\u0026rsquo;re a chicken farmer and the price of beef goes up, the people will want more chicken, and you will sell more.\nA complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems. And babysitters are a complement of dinner at fine restaurants.\n(Spolsky 2002)\n   All else being equal, demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease.\n(Spolsky 2002)\n   Any product is the joint outcome of a large number of individual components, each of which layers is necessary but not sufficient to the final valuable use of the entire stack put together; a smartphone is not much good without a power-efficient sensitive radio, but the radio is not much good without a good OS on top of it, and a good OS is not much good either without great apps like web browsers (and is a web browser all that useful if there aren\u0026rsquo;t useful websites to use in it, and where are the languages \u0026amp; compilers for all this coming from anyway…?).\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Another way that I like to express that is \u0026ldquo;create a desert of profitability around you\u0026rdquo;. I once had a strategy professor define the Google business model somewhat like that, where \u0026ldquo;Google tries to make every other business around it free or irrelevant\u0026rdquo;…A desert of profitability shifts consumers to you, and keeps competitors away.\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Vertical integration can be an effective way of resolving the intractable market dispute with top-down dictatorships, but can require lax anti-monopoly regulations, high capital investment, massive corporation overextension \u0026amp; empire-building, and risks being outcompeted at every level by nimbler competitors; this makes it difficult for any up-and-coming company to implement, and often ineffective. Commoditizing the complements, in contrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small \u0026amp; lean, can often be accomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual property or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific layers without the \u0026ldquo;Big Bang\u0026rdquo; orientation of vertical integration and permitting \u0026ldquo;defeat in detail\u0026rdquo;, retains the general facade of competition, and ensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack where the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but is not itself at any risk.\nIn practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market dynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging competitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits \u0026amp; software patent trolling, proprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate incompatibility or \u0026ldquo;embrace and extend\u0026rdquo;, FUD, operating at a loss indefinitely, etc. (\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s An App For That\u0026rdquo; is why you buy an iPhone—but it\u0026rsquo;s Apple with the $930 billion market cap \u0026amp; not the app developers.)\nDone correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents' long-term control of markets \u0026amp; justifies their enormous valuations—by definition, the competitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too numerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening R\u0026amp;D4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be relatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor does this require convoluted explanations like \u0026ldquo;they are pretending to not be monopolists\u0026rdquo; or fully general unfalsifiable claims like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s good PR\u0026rdquo; for why big companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects like new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts \u0026amp; TrueType itself) or open source TCP/​IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly profitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable—but do have clear explanations in terms of business objectives like \u0026ldquo;driving more mobile web browsing\u0026rdquo; (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement, mobile web browsing, has become cheaper/​easier). I wonder if this also explains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes—as entities get worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but was formerly considered \u0026lsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; or because they assume the other entity knows something they don\u0026rsquo;t. (Google cared little about an also-ran code-hosting site like GitLab other than some VC investment—well, right up until Microsoft outbid it for Github \u0026amp; Github became free for individual developers \u0026amp; acquired NPM⁠, and then suddenly GitLab becomes a unicorn with even more VC from Google \u0026amp; others.)\n(Branwen 2018)\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Branwen, Gwern. 2018. “Laws of Tech: Commoditize Your Complement,” March. https://www.gwern.net/Complement.

Since one of those choices was the CompUSA around the block from us, my co-worker brought it there. And waited. And waited. And was told they were waiting for the part. We called the Apple store who said that they could do most repairs in 24 hours. The question was, \u0026ldquo;How do we get it back?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to a CompUSA on the east-coast, you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realize that they are PC-centric and the Macs are nearly non-existent. We only brought it there because it was so close and, gosh, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Apple have some way to certify that a CompUSA has qualified repair people and a good stash of spares before it would list that particular location? I mean, this is Apple, right? The best quality around? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that quality extend to their partners?\nSo my co-worker went to the CompUSA and asked if the repair was done. The guy went to the back room, then came out. \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case, I want it back.\u0026rdquo;\nThe repair person got very defensive. \u0026ldquo;Why do you want it back? It\u0026rsquo;s not working! What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\nMy co-worker, in a shining moment of brilliance realized that any kind of full disclosure would only result in an unproductive battle over the iMac that he could easily lose: possession is 9/10th of the law.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s taking too long\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d have to defend the assertion against a barrage of, \u0026ldquo;But we promise it will be only one more day\u0026rdquo; and other excuses.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m taking it to your competitor\u0026rdquo; then he\u0026rsquo;d have to suffer through someone defending his company\u0026rsquo;s honor (and profits) to defeat the request.\nBeing too honest wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help either. Saying \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re incompetent and I want to take it somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help the situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no cheese down that hole.\nThen he came up with the perfect answer: He shrugged his shoulders and said, \u0026ldquo;My boss wants it back.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the perfect answer. You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with it.\nIt can be said that the most effective communication is that that speaks in the audience\u0026rsquo;s terms. His answer said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a lacky just like you. Your boss is a jerk and gives you shit jobs to do, and I my boss is a jerk and gives me shit jobs. I\u0026rsquo;m just like you. Please, in the brotherhood of underpaid-lackeys-with-mean-bosses, just give it to me.\u0026rdquo;\nIt harkening back to mommy and daddy leaving you speechless as a child being told \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t have that candy because I said so\u0026rdquo; it disarms him. It turns the biggest repair shop bully into a crying, defenseless child.\nIt ends the argument because it says, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with me, I\u0026rsquo;m the messenger.\u0026rdquo;\nThe name for this technique is \u0026ldquo;playing dumb.\u0026rdquo; It is a technique that we geeks often forget.

As it\u0026rsquo;s been said elsewhere, they \u0026ldquo;beg for the bad news.\u0026rdquo;\n Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived  Being able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multi-threaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes. Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and ego-boosting behavior send the message to other engineers (maybe tacitly) to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things. An engineer who is quick to call someone a moron is someone destined to stunt his or her career.\nThis also means that mature engineers have self-awareness when it comes to their communication. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer communicates perfectly, only that they have some notion about where they could be better, and continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how they\u0026rsquo;re doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it elsewhere, but I must emphasize the point more: the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.\n Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it  Avoiding responsibility for estimates is another way of saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure.\u0026rdquo; All businesses rely on estimates, and all engineers working on a project are involved in Joint Activity, which means that they have a responsibility to others to make themselves interpredictable. In general, mature engineers are comfortable with working within some nonzero amount of uncertainty and risk.\n Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know they do  This code looks good, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked other people to review it, and I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their feedback. Now: how long will it last before it\u0026rsquo;s rewritten? Once it\u0026rsquo;s in production, how will its execution affect resource usage? How much do I expect CPU/memory/disk/network to increase or decrease? Will others be able to understand this code? Am I making it as easy as I can for others to extend or introspect this work?\n Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work  Getting things done means doing things you might not be interested in. No matter how exciting or appealing a project is, there are always boring tasks. Tedious tasks. Tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title.\n Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them  They recognize that at some point, their individual contribution and potential cannot be exercised singularly. They recognize that there is only so much that can be produced by a single person, and the world\u0026rsquo;s best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers.\n Mature engineers understand the difference between mentorship and sponsorship, and develop a habit of the latter Allspaw distinguishes between \u0026ldquo;mentorship\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sponsorship\u0026rdquo;:\n Mentors Face Inward Sponsors Face Outward   Engineers who find that the visibility of their own work is increasing acknowledge that a fundamental of wielding influence in your local community (both inside and outside your organization) is developing and maintaining awareness of opportunities to sponsor those around them that would benefit. It is not a secret that the tech industry is seriously challenged when it comes to supporting underrepresented and/or marginalized groups.\nDeveloping this as a habit takes effort, but the benefits are multi-fold; the engineer sharpens their critical-thinking skills (\u0026ldquo;oh, what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about in this meeting would be a great opportunity for $NAME to work on…\u0026quot;) and the sponsored engineer has opportunities that they otherwise might not.\n   [\u0026hellip;] this instinct to mentor plays into the idea that those who are marginalized aren\u0026rsquo;t already skilled enough, smart enough, or ready for more responsibility or leadership.\nWhat members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice. They have to work extremely hard and be extremely good at what they do to combat the systemic privilege and unconscious bias at play in our work environments. They are consistently under-promoted and under-compensated for this work, even though it\u0026rsquo;s excellent work.\n Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions  They realize all engineering decisions, implementations, and designs exist within a spectrum; we do not live in a binary world. They can quickly point out contexts where one successful approach or solution could work and where it could not. They know that one cannot be both efficient and thorough at the same time (The ETTO Principle), that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.\nThey know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and are OK with that. They are comfortable with it because they strive to make the ideal and non-ideal in a design explicit. Later on in the lifecycle of a design, when the original design is not scaling anymore or needs to be replaced or rewritten, they can look back not with a perspective of how short-sighted those earlier decisions were, but instead say \u0026ldquo;yep, we made it this far with it and knew we\u0026rsquo;d have to extend or change it at some point. Looks like that time is now, let\u0026rsquo;s get to work!\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;]\n   The tl;dr on trade-offs is that everyone cuts corners, in every project. Immature engineers discover them in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them and recognize them as part of good engineering.\n Mature engineers don\u0026rsquo;t practice CYAE (\u0026ldquo;Cover Your Ass Engineering\u0026rdquo;)  An example of CYAE is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not my fault. They broke it, they used it wrong. I built it to spec, I can\u0026rsquo;t be held responsible for their mistakes or improper specification.\u0026rdquo;\n I disagree with this point. I consider a lot of the documentation and design work that a mature engineer does to be under the heading of CYA. I agree that mature engineers won\u0026rsquo;t seek to throw others under the bus. However, I also expect mature engineers to understand that others may not play by the same rules. I expect a mature engineer to, at least to some extent, play the game.\nMature engineers are empathetic  In complex projects, there are usually a number of stakeholders. In any project, the designers, product managers, operations engineers, developers, and business development folks all have goals and perspectives, and mature engineers realize that those goals and views may be different. They understand this so that they can navigate effectively in the work that they do. Being empathetic in this sense means having the ability to view the project from another person\u0026rsquo;s perspective and to take that into consideration into your own work.\n Mature engineers make grounded complaints  [\u0026hellip;] they express judgments based on empirical evidence and bring with those judgments options for solving the problem which they\u0026rsquo;ve identified. A great manager of mine said to never go to your boss with a complaint about anything without at least one (ideally more than one) suggestion for a solution. Even demonstrating that you\u0026rsquo;ve tried working the problem on your own and came up empty-handed is better than an empty complaint.\n Mature engineers are aware of cognitive biases  This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer needs to have a degree in psychology, but cognitive biases are what can limit the growth of an engineer\u0026rsquo;s career at a certain point. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re not aware of the details of how they appear or how these biases can be guarded against, most mature engineers I know have a level of self-awareness to at least recognize they (like everyone) are susceptible to them.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Allspaw, John. n.d. “On Being A Senior Engineer.” Kitchen Soap.

Often, \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company\u0026rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.\n   Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance. However, this is only possible if the problem space is well understood. Premature abstraction, in code or elsewhere, introduces risk. If the failure modes in production are poorly understood, volunteering for pager duty may be the only way to really help.\n   Most risks, especially where managed effectively, never come to pass. For this reason, it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to tell the difference between real risk and perceived risk. By the same token, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real impact and perceived impact. If a senior engineer identifies a significant risk, they have to be able to concisely explain and prioritize it for a non-expert audience.\n   Every company has different risks, and so every company expects something different from their senior engineers. An engineer who has spent the last five years making small, continuous improvements to the processes in a larger company may not enjoy or even understand the sort of role expected by a three person startup.

You might spend an hour writing a careful reply, capturing your latest thinking. And now\u0026hellip; it lives in your \u0026ldquo;sent\u0026rdquo; folder, and briefly in the impression on your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s mind. The effort accumulates only insofar as that work subtly influences your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s thinking over time.\nLikewise, Most people take only transient notes, though with effective practices, they\u0026rsquo;re an essential foundation; see Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.\nWe should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time.\nA Spaced repetition memory system achieves this for memory: when you find information useful, you can invest a little effort to make sure you always have it available. Over time, one\u0026rsquo;s spaced repetition library accumulates thousands of questions, and (I strongly suspect) that knowledge makes it easier to be an effective knowledge worker later.\nHamming illustrates this point vividly:\n\u0026ldquo;You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.\u0026rdquo; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode\u0026rsquo;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.\u0026rdquo;\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Matuschak, Andy. n.d. “Knowledge Work Should Accrete.” Andy’s Working Notes.

It is often called ‘the meta’.\n   Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.\n   What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.\n   The nature of the metagame demands that you play the base game well. It lives on top of the pattern-matching that comes with expertise.\nThis seems like an obvious thing to say. But as with most such things, the second-order implications are more interesting than the first-order ones. For instance, because expertise is necessary to play the metagame, it is often useful to search for the meta in your domain as a north star for expertise. The way I remind myself of this is to say that I should ‘locate the meta’ whenever I’m at the bottom of a skill tree. Even if I can’t yet participate, searching for the metagame that experts play will usually give me hints as to what skills I must acquire in order to become good enough.\nAn example suffices: in marketing, I have found it very useful to seek out articles or podcasts (but especially podcasts) where practitioners talk about the ways their best practices have changed: “In the past I did X and now it seems it doesn’t work as well, so now we do Y, and I recommend Y.” This tells me that:\nI need to learn Y and at least have a passing familiarity with X, because X is what came before and is ‘covered ground’, and I need to remember the ‘shape’ of the shift. If one such shift happened in the past, more may happen in the future. More concretely, this is something like a podcast guest saying:\n“In the past (for content marketing) I did roundup posts, but these don’t seem to work as well anymore. So now we do longer, more comprehensive guides, and we cross-launch those to Product Hunt and Hacker News and social media. That seems to work better for us.”\nWhich in turn tells me:\nI need to look up as many examples of these ‘comprehensive guides’ to see what the state of the art looks like. From there I can develop an understanding of how they are planned, how they are executed and what success looks like when these things are launched. And I must launch one to verify their effectiveness for myself. I need to try my hand at at least one roundup post, just for the tacit experience of doing it. And I must ask: why did roundup posts fail? Well, because too many people are doing it. (Is this true? How do I verify?) Why might the current best practice fail, then? I might not know the answer to this because I am a noob, but a side-effect of (1) is that I now know the best practitioners of the guide strategy, and I can observe them to see what changes in their marketing over the next few years. Note what I’m not saying, however. I’m not saying that I should actively pursue the meta — this is ineffective, because I am not good enough to play. I cannot execute even if I know where the puck is going. But studying the state of the metagame as it is right now often tells me what I must learn in order to get to that point.\n   If you can’t master a particular skill, drop back down to its component elements and practice each of them in isolation. If you don’t get good conversions in your content marketing, drop down to practice publishing at a regular cadence. If you can’t get a throw to work, break it down to arms, then legs, then body position, then into one complete motion.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2020. “To Get Good, Go After The Metagame.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/.

But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don’t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought. And interpreting an attempt to explore dissonance as a status grab that needs to be knocked down is absolutely fatal for that skill. Instead, you need to think of it as Socratic grilling – like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly.\nTolerating this is harder than it sounds. Most people can stay helpful for one or two iterations. But most people are bad at explaining things, so one or two iterations isn’t always enough I’ve had times when I need five or ten question-answer rounds with a teacher in order to understand what they’re telling me. The process sounds a lot like “The thing you just said is obviously wrong”…”no, that explanation you gave doesn’t make sense, you’re still obviously wrong”…”you keep saying the same thing over and over again, and it keeps being obviously wrong”…”no, that’s irrelevant to the point that’s bothering me”…”no, that’s also irrelevant, you keep saying an obviously wrong thing”…”Oh! That word means something totally different from what I thought it meant, now your statement makes total sense.”\nBut it’s harder even than that. Sometimes there is a vast inferential distance between you and the place where your teacher’s model makes sense, and you need to go through a process as laborious as converting a religious person to a materialist worldview (or vice versa) before the gap gets closed. The process of learning to really appreciate communism, or libertarianism, or whatever, coming from a diametrically opposed philosophy, looks a lot like dozens of questions about “but isn’t that an atrocity?” “wouldn’t this inevitably lead to dystopia?” and hearing what your interlocutor has to answer.

","title":"Wikipedia | SMART Criteria"},{"content":"(Donnino et al. 2021)\nSummary Thoughts Notes  PSRT is a treatment program designed for patients with non-specific chronic back pain. The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat. The course is delivered in small groups facilitated by a trained instructor. Participants receive reading materials on Dr. John Sarno\u0026rsquo;s and Dr. Howard Schubiner\u0026rsquo;s work to study during the intervention period. The educational sessions are focused on the relationship between psychological stress and pain and are divided in four components according to their content:\n Component 1: Psycophysiologic Pain Education  The mainstay of this component is for the participants to recognize their symptoms as a part of a psychophysiologic mind-body syndrome, as opposed to an exclusively physical etiology. This recognition is accomplished by exploring the history of their pain, identifying \u0026ldquo;inconsistencies\u0026rdquo; in the physical components of their pain (discrepancies in symptom localization and/or temporal occurrence), and acquiring information on the nature of nonspecific chronic back pain itself. Great focus is placed on the role of the relationship of underlying psychological stressors to physical pain. As participants are encouraged to examine the origin of the pain, they notice patterns in the experience of their pain that reflect the contribution of psychological and stress-related factors (e.g. e xperiencing severe back pain when driving but only when in heavy traffic, pain that occurs with sitting but not when sitting on a chairlift during recreational skiing, pain that is worse while walking into the workplace but fine when walking upon exiting). Hereby, participants gain awareness of the connection between pain and psychological processes and a better understanding of the variety of potentially modifiable factors that contribute to chronic back pain.\nExamples:\nIn the above example of an inconsistency, a participant complaining about back pain when driving, was able to identify that he was experiencing pain only while driving on busy roads and not on less busy roads. As a next step, the participant was able to recognize both the role of stress and the underlying emotion of anger that occurred when driving on a busy road. As the participant became able to recognize the feeling of anger in this situation, his pain during driving dissipated. This, in turn, provided insight into his pain in other circumstances and his overall pain resolved over time in conjunction with the other components of this program.\nAnother participant experienced pain while sitting, yet upon reflection, she recognized there were times when sitting did not cause pain such as when she was knitting (an activity she loved to do and which she found relaxing). During the course of this program, she was able to recognize this \u0026ldquo;inconsistency\u0026rdquo; as well as others and worked on desensitization (see component II). Additionally, she was able to realize that she put tremendous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother and wife. As she learned to be more accepting of herself, her unrealistic expectations of herself were reduced as was her pain experience.\n Component 2: Desensitization and Returning to Physical Activity  One of the main contributors hypothesized to contribute to chronic pain derived from psychophysiologic causes is that pain becomes a conditioned response to a physical trigger. According to the classical conditioning model, previously neutral stimuli can become linked to the pain experience. Thus, without the need for a current nociceptive input, this association can be coupled with physical reactions ultimately leading to pain. For example, formerly elicited pain-induced muscle tensions can become associated with other stimuli like sitting or walking and lead to fear and avoidance of these positions/movements. This association can result in fear of recreating pain and thus avoidance of these movements Therefore, one of the key components of our therapy program is to \u0026ldquo;desensitize\u0026rdquo; the participants and break the cycle of pain. In order to achieve this goal, multiple desensitization techniques are utilized in this phase.\nVisual motor imagery (mental simulation of a painful situation) is a desensitization technique during which the participant is asked to first visualize a movement where pain typically occurs. Often (though not universally) the visualization will bring on pain. When this occurs, this serves to help the participant recognize that the pain can be elicited simply in his or her mind without any physical movement. This concept helps support the fact that the pain is psychophysiologic in nature. Next, the person is encouraged to repeatedly visualize the movement which caused pain while they are repeating self-soothing statements. With these repeated visualizations (without physical movement), the pain can ultimately wane and cannot be reproduced using visualization alone. When this process is complete (and pain can no longer be elicited), the patient can then proceed with slowly undertaking the actual movements/positions (see example below).\nAdditionally, identifying conditioned responses in daily life is a crucial part of this phase. For example, if sitting were a trigger, one would sit with the knowledge that the pain associated with sitting is a conditioned response and not actually related to some physical injury or component of sitting. Over time, the pain will dissipate, and the conditioning will be effectively reversed, allowing the participant to return to full physical activity. By returning to previous physical activity, patients also reinforce the \u0026ldquo;knowledge therapy\u0026rdquo; component as they begin to recognize that pain is not actually related to physical triggers per se, but rather psychological triggers. The safety of participants during this process is ensured through the gradual increase of activity under the supervision of a physician (see examples below).\nExample:\nA participant reported having pain with prolonged standing and notably when standing at a bus stop waiting for work. She attributed the pain to the physical activity of prolonged standing. Occasionally, she would return home and miss work because of the severity of the pain. During our program, she first visualized standing at the bus stop, and this reproduced her pain and discomfort. The ability for her to bring on severe pain simply through visualization allowed her to recognize the psychological component of her pain. She then reflected further on the situation from a different perspective and recognized that she was under a great degree of psychological stress while at the bus stop anticipating her day at work. With all this in mind, she first performed visual motor imagery repeatedly over a few days using self-soothing techniques until she reached the point that she could no longer reproduce the pain during visualization. Then, she stood at the bus stop reminding herself that the origin of the pain was not the physical act of standing. Over time, she stood for longer periods of time and the pain decreased despite the overall increase in physical activity. Ultimately, the pain resolved to the point where prolonged standing was no longer a trigger for her pain.\n Component 3: Emotional Expression - Psycology of the Syndrome  Reports on \u0026ldquo;functional\u0026rdquo; back pain conditions date back from as early as 1946 (1). The notion that chronic pain may persist as a manifestation of unexpressed negative affective states (e.g. hostility or aggressive impulses that the individual is unwilling or unable to acknowledge) was formulated in 1959 (2). Taking into consideration that some of the contributors to persistent pain include underlying stressful conflicts and aversive affective states, strategies encouraging emotional expression are essential in the treatment of mind-body syndrome. Emotional expression is accomplished through a series of writing exercises and journaling (free writing, cluster writing, letters of forgiveness, gratitude lists), self-reflection, as well as through small group discussion. A recent treatment developed by Drs. Schubiner and Lumley, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), includes similar techniques (3).\nAs an example, a participant realized during the above-mentioned exercises that he was being negatively impacted by the emotional pain caused by the imminent ending of his marriage. As he began to express his emotions, he noticed a significant reduction in his physical pain. Another example noted earlier was a patient who developed severe pain when driving on crowded streets but not on roads without traffic. He ultimately recognized that he was experiencing anger and frustration in a number of specific situations such as being stuck in traffic. This awareness of anger-related contributions to his pain (rather than an exclusively physical explanation that sitting for long periods results in mechanically induced increases in pain) and subsequent expression of those negative emotions helped the patient to improve his pain.\n Component 4: Stress reduction - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  As stress is an underlying component of MBS, the final arm of the program is to engage in stress-reduction techniques. By starting this program with the PSRT portion, participants are often already seeing improvements before embarking on this last portion of the program. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for the prevention and treatment of stress related disorders (4). MBSR has been linked to significant improvements in overall health and well-being, leading to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain (5, 6, 7). MBSR is an 8-week educational program which includes weekly sessions and mindful practice. Students are encouraged to perform daily home practice, which is explored throughout the program. Our MBSR classes adhered to the original protocol of the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. Our mindfulness sessions entail a series of strategies for cultivating present moment awareness - the ability to experience what is arising in the present moment. This allows for the observation of thoughts (past or future), the disengagement from emotional reactivity and the ability to stay with the sensate experience in the body - the outcome of which is a deeper sense of ease, emotional balance and general well-being.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Donnino, Michael W., Garrett S.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.  One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.   The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.  There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; study method, though some are better than others. The study method which will be most effective will depend on the situation in which you will need to recall the information.    Terms  Testing Effect Item-specific Processing Relational Processing Permastore  Thoughts Anki seems highly relevant here; it combines spaced repetition and the benefits of the testing effect. However, I think it would be easy to create flashcards which aid in memorizing a fact but not in understanding or application. For instance: I could imagine a card which asks you to recall the abstract steps required to multiply a IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix. I think this card, on its own, would not be sufficient to maintain understanding or the ability to perform matrix multiplication. Perhaps you could supplement the card with others which ask:\n What conditions are necessary to multiply two matrices (AxB and CxD)? A card, or several, which provide specific examples using numbers rather than generalizations? Perhaps there is a script or addon which allows for this sort of thing.  I worry that Anki wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough to maintain understanding and the ability to apply this knowledge even with these, and more, cards. It would certainly reduce the barrier to re-entry. I used to understand much more calculus than I could prove to you now after letting it fall out of my mind since college. Keeping up with calculus topics, example problems, definitions, etc, through Anki would at least make it easier for me to jump back in should the need arise. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be as \u0026ldquo;on the ball\u0026rdquo; as I would if I were actively using and practicing calculus regularly, but I would be at a better place than I am now.\nMemory in Educational Settings Guiding Theoretical Principles Introducing \u0026ldquo;Desirable Difficulties\u0026rdquo; During Learning  Performance during learning is a poor predictor of future performance because it reflects the momentary accessibility of knowledge (i.e., retrieval strength) rather than how well it has been stored in memory (i.e., storage strength)\n   Storage strength increases when a memory is retrieved or the event is reexperienced.\n   [I]f knowledge is to be retained over long periods of time, then the goal of learning must be to increase storage strength, not momentary accessibility.\n   Based on the distinction between retrieval strength and storage strength, R. A. Bjork and colleagues developed the concept of “desirable difficulties” in learning (Bjork, 1994a, 1994b; Christina \u0026amp; Bjork, 1991; Schmidt \u0026amp; Bjork, 1992). The main idea is that introducing difficulties during learning will result in superior long-term retention because the greatest gains in storage strength occur when retrieval strength is low. For example, consider the practice of using flash cards to study vocabulary words. If you study a word and then try to remember it immediately, then the gain in storage strength will be relatively low because it is so easy to retrieve the word right away (retrieval strength is high). However, if you wait 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the word (when retrieval strength will be lower), then the gain in storage strength will be larger. The implication for educational practice is that instead of arranging the conditions of learning to be easier and faster for the learner, educators should introduce difficulties into the learning process in order to promote long-term retention of knowledge.\n Processing Information to Extract Meaning  Critically, directing attention at a lower or “shallow” level of processing (e.g., focusing on the orthography of words while reading) disrupts higher or “deeper” levels of processing (e.g., determining what those words mean). As a result, the type of processing in which one consciously engages determines what information will be encoded into memory and retained. The type of processing is more important than the intent to learn (e.g., Craik \u0026amp; Tulving, 1975); the implication is that a student who deliberately prepares for a test but who does not engage in deep processing will not do as well as the student who processes the material deeply, even if the latter student is not deliberately trying to learn the material.\n   One helpful distinction involves item- specific processing versus relational processing (Hunt \u0026amp; Einstein, 1981). Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.\nIn contrast, relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other. In short, both item-specific and relational processing can involve meaning extraction, but they direct the learner to different aspects of the to-be- remembered events.\n Importance of Match Between Processing at Encoding and Retrieval  Rather, memory performance is the joint product of the way in which the memory was encoded (i.e., the memory trace that is stored) and the way in which it is retrieved (i.e., the cues provided) (e.g., Tulving \u0026amp; Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving \u0026amp; Osler, 1968). This idea is codified in the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, which states that memory performance will be enhanced to the extent that the processes engaged during initial learning match the processes required for the criterial task\n   In short, there is not always a single right answer about which study strategy will be best. Rather, as reflected in ideas about transfer-appropriate processing, the ideal study strategy depends upon what the student will need to do later.\n Summary  We have presented three general cognitive principles that are critical for determining memory performance in educational settings:\n introducing desirable difficulties during learning engaging in processes that emphasize meaning extraction and matching learning processes to the processes needed to excel on the final criterial task (i.e., transfer-appropriate processing).   Learning Strategies for Studying Material Receiving Advance Organizers Highlighting and Underlining Note Taking  Although note taking yields memorial benefits, the type of notes naturally taken may not be the most powerful mnemonic possible. One issue involves how much note taking involves going beyond the to-be-remembered information (versus simply copying; see Marsh \u0026amp; Sink, 2010), including paraphrasing the to-be-remembered information and connecting it to stored knowledge. Returning to the levels of processing framework, the key issue is the depth of processing note taking naturally affords. We have just reviewed evidence that note taking encourages relational processing that affords transfer. Nevertheless, additional benefit may come from techniques that encourage the reader or listener to process the material even more deeply. For example, King (1992) trained students to summarize material, specifically how to identify and encapsulate the main idea. This group of students was compared to another group who took notes naturally, and who later had a chance to review those notes. Students who summarized the lecture performed better on both immediate and delayed comprehension tests than students who took notes (see Bretzing \u0026amp; Kulhavy, 1979, for similar results). Similarly, the note-taking group did not do as well as a group of students trained to ask themselves (and answer) questions about the material. Students might benefit from incorporating some of these deep processing techniques into their notes; in other words, training might help students to take notes that include more of the generative processing thought to be key for transfer (e.g., Peper \u0026amp; Mayer, 1978).\n Learning Strategies for Poststudy Retrieval Practice  \u0026hellip; memory research has shown that retrieving information from memory actually changes memory (e.g., Bjork, 1975), improving long-term retention of the material\n   The finding that retrieval practice produces superior long-term retention has been termed the testing effect\n   When testing is used as a learning tool in educational settings, there are several ways in which its efficacy can be enhanced.\n Tests that require students to produce a response, such as short-answer and essay tests, generally lead to better retention than tests that simply require the selection of the correct response, such as multiple-choice tests and true/false tests. Taking multiple tests results in better retention than taking a single test, so it is beneficial to repeat questions on quizzes and give cumulative exams. Successful retrieval is the key to learning from tests, so providing feedback after the test is essential, especially if test-takers do not retrieve many correct responses  (paraphrased)\n Processing Feedback to Correct Errors  The most consistent result is that providing learners with the correct answer in the feedback message produces better subsequent performance than simply indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect (e.g., Pashler et al., 2005; for a meta-analysis, see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, \u0026amp; Morgan, 1991). This finding makes sense because informing the learner that a given response is incorrect will not help the learner to correct the error if the learner does not have any recourse to learn the correct answer.\n Spacing Out Practice Over Time  \u0026hellip; [I]t seems that the optimal interval depends on how long the knowledge needs to be retained after the last practice (i.e., the retention interval). Cepeda and colleagues (2006; see also Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, \u0026amp; Pashler, 2008) performed a meta-analysis that included 317 experiments from 184 articles on the spacing effect. They found that the optimal spacing interval is approximately 10%–20% of the retention interval. Thus, if the goal is to retain the material for 5 days, then practice should be spaced over intervals between 12 and 24 hours\n Combining Techniques Applying the Guiding Principles and Learning Strategies in Educational Settings Long-Term Learning Learning Beyond Facts  \u0026hellip; [I]n the classroom, educators have many different goals for their students, and these goals vary as a function of the level of education, the type of course, and the time frame given for learning, among many other factors. One way of categorizing these goals is through Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives, which conceptualizes learning as a hierarchy in which the various levels must be mastered in sequential order. The cognitive domain is comprised of six levels (from lowest to highest):\n knowledge (e.g., learning facts, concepts, etc.) comprehension (e.g., understanding the relationship between ideas) application (e.g., using knowledge to solve new problems) analysis (e.g., finding evidence to support a hypothesis) synthesis (e.g., combining different accounts of an event to understand what occurred) evaluation (e.g., assessing the validity of an idea according to certain criteria)   Permastore\nThe Relativity of Memory TODO Authors .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Marsh, Elizabeth J., and Andrew C.

Not only they have weak coding skills but there are also a few other things that give Junior developers away:\n Their main mantra is \u0026ldquo;making it work\u0026rdquo; without giving much attention to how the solution is achieved. To them, a working software and good software are equivalent. They usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something. They suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members. Most of the Junior developers just try to live up to the role and, when stuck, they might leave work for a senior developer instead of at least trying to take a stab at something. They don\u0026rsquo;t know about the business side of the company and don\u0026rsquo;t realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and they don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain. Over-engineering is a major problem, often leading to fragility and bugs. When given a problem, they often try to fix just the current problem a.k.a. fixing the symptoms instead of fixing the root problem. You might notice the \u0026ldquo;Somebody Else\u0026rsquo;s Problem\u0026rdquo; behavior from them. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what or how much they don\u0026rsquo;t know, thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect. They don\u0026rsquo;t take initiatives and they might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase. They don\u0026rsquo;t participate in team discussions.   Mid Level Developers  The next level after the Junior developers is Mid Level developers. They are technically stronger than the Junior developers and can work with minimal supervision. They still have some issues to address in order to jump to Senior level.\n   Mid-level developers are quite common. Most of the organizations wrongly label them as \u0026ldquo;Senior Developers\u0026rdquo;. However, they need further mentoring in order to become Senior Developers.\n Senior Developers  Senior developers are the next level after the Mid-level developers. They are the people who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road. They are more mature, have gained experience by delivering both good and bad software in the past and have learned from it — they know how to be pragmatic. Here is the list of things that are normally expected of a Senior Developer:\n With their past experiences, mistakes made, issues faced by over-designed or under-designed software, they can foresee the problems and persuade the direction of the codebase or the architecture. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;Shiny-Toy\u0026rdquo; syndrome. They are pragmatic in the execution. They can make the tradeoffs when required, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic. They have a good picture of the field, know what the best tool for the job is in most cases (even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the tool). They have the innate ability to pick up a new tool/language/paradigm/etc in order to solve a problem that requires it. They are aware they\u0026rsquo;re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs to taking un-glorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done. They have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development. They don\u0026rsquo;t make empty complaints, they make judgments based on the empirical evidence and they have suggestions for solutions. They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code. They have the ability to take on large ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract, and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them. They have respect for the code that was written before them. They are generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. They approach inheriting legacy code with an \u0026ldquo;opportunity mindset\u0026rdquo; rather than a complaining one. They know how to give feedback without hurting anyone.   .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Ahmed, Kamran. n.d. “Levels of Seniority.” Https://Roadmap.Sh/Guides/Levels-of-Seniority.

Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a “fear of success”; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)\nWhy do most of us, most of the time, choose to \u0026ldquo;pursue our goals\u0026rdquo; through routes that are far less effective than the routes we could find if we tried? My guess is that here, as with the calculus test, the main problem is that most courses of action are extremely ineffective, and that there has been no strong evolutionary or cultural force sufficient to focus us on the very narrow behavior patterns that would actually be effective.\nTo be more specific: there are clearly at least some limited senses in which we have goals. We: (1) tell ourselves and others stories of how we’re aiming for various “goals”; (2) search out modes of activity that are consistent with the role, and goal-seeking, that we see ourselves as doing (“learning math”; “becoming a comedian”; “being a good parent”); and sometimes even (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do/don’t achieve our “goals”.\nBut there are clearly also heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement (or that would be part of what it means to “have goals” at all) that we do not automatically carry out. We do not automatically:\n(a) Ask ourselves what we’re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (“what does it look like to be a good comedian?”) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven’t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren’t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don’t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that isn’t going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our \u0026ldquo;goal\u0026rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won\u0026rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting; \u0026hellip;. or carry out any number of other useful techniques. Instead, we mostly just do things. We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal. We do any number of things. But we do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions that would effectively optimize for our claimed goals, or for any other goals.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}NO_ITEM_DATA:annasalamonHumansAreNot2010  ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/annasalamonhumansarenot2010/","summary":"Anna Salamon, (NO_ITEM_DATA:annasalamonHumansAreNot2010)\nSummary Thoughts Notes  Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test?

A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people. An essay is stronger when it can afford to omit qualification (eg: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps\u0026rdquo;).  Additionally, for Graham, a useful essay is one which says things as simply as possible.\nThoughts Notes  What should an essay be? [\u0026hellip;] useful.\n   Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn\u0026rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\n   In effect the [novelty, correctness, importance, and strength] are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.\n   [\u0026hellip;] if you write a bad sentence, you don\u0026rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s a trick for getting importance too. It\u0026rsquo;s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they\u0026rsquo;ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\n   The way to get novelty is to write about topics you\u0026rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who\u0026rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n   [\u0026hellip;] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. [\u0026hellip;] As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you\u0026rsquo;re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm\u0026rsquo;s length with perhapses.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It\u0026rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it\u0026rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader\u0026rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that\u0026rsquo;s too long.\n   Sometimes the reason people don\u0026rsquo;t know something is because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to know it.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}NO_ITEM_DATA:HowWriteUsefully  ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/howwriteusefully/","summary":"Paul Graham, (NO_ITEM_DATA:HowWriteUsefully)\nSummary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:\n A novel essay communicates a \u0026ldquo;new thing\u0026rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience.

But the short version is: they all agree that everything went wrong when we switched from saturated to unsaturated fat.\n It stands out because Scott specifically mentions the edge of his research and yet published the piece anyway. There is a loud voice in the back of my head whenever I\u0026rsquo;m writing anything \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; which drives me to go deeper and that stones left unturned will mar my writing.

Today, he weighs about 195. The change is even starker at the extremes. Someone at the 90th percentile of weight back then weighed about 185 lbs; today, he would weigh 320 lbs. Back then, about 1% of men were obese. Today, about 25% are.\n   The answer to all these questions seems to be something like “the body is pretty good at regulating its own weight under any diet except modern American processed food.” But what aspect of processed food makes it bad?\n   The only common villain everyone agrees on in the obesity story is “processed food”. I’ve previously found this frustrating – it reeks of a sort of unreflective technophobia. What part of processing makes food bad? How does mere contact with a machine turn food from healthy to unhealthy? What food counts as “processed” or “not processed”? Is ground beef processed, since you grind it?

In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] the notion that \u0026lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [\u0026hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.\nThe first idea is the ‘recognition-primed decision making’ model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses. I’ve written extensively about the model on this blog, so I’m not going to repeat myself [\u0026hellip;] but the core of it is simply that expertise is an implicit memory operation: you recognise a situation in a developing environment and then unspool that recognition into a set of cues, a list of plausible goals, and handful of expectancies, and a series of trained actions. if the situation is novel, you construct variants of intended actions on the fly and simulate these scenarios in a loop, picking the first workable solution in your mind.\nThis model of expert decision-making is useful because it gives us a usable model of expertise — far better than the ones found in the deliberate practice literature. For example, one conclusion from this model is that if you want to become better at something, you should look for ways to expand the set of recognisable prototypes in your head.\nThe second idea is simply that expertise rests on technê, or tacit knowledge — the sort of knowledge that is impossible to communicate, that must be constructed from practice. I’ve written about this idea numerous times over the past two years: first in my original criticism of mental model writing, then in my reflection on Seymour Papert’s life’s work. I covered it again in The Mental Model FAQ and The Dangers of Treating Ideas from Finance as Generalised Self Help. I’ve mentioned it here and there throughout Commonplace’s history; indeed, my reliance on technê is one of the big pieces of idea scaffolding for this blog.\n[emphasis mine]\n   [\u0026hellip;] perhaps the art of practice is simply whatever is the most effective method of expanding one’s collection of recognisable prototypes (and of course: the actions to take in response to those recognisable prototypes).\n   What about creativity, for instance? Klein covers this in his research; in Sources of Power he discusses how expert minds use pattern-recognition to identify ‘leverage points’ — points in which one could do something radically different — in order to come up with creative solutions within the constraints of some domain. I’ve dug a little into the research and I think the take is plausible, but I’m not entirely convinced. Surely the mechanism of creativity is different from the prototype-based recognition that drives most of expertise? The short answer to that seems to be ‘yes, creativity relies on connections between different ideas and this is independent of expertise’ but also ‘identifying the right leverage points is still a recognition/expertise thing’. The two seem highly intertwined in the sorts of fields that Klein studies; my remaining scepticism is that I do not know if this is true in ‘pure’ creative domains like art and design and fiction writing.\n Thoughts The idea rings true to me when I think about how chess masters describe thinking about the game in the moment. I recall them mentioning pattern matching explicitly; though I\u0026rsquo;ve since lost the reference.\nSee Tacit Knowledge.\n.csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2020. “Expertise Is ’Just’ Pattern Matching.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/expertise-is-just-pattern-matching/.

Don’t have a fight when you’re physiologically aroused. Monitor your physiological arousal, and if you start to notice the signs – fast heartbeat, tense muscles, shallow breathing – call a time-out, go somewhere else, and use meditation or deep breathing or whatever to calm down.\n(Alexander 2020)\n   Gottman divides conflicts into two types: solvable and unsolvable. Solvable conflicts are simple, specific, and about the thing they seem to be about – for example, the husband is supposed to take the trash out after work, but work has gotten really stressful lately and he keeps forgetting, and now the trash is overflowing and the wife is annoyed. The solution here is to use normal problem-solving techniques. Put a sign in the bedroom saying “DID YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT?” or something. Whatever.\nUnsolvable conflicts are temporary manifestations of deep psychological issues. The particular thing that sparked the fight this time is irrelevant, but both spouses will fight to the death because it represents something important. For example, the husband is late to dinner one night because he went out to the bar. The wife yells at him and says he doesn’t care about her. He yells back that she’s a control freak. Here the problem will not be solved by coming up with a compromise where he can go to the bar half of nights. The problem is that she secretly worries his drinking buddies have a closer connection to him than she ever will, that he doesn’t love her anymore, that he goes to the bar to escape her. He worries that he’s lost his freedom, that he’s become emasculated, that he’s become some boring old person who is never allowed to have fun. If the bar burnt down tomorrow, they would find some other excuse to fight over this dynamic.\n(Alexander 2020)\n   Desperation breeds gullibility. Patients with terminal diseases, however smart they used to be, turn to homeopaths and charlatans rather than face the dismal truth.\n(Alexander 2020)\n   [\u0026hellip;] whenever I hear people talk about relationships, I hear weird echoes of political problems. People who hate their spouse have an outgroup of one. A unified polity has devolved into partisanship. Social trust has been broken; a defect-defect equilibrium is in place. Gottman thinks of couples as a two-person culture, and some of those cultures are decadent and fractious.\n(Alexander 2020)\n   In marriage, as in other forms of politics, sometimes exit \u0026gt; voice.

But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important.\nIt’s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren’t just about churning out work—they’re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.\nIn other words, the main benefit of being fast is that you end up doing different things. Nelson Elhage’s point—“having faster tools changes how users use a tool”—applies across nearly every domain:\n If you respond to your emails quickly instead of slowly, you’ll get access to more new opportunities, and end up prioritizing them over whatever you would have done instead. If you make it 10x faster to test your code, you don’t just save time waiting on tests—you can start doing test-driven development, discover your mistakes earlier, and save yourself from going down bad paths. If you deploy your new app now instead of next week, you’ll learn how users like the new features one week earlier, and you’ll be able to feed that knowledge back into future product decisions.

I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.\n Wondrous The Space Within  The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.\n   The task was to make a cylinder. The word \u0026ldquo;pot\u0026rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.\n Beginnings and Endings  The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.\n   The variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.\n Cylinders as Pots  The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.\n   Of particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.\n   The cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).\n Figure 44\nPitchers  It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.\n   A useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.\n   If you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.\n Bowls  Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.\n Pots with Lids   TODO  Learning to See   TODO  Style and Voice   TODO  Utility and Tradition   TODO  Place   TODO  Notes    TODO\n.csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Illian, Clary. 2012.

Byrne Hobart\n   “50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It’s when you start habitually asking “how could this go faster?” It’s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It’s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.\nIn the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I’d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner’s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting faster compounding growth.\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Kuhn, Ben. 2020. “Attention Is Your Scarcest Resource.” https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/.

You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\ncrdrost\n   Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulty\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that learning something, forgetting it and then struggling to learn it again leads to faster learning times. It may be that struggle is inherent in the process of learning something complex. If you equate struggle with pain, then I think it makes some sense.\nmikekchar\n   In my ~20 years of experience, the only way to get good at something that is incredibly complex like kernel development, you will need to actually try to build the thing. Over and over and over.\nbob1029\n   In the language learning example, Extensive Reading leads to not only picking up and remembering words, but also collocations, grammar and even cultural beliefs of the speakers of the target language. Single word flash cards miss all of that. Full sentence flashcards do a bit better but still fall short.\nI think the best use for SRS for something like a language or programming is for laying down a scaffold in the very early stages of learning, and then moving to more productive uses of study time as soon as possible.\nAlchemistCamp, replying to stared\n This raises an important point in the use of spaced repetition systems (SRS). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words. Spaced repetition systems lend themselves easily to the study of small chunks of information (eg: definitions) but it is more difficult to apply them to higher-level applications of knowledge and understanding (eg: essay writing).\n I think semantic tree/first principles/physics-based approach (popularly attributed to Elon Musk) is one way to approach it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a really difficult approach and you need a certain level of intelligence and personality to do it well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. I can do it to some extent but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really difficult to hold lots of ideas in tension and to be questioning all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s just not my thinking style.\nThe other approach is what many smart (but non-geniuses) take: the buffet approach. You graze at the table of books, Wikipedia, online articles, and hang out in online communities (like Twitter) to overhear what experts are discussing. The thing about most areas of knowledge is, there\u0026rsquo;s usually only 20% of the subject that matters\u0026ndash;the rest rarely come up (Pareto Principle). To know what 20% to focus on, you need to understand the sociology of the subject matter and what experts think are important. Unlike the previous approach, you won\u0026rsquo;t have watershed-level insights, but you\u0026rsquo;ll know enough to be considered \u0026ldquo;educated\u0026rdquo; on the subject.\nwenc\n .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?” n.d.

It may be that struggle is inherent in the process of learning something complex. If you equate struggle with pain, then I think it makes some sense.\nmikekchar\n   In my ~20 years of experience, the only way to get good at something that is incredibly complex like kernel development, you will need to actually try to build the thing. Over and over and over.\nbob1029\n   In the language learning example, Extensive Reading leads to not only picking up and remembering words, but also collocations, grammar and even cultural beliefs of the speakers of the target language. Single word flash cards miss all of that. Full sentence flashcards do a bit better but still fall short.\nI think the best use for SRS for something like a language or programming is for laying down a scaffold in the very early stages of learning, and then moving to more productive uses of study time as soon as possible.\nAlchemistCamp, replying to stared\n This raises an important point in the use of spaced repetition systems (SRS). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words. Spaced repetition systems lend themselves easily to the study of small chunks of information (eg: definitions) but it is more difficult to apply them to higher-level applications of knowledge and understanding (eg: essay writing).\n I think semantic tree/first principles/physics-based approach (popularly attributed to Elon Musk) is one way to approach it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a really difficult approach and you need a certain level of intelligence and personality to do it well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. I can do it to some extent but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really difficult to hold lots of ideas in tension and to be questioning all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s just not my thinking style.\nThe other approach is what many smart (but non-geniuses) take: the buffet approach. You graze at the table of books, Wikipedia, online articles, and hang out in online communities (like Twitter) to overhear what experts are discussing. The thing about most areas of knowledge is, there\u0026rsquo;s usually only 20% of the subject that matters\u0026ndash;the rest rarely come up (Pareto Principle). To know what 20% to focus on, you need to understand the sociology of the subject matter and what experts think are important. Unlike the previous approach, you won\u0026rsquo;t have watershed-level insights, but you\u0026rsquo;ll know enough to be considered \u0026ldquo;educated\u0026rdquo; on the subject.\nwenc\n Thoughts Relevant: How to Read a Paper\n.csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?” n.d.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.\nNote that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.\nWhy Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.\nI expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment. I chose to attempt a sleep schedule called dual core, which has 5.5 sleeping hours per day, as it was supposed2 to be possible to maintain the schedule indefinitely.\n   Sleep Schedule Hours Awake Per Day Expected Years Left1 Expected Waking Years Left     Monophasic 15 50.4 31.50   Dual Core 1 18.5 50.4 38.85    As the table indicates: sleeping for 3.5 fewer hours daily equates to an increased waking-time life expectancy of 7.35 years. But what would I do with those hours?\nGiven that this was a trial, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time. I expected that I would be exhausted as I adapted to the new sleep schedule.\nThe Trial Sleep Schedule The dual core sleep schedule I attempted was composed of three sleeping times per day.\n   Name Start time End time Duration (hours)     Core 1 22:00 01:30 3.5   Core 2 05:30 07:00 1.5   Nap 13:30 14:00 0.5    I maintained this schedule for 40 days from April 4th, 2021 through June 13th, 2021.\nMeasuring the Impact I opted to do no cognitive tests, etc, during this trial. I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.\nRetrospective How I Felt Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is repartitioning. In short, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases3. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it\u0026rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.\nNonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (531), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I\u0026rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.\nOverall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn\u0026rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I\u0026rsquo;d say that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a negative impact.\nPhysical Symptoms Sleepiness Suprisingly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired \u0026ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.\nDifficulty Waking Up I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (\u0026gt;25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.\n\u0026ldquo;Third Person\u0026rdquo; Feelings Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m watching a TV show right now\u0026rdquo; before the show is over? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.\nI would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; of myself rather than just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.\nHeadaches I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I\u0026rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren\u0026rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.\nSticking to the Schedule Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc4. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using Sleep as Android and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.\nQuality of Sleep I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.\nSleep as Android tracks the duration of \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.\nHow I Seemed to Those Around Me I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she\u0026rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.\nSleep Schedule Going Forward I\u0026rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.\nI had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I\u0026rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there\u0026rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.\nMore and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn\u0026rsquo;t have more to show for it. I\u0026rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours. If I don\u0026rsquo;t, then why not just keep sleeping through them?\nTo that end I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my focus from \u0026ldquo;get more hours\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;do more with the hours I have\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll take another look at polyphasic sleep once I get to the point where I feel I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the hours I already have.\n  Based on my current age and life expectancy.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The vast majority of writing I found with a positive tilt on polyphasic sleep is annecdotal.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Note that I haven\u0026rsquo;t found much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I don\u0026rsquo;t recall where I read this.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/polyphasic_sleep_40_day_trial_results/","summary":"What would you do with another few hours every day?

To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026quot;\n   Cached Selves by Anna Salamon\nThe idea that my actions are so easily influenced is disconcerting to say the least. The author is writing about commitment and consistency effects with the goal of reducing their effectiveness. I think it would be wise to attempt to incorporate a bit of the author's advice into how I conduct myself. The most straight-forward suggestion is to \u0026quot;[t]ake care never to say anything but what is best supported by the evidence, aloud or to yourself, lest you come to believe it\u0026quot;. Identifying what is supported by the evidence and which evidence is trust-worthy is another can of worms.\n  Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic by Anna Salamon\n We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal.\n   Learned Blankness by Anna Salamon\n Martin Seligman coined the term \u0026quot;learned helplessness\u0026quot; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I\u0026rsquo;ll call this \u0026ldquo;learned blankness\u0026rdquo;. Folks who fall prey to learned blankness may still take actions \u0026ndash; sometimes my students practiced the procedures again and again, hired a tutor, etc. But they do so as though carrying out rituals to an unknown god \u0026ndash; parts of them may be trying, but their \u0026ldquo;understand X\u0026rdquo; center has given up.\n   The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books by Cedric Chin\nI'm not sure if all non-fiction books could be adequately categorized by these three labels. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the vocabulary to describe books I've read that seem like over-stuffed musings on a single idea which would have been better served by a short blog post rather than a book.\n  What is a Career Moat? by Cedric Chin\n A career moat is an individual's ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.\n   The Power of Pomodoros by elharo\n Pomodoros aren\u0026rsquo;t (for me) a means of avoiding procrastination or dividing time among projects. They\u0026rsquo;re a way of blasting through Ugh fields.\n   The Monthly Newsletter as a Thinking Tool by Matt Freeman\nThis post.\n  (a) by Milan Griffes\nI like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that could be automated through some \u0026quot;presubmit\u0026quot; step of the publishing process. I've looked around but haven't found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links. I expect that I won't bother to include them so long as I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain content will be present and determined readers will be able to consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.\nI also notice that the author includes (sometimes long) relevant quotes from links they cite, or even a long quote and nothing else. I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the goal of \u0026quot;(a)\u0026quot;.\n  Meaningful Rest by Neel Nanda\n An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, these lists are basically disjoint!\n  Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower. (I elaborate far more on this model in this post)\n   Productivity by Sam Altman\nThere is a lot of good advice in here. I especially appreciated the point about avoiding productivity porn. \u0026quot;Chasing productivity for its own sake isn't helpful\u0026quot;. I've done that chase before and at best it's a time sink and at worst it's a form of self-deception. As such, I want to be sure to do more than just read the article and then proceed with my life as it was before. I've had more success integrating change gradually and building on small accomplishments as opposed to attempting to overhaul all of my habits at once. I'll try to tackle one piece of advice weekly, of my own highlights from the article, and attempt to work it into my life that week.\n  Noticing the Taste of Lotus by Valentine\nThe idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention. The importance of, and ways to maintain, focus and attention are a common theme in several other articles recently (at least recent to me and my discovery of them).\nThe author's follow-up review of their own writing distinguishes a few claims made in the piece:\n   External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are lotuses.)\n  It's possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can notice the taste of lotuses.)\n  It's good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned with others' goals regardless of how they relate to our own.\n  If you notice this, you'll find yourself wanting to spit out lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.\n   I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims. Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There's a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio, for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories, throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It's not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it's a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I've realigned my goals around the game and that those new goals won't take me where I want to go.\n  Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software Developer by Zachary Betz\nI think the author makes a good point. Perhaps I'm less interested than others would be as I've seen these ideas already expressed by Cal Newport.\n  Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger) by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo;; naru is \u0026ldquo;becoming,\u0026rdquo; and the form naritai is \u0026ldquo;want to become.\u0026rdquo; Together it means, \u0026ldquo;I want to become stronger,\u0026rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I\u0026rsquo;ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player\u0026mdash;or after you lose an important match, but you haven\u0026rsquo;t given up\u0026mdash;or after you win an important match, but you\u0026rsquo;re not a ninth-dan player yet\u0026mdash;or after you\u0026rsquo;ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence\n   Something to Protect by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.\n   Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now by Alexy Guzey\n This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing not only helps you to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.\n   Making Yourself Small by Helen\n .. probably the most important thing is your mental/emotional state - a friend suggested \u0026ldquo;not wanting to startle a small bird\u0026rdquo; as an mindset to inhabit, to encourage yourself to become \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo;.\n   Seeing the Smoke by Jacob Falkovich\n As Eliezer reminded us, most people sitting alone in a room will quickly get out if it starts filling up with smoke. But if two other people in the room seem unperturbed, almost everyone will stay put. That is the result of a famous experiment from the 1960s and its replications \u0026mdash; people will sit and nervously look around at their peers for 20 minutes even as thick smoke starts obscuring their vision.\n  In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?\nExponential growth is hard for people to grasp. Most people answer \u0026lsquo;24\u0026rsquo; to the above question, or something random like \u0026lsquo;35\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive to people that the lily pads could be barely noticeable on day 44 and yet completely cover the lake on day 48.\n   Be Impatient by Ben Kuhn\n Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n   Attention is your scarcest resource by Ben Kuhn\n \u0026quot;The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:\n\u0026lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.\n10-50% focus: \u0026ldquo;meets expectations,\u0026rdquo; gets regular raises.\n50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.\u0026quot;\nByrne Hobart\n\u0026quot;50%+ focus\u0026quot; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start habitually asking \u0026quot;how could this go faster?\u0026quot; It\u0026rsquo;s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time\u0026mdash;or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   ","permalink":"http://cashweaver.com/posts/links/","summary":"Links 2021 May   Theory of Change by Aaron Swartz\n A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action \u0026mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it.
