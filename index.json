And if the audience does not like it, it should drive them crazy seeing how much YOU love it.\u0026rdquo;\nHer portfolio was chock full of neon colors and glitter and rhinestones and splashes of peacock feathers and it was a delight. Our teacher despised every piece lol, but she got great marks and I think even won some awards. And more importantly, she was happy and proud of the results.

This means the difficulty of the exercise you have chosen, or the number of reps you have performed exceeds the capability of your intrinsic core muscles (mostly your transverse abdominis). This is a good marker for appropriate intensity. If you feel this, make it easier.\n Level 0: Breathing  Deadbug Level 0: Breath Control (a)\n   [\u0026hellip;] lie flat on your back with your knees up (you can also put your legs up on a chair, or your bed). Place one hand on your upper chest (just below your neck, around your collarbones) and the other between the bottom of your ribs and your belly-button.\n Breathe in and out. Your upper hand should not move. Your lower hand should move up and down with your breath.\nLevel 1: Static hold  Deadbug Level 1: Static Hold (a)\n Lie on the ground, with your knees up and feet on the floor just in front of your butt, relaxed. Take a nice deep diaphragm-driven breath in, and then start to breathe all your air out like you\u0026rsquo;re blowing out through a big straw As you are breathing out, start ratcheting up the tension in your brace, engaging all the core muscles as we outlined above:  Ribs Down (Rectus Abs and/or Internal Obliques) Belly in (Transverse Abs) Ribs Narrow/Together (Internal Obliques)   Once you are fully tense and fully out of air, you can lift the legs up to 90 degrees, and start taking little sips of air, expanding mostly into your sides and back, but also potentially into your belly if you have that degree of control over your internal obliques. If you can\u0026rsquo;t yet do either, sorry you\u0026rsquo;ll have to hold your breath or else you\u0026rsquo;ll lose tension. At no point should your lower back lose gentle contact with the floor. It should not be pressing hard into it, but it also should not be arched.      Deadbug Level 1a: One Arm Extension (a) Deadbug Level 1b: Both Arm Extension (a)  This variation of deadbug is useful for individuals who struggle not to flare their ribs in things like handstands, overhead presses, and such. [\u0026hellip;] if you have a very weak brace, then simply moving your arms as far overhead as you can will involuntarily cause your ribs to lift in order to compensate.\n Deadbug Error #1: Rib Flare (a)   Level 2: 90 degree one-leg extension  Deadbug Level 2: 90deg Heel Taps (a)\nIn the braced, static deadbug position, keeping your legs locked at 90 degrees of knee bend, slowly lower one leg down until the heel gently touches the floor, then return it to the start position. Repeat with the other leg, that\u0026rsquo;s one rep.\n Level 3: Single-leg extension  Deadbug Level 3: Single Leg Extension (a)\n[\u0026hellip;] starting in the braced static starting position, slowly extend one leg out, reaching your heel far out and down until your leg is straight. In a scenario of ideal hip flexibility, you should seek to reach your calf to the floor (depending on the size of your calf, your only your heel may touch as mine does, this is fine). If your hip flexibility is limited, only lower the leg as far to the floor as you can without losing your mid-line position (i.e. without your lower back arching to compensate).\n Level 4: Contralateral extension (opposite limb; marching)  Deadbug Level 4: Contralateral Extensions (a)\nFurther difficulty can be added by mixing the arms and legs movement, performing opposite extensions every rep (e.g. left arm extends out, so right leg extends out, and vice versa).\n Level 5: Double-leg extension  Deadbug Level 5: Double Leg Extension (a)\nFor further challenge to the core, both legs can be extended at the same time.\nDeadbug Error #2: Lumbar Extension (a)\n Level 6: Full layout  Deadbug Level 6: Full Layouts (a)\nThe final progression of the deadbug before you start to add external weight in the hands and feet is the Deadbug Lay-out. Both arms, both legs.\n Thoughts Notes  The Deadbug is without a doubt, the single most important core exercise out there, in my opinion. Through the process of learning and improving in deadbugs over time, you are not only:\n Working out \u0026lsquo;your core\u0026rsquo;, You will also be learning a lot about how to breathe properly (the way your body is \u0026ldquo;meant\u0026rdquo; to) and how that is related to core activation AND most importantly, you will learn how to coordinate all of your core muscles together to stabilise your mid-line (i.e. your spine and everything that moves when it moves) against resistance and even when your limbs are moving, which is incredibly important for bodyweight exercise and barbell training alike.  This process is referred to as \u0026lsquo;Bracing\u0026rsquo;.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIt takes a long time and a lot of practice to refine your control of your breathing and develop a fine and articulate command of your individual core muscles, so the sooner you start learning it in your journey, the sooner you can reap the benefits of it being performed correctly.\n Controlling your breathing  for our very first step, we are going to practice breathing only from the diaphragm, without making those accessory muscles do any work.\nTo do this, lie flat on your back with your knees up (you can also put your legs up on a chair, or your bed).\nPlace one hand on your upper chest (just below your neck, around your collarbones) and the other between the bottom of your ribs and your belly-button.\nNow try breathing, just normally as you would. What you might find is any of the following:\n Your upper hand moves up as you breathe in and down as you breathe out, but your lower hand does not (This means your accessory breathing muscles are working far too hard, and your diaphragm is working extremely inefficiently) Both your upper and lower hands both move up and down as you breathe in and out (The diaphragm is working more but the accessory muscles are still working when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) Your lower hand moves, but your upper hand does not (The diaphragm is working well, and the accessory muscles are relaxed as they should be)  We are aiming to achieve the third outcome there: The bottom hand should rise and fall as you breathe, but there should be no movement in the top hand, as seen below:\nDeadbug Level 0: Breath Control (a)\nYou may need to practice this for 5-10 minutes or even more to achieve this consistently, or you may be able to do it immediately. In any case, work on this until you can, then move on.\n(Extra credit: if you can do this perfectly, place both hands on the sides of your lower back and try again. If you can create expansion here too, your diaphragm is really firing on all cylinders, so to speak.)\n Bracing and the \u0026lsquo;Static Deadbug Hold\u0026rsquo;  The brace is, essentially, contracting almost everything all at once, so to brace, we will be simultaneously:\n Pushing the belly (and sides and back, if you\u0026rsquo;re good) out with the diaphragm (Full Brace Only*) Pulling the belly in with the transverse abdominis Drawing the sides together with the internal obliques Bringing the ribs down with the internal obliques, and optionally the rectus abdominis depending on the type of brace (or, at first, likely only the rectus abdominis)  [\u0026hellip;]\n   Full brace  The \u0026lsquo;Full\u0026rsquo; Brace is used during scenarios where you are manipulating vey heavy external loads, such as barbell training, picking up a sofa, or a heavy box. This is because in lifting heavy loads, it is very important (not only for your ability to express your strength to its fullest ability, but also for the safety of the movement on your back) that your spine stays rigid and unmoving in its chosen position. By having some air in your lungs, it really gives something for the brace to \u0026lsquo;bite down on\u0026rsquo;, so to speak.\nThe best way to explain this is with the analogy of a can of soda. If you push into the side of an open or empty can of soda, the can deforms very easily. You could probably bend it in half if you wanted to. This is what your back is like when you are not braced.\nHowever, if you tried to push into a closed can of soda, it would be much harder. This is because the liquid, and the gas inside of it, is pushing outwards against the walls of the can, stabilising it. That\u0026rsquo;s what a brace is like.\n  A FULL brace is like if you tried to push your thumb into the side of a can of soda you had just vigorously shaken up a few moments prior. All the gas has escaped from the liquid, and is pushing HARD against the can. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t dent that sucker if you tried.\n Empty brace  [\u0026hellip;] an empty brace takes the above concepts and uses them against the core muscles in order to force them to work harder. By bracing with absolutely minimal air in your lungs, your core has to contract and compress so much harder to find even 1/10 of the stability and tension.\n Is this not just a \u0026lsquo;Hollow Hold\u0026rsquo;?  If you are familiar with bodyweight fitness or gymnastics strength training, you may know of a common gymnastics core conditioning exercise known as the \u0026lsquo;hollow body hold\u0026rsquo;. Many people I\u0026rsquo;ve come into contact that fit this description are perplexed by the deadbug, often saying \u0026lsquo;so, basically a hollow hold, right?\u0026rsquo;. If you were to look at the starting progression of both, you would see they\u0026rsquo;re quite similar.\n  Hollow hold: Starting position\n    Deadbug: Starting position\n    However, when investigating their purpose, their internal cues, and their full end progressions, you can see a stark difference between them:\n  Full hollow: End position\n    Deadbug: End position\n    So looking at the end position, you can see that the hollow aims to achieve what is called a \u0026lsquo;globally flexed\u0026rsquo; position, as it is one of the two fundamental body shapes (The other being the \u0026lsquo;Arch Hold\u0026rsquo;, a globally extended position) that a gymnast needs to be able to maintain under high speeds of tumbling and flipping though the air in various apparati events.\nThis globally flexed position and lack of focus on internal cueing in favour of focus on external shape and rigid tension from the tips of the fingers to the tips of the toes means this exercise predominantly works the rectus abdominis, like many other core exercises.\nConversely, deadbugs are an exercise in full, complete, coordinated core bracing in a neutral (or slightly flexed in the lower back) spine position. The focus is very much on the brace, not necessarily on the shape, there is little to no tension in the limbs, and it is performed with an \u0026lsquo;empty brace\u0026rsquo; to maximally challenge the core. It is also not simply enough to replicate the look of deadbugs; if the transverse abdominis, or the internal obliques are not properly contracting for example, the deadbug is not being properly performed because the brace is not complete or coordinated.\n Flashcards Compare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 4 14.30 2023-08-03T22:21:58Z    Deadbug and hollow hold\nBack  Deadbug: emphasizes the empty brace, limbs are not under tension Hollow hold: focus on external shape and rigid tension  Source (Nick-E 2018)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Nick-E. 2018. “The Deadbug: Ultimate Guide to Mastering Core Strength.” Nick-E.Com. https://nick-e.com/deadbug/.

It tells us that when an expert encounters a problem in the wild, their brain observes the situation in a changing environment and immediately pattern matches it against a collection of prototypes. If they recognise what they see as an example of a prototype \u0026mdash; even if the situation they see is non-routine! \u0026mdash; their brain immediately generates four things:\n A set of \u0026lsquo;expectancies\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash; When diagnosing a situation, experts will construct mental simulations of how the events have been evolving and will continue to evolve. In other words, they will have some expectations for what happens next. The more experienced they are, the more clear-cut these expectancies become. For example, an experienced firefighter might take in a scene and know instantly where the fire might travel, or how a bad situation might develop. A programmer reading a codebase might find several weird kludges, and immediately suspect a submodule to be a persistent source of bugs. A set of plausible goals \u0026mdash; The expert would know what to prioritise in the moment, and what to defer to a latter time. When under fire, for instance, a Marine Corps squad leader would have to prioritise between keeping his people alive, getting to better cover, and achieving mission objectives. His recognised prototype tells him where his priorities lie in a given situation, freeing cognitive resources to conduct other forms of thinking. Similarly, a programmer may receive a set of business requirements, and immediately generate a prioritised list of goals in their head according to the recognised prototype. A set of relevant cues \u0026mdash; Experts know what to pay attention to; novices do not. Recognised prototypes come with a set of cues \u0026mdash; for instance, when you\u0026rsquo;ve just started driving, you may find yourself overwhelmed with the dials and knobs and mirrors you have to keep track of. After a few months, however, you do these things automatically, and shift your attention to specific affordances in your car depending on the situation. (For instance, when turning a corner, you know to check your side mirrors and you know what to watch out for.) An action script \u0026mdash; Last, but not least, if the situation is typical, the expert would have a course of action immediately generated in their heads. If the situation is not typical, the expert\u0026rsquo;s brain would still generate a set of actions, but the expert would slow down to walk through each action step in their head.  The recognition of goals, cues, expectancies and actions is part of what it means to recognise a situation. What is important to understand is that all of this recognition happens within implicit memory. This is why experts are not able to verbalise what they are doing.\nIMAGE\nImplicit memory operations are subconscious. Our ability to recognise faces, for instance, is an implicit memory operation, and we cannot say how it happens. When your friend Mary walks into the room, you immediately recognise her face. But notice that remembering her name is a different process entirely: this is because facial recognition is recognition; name retrieval is recall, and the two operations use different subsystems in your brain.

Let\u0026rsquo;s also say that you agree that tacit knowledge is mostly learnt through emulation, apprenticeship and osmosis.\nThe question that follows naturally is this: are there ways to get better at it? Is there research that tells us how to get better at emulation, or to be more effective at apprenticeship? I mentioned in my previous piece that the field of Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) [Naturalistic decision making] is the most promising subfield of expertise research I\u0026rsquo;ve found; I also mentioned that learning ideas and methods from NDM has made the biggest difference in my own pursuit of mastery.\n Two caveats  Let\u0026rsquo;s take a quick tour of all the ways \u0026lsquo;tacit knowledge\u0026rsquo; is confusing, just so you know that I am skipping over large parts of the philosophical literature:\n Tacit knowledge may be \u0026lsquo;embodied\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; that is, activities like riding a bike or swinging a tennis racquet have to do with the body, but not necessarily the conscious mind. Some philosophers believe that such skills are a type of tacit knowledge that is different from the tacit knowledge in more cerebral fields like programming and designing and writing. (I do not believe this is true, but the philosophical argument for why they believe this is the case will take around 50 pages of writing, so we\u0026rsquo;re not going to go there). Many types of tacit knowledge may be made explicit: for instance, bike riding or ball kicking may be turned into a collection of physics equations in a research paper. This is a form of explicit knowledge, and it may help you build a bike-riding or ball-kicking robot. But from a pedagogical perspective, this form of explicit knowledge is useless: it won\u0026rsquo;t help you learn to ride a bike or kick a ball. So is this really tacit knowledge? Or is it explicit? Or is it a bit of both? What about the kinds of tacit knowledge that can be communicated via video, or through pictures? I may not be able to explain to you how to do a complicated series of yoga poses through words alone, but if I record a quick video, or draw a series of diagrams, you might be able to learn to do so. Is such knowledge tacit, or explicit? And how about organisational tacit knowledge? In 1988, Taiichi Ohno published The Toyota Production System, which laid out the ideas behind lean manufacturing for the first time. He did so after resisting codification of those principles for many, many years; Ohno feared that the publication of TPS would destroy Toyota\u0026rsquo;s competitive advantage. But it turned out that the publication of Ohno\u0026rsquo;s book by itself did not lead to widespread adoption amongst Toyota\u0026rsquo;s competitors. More bizarrely, competitors who poached TPS experts away from Toyota were not able to replicate Toyota\u0026rsquo;s system in their company. It appeared that TPS required an organisational culture to develop alongside the implementation of the system itself. This phenomenon sparked off an entire subfield of research into organisational tacit knowledge.  I\u0026rsquo;ll skip ahead here and tell you that none of these questions are particularly interesting to me \u0026mdash; at least, not in the context of this blog. This blog is a practitioner\u0026rsquo;s blog: it is interested in what is useful, not what is \u0026lsquo;true\u0026rsquo;. [\u0026hellip;]\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my way of side-stepping everything above: when I say tacit knowledge in this series, what I am really interested in is \u0026lsquo;expert intuition\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;expert judgment\u0026rsquo;. This is the \u0026ldquo;expertise, full of caveats\u0026rdquo; that I talked about in Part 1 (a) [ (Chin 2020b) ]. Expert intuition is tacit because it is incredibly difficult to investigate, incredibly difficult to make explicit, and incredibly difficult to teach.\n How the naturalistic decision makers do it    [\u0026hellip;] \u0026lsquo;Cognitive Task Analysis\u0026rsquo; (CTA) [Cognitive task analysis]\n[\u0026hellip;] a set of interviewing techniques designed to explicate tacit mental models of expertise. This is not an easy task. An earlier version of this was called the \u0026lsquo;Critical Decision Method\u0026rsquo; [Critical decision method], which focused on \u0026lsquo;tough cases\u0026rsquo; of expertise-driven performance, in order to elicit whatever it is that was going on in the practitioners\u0026rsquo;s heads. Today, the set of techniques is much larger, and they are all lumped together under the umbrella of CTA.\nIf you study the development of psych approaches, CTA is simply an extension of older techniques used by the behaviourists to analyse psychological effects under experimental conditions. (Paul Harmon, for instance, talks about this evolution here (a)). NDM researchers typically perform cognitive task analysis at the outset of their projects \u0026mdash; this is how they extract tacit knowledge from the experts they study.\n  [\u0026hellip;] a model of expert intuition called the recognition-primed decision making model (RPD) [Recognition-primed decision making model].\nThis model, developed by Gary Klein and his collaborators in the 90s, lies at the heart of their understanding of expert intuition. RPD explains how expert intuition works, and it tells us why experts have so much difficulty when it comes to explaining their expertise. NDM practitioners use the RPD model as a guide during their interviewing process, and they also use it as a guide to the development of their training programs.\n  NDM researchers develop training programs designed to let less experienced practitioners acquire expert judgment of their own. NDM practitioners typically have some familiarity with pedagogical techniques, but in this, they, too, are guided by the RPD model.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s a common misconception to look at this and think: \u0026ldquo;oh, when you can make tacit knowledge explicit, then you can just explain things to people and they will get it.\u0026rdquo; This is not the right conclusion to have. As we shall soon see, large portions of expertise is tacit, and for certain types of expertise, the training methods must also be tacit in nature \u0026mdash; that is, built around copying, and emulation, and scenario training, not explicit instruction. What NDM gives us is a rigorous method to reason about such things.\n[formatting mine]\n The Recognition-primed decision making model See Recognition-primed decision making model\nFlashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2020a. “Copying Better: How To Acquire The Tacit Knowledge of Experts.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/. ———. 2020b. “Why Tacit Knowledge Is More Important Than Deliberate Practice.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/.

[\u0026hellip;] like music and math and chess\u0026rdquo;.\n  Thoughts Notes What is tacit knowledge? See Tacit knowledge.\n Think about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you\u0026rsquo;re doing when you\u0026rsquo;re cycling, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be of much help when you\u0026rsquo;re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you\u0026rsquo;re telling them to \u0026ldquo;BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!\u0026rdquo;.\nUndoubtedly there will be people who say that if you just explain better, if you could find the right words to talk to your students, you can teach them to ride bikes. If you happen to believe this … well, I urge you to test this theory yourself. Go find a couple of kids (or adults!) who haven\u0026rsquo;t yet learned to ride a bike and see if you can teach them \u0026mdash; through the power of your explanations alone! \u0026mdash; how to cycle without scraping their shins. And if you are successful, be critical with yourself: how much of your success is due to the bike rider figuring it out on their own? And how much of it is due to your verbal instructions?\nThis explanation bit deserves some attention. In pedagogy, this is known as \u0026lsquo;transmissionism (a)\u0026rsquo;, and it is regarded amongst serious educators with the same sort of derision you and I might have about flat-earth theories today. It goes something like this: some people believe that it is possible to teach technique by explaining things to others. They think that if you can find just the right combinations of words with the right sorts of analogies; if you can really break things down into the right level of atomic details, things will magically click in their students\u0026rsquo;s heads and they will succeed. [\u0026hellip;]\nHow do you teach tacit knowledge? How do you teach bike riding, for that matter?\nWhen I was a kid, I taught myself how to ride a bike … by accident. And then I taught my sisters and then my cousin and then another kid in the neighbourhood who was interested but a little scared. They were zooming around in about an hour each. The steps were as follows:\n Pick a small bike, much smaller than the body of your learner, and therefore not far off the ground. This is useful for the learner because they will be able to put their feet down and save themselves at any moment. It\u0026rsquo;s also less scary to be not far off the ground. Have them push with their legs and go forward a short distance, again with their feet only inches off the ground. Do this repeatedly, by pushing off, putting both feet down, then stopping and repeating. Make the pushes harder and the distances longer. Eventually, they will spend tens of seconds gliding with their feet held up. The goal here is have them learn how it feels like to balance on a bike. On one of those glides, once they feel ready (and likely a little bored \u0026mdash; the point is to get them to do step 3 so many times that they\u0026rsquo;re feeling secure and eager to move on) \u0026mdash; well, once you reach that point, tell them to start peddling. Voilà. You have a bicycling kid.  Notice how little verbal instruction is involved. What is more important is emulation, and action \u0026mdash; that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.\nIn other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.\n Tacit knowledge in knowledge work  In my previous job, my technical lead, Hieu, had an uncanny ability to sit in on requirements meetings and, within minutes, sketch out a program structure that would be the simplest possible solution with the fewest moving parts. That sketch was often the one we ended up implementing, and yet I noticed that Hieu always left enough wiggle room for the inevitable changes that came with any software project. (To be clear, he usually implemented a throwaway prototype to confirm the sketch, before passing on the design). When I designed implementations, something always had to be redesigned later. I simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good. Eventually, I asked him how he did this, and tried multiple times to get it out of him over the years we worked together. Our conversations would inevitably go something like the following:\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026rdquo; Hieu would begin, \u0026ldquo;When you hear there is an external API, you should focus your program around that because there is a lot of risk there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah but then why didn\u0026rsquo;t you worry about the calendar API?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, because I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with it before and I think it is easy to implement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why focus so much on Firebase?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because we want to use it as a database layer. Quite risky ah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So always focus on a core layer first, because more important?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes. Try to focus on the most dangerous bits first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But how come you didn\u0026rsquo;t worry about the inventory API? We\u0026rsquo;ve never integrated with that before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ya that one not that important now I think. The client might change it later. Or maybe our feature is going to change. We do the basics first.\u0026rdquo;\nI thought back to my Viki days, when I was a software engineering intern and was writing software tests for the first time. A senior software engineer took a few seconds to look at about a hundred lines of code I\u0026rsquo;d written, and said \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not good, this would be a problem later. Structure it this way.\u0026rdquo;\nI asked him how he knew, within five seconds, that it was bad. He gave me a long explanation about software engineering principles. I waved him away and asked how he did it in five seconds. He said \u0026ldquo;Well, it just felt right. Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s go to lunch, you can fix it afterwards.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written about this Viki episode in my post about perceptual learning. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to say that Hieu or the senior software engineer couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain their judgment, or that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t make explicit the principles they used to evaluate the tradeoffs between a dozen or so variables: they could, even if terribly. My point is that their explanations would not lead me to the same ability that they had.\nWhy is this the case? Well, take a look at the conversation again. When I pushed these people on their judgments, they would try to explain in terms of principles or heuristics. But the more I pushed, the more exceptions and caveats and potential gotchas I unearthed.\nThis is actually generalisable. People with expertise in any sufficiently complicated domain will always explain their expertise with things like: \u0026ldquo;Well, do X. Except when you see Y, then do Z, because A. And if you see B, then do P. But if you see A and C but not B, then do Q, because reason D. And then there are weird situations where you do Z but then see thing C emerge, then you should switch to Q.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd if you push further, eventually they might say \u0026ldquo;Ahh, it just feels right. Do it long enough and it\u0026rsquo;ll feel right to you too.\u0026rdquo;\nEventually I realised that the way to learn Hieu\u0026rsquo;s techniques was to copy him: to design some software and then ask for his feedback. And I realised that if you ever hear someone explaining things in terms of a long list of caveats, the odds are good that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at tacit knowledge in action.\nThis phenomenon is actually well established in the study of expertise. It has also been written about, many times, by practitioners in other fields. As an example, here\u0026rsquo;s surgeon Atul Gawande on appendicitis surgery:\nSay you\u0026rsquo;ve got a patient who needs surgery for appendicitis. These days, surgeons will typically do a laparoscopic appendectomy. You slide a small camera—a laparoscope—into the abdomen through a quarter-inch incision near the belly button, insert a long grasper through an incision beneath the waistline, and push a device for stapling and cutting through an incision in the left lower abdomen. Use the grasper to pick up the finger-size appendix, fire the stapler across its base and across the vessels feeding it, drop the severed organ into a plastic bag, and pull it out. Close up, and you\u0026rsquo;re done. That\u0026rsquo;s how you like it to go, anyway. But often it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nEven before you start, you need to make some judgments. Unusual anatomy, severe obesity, or internal scars from previous abdominal surgery could make it difficult to get the camera in safely; you don\u0026rsquo;t want to poke it into a loop of intestine. You have to decide which camera-insertion method to use—there\u0026rsquo;s a range of options—or whether to abandon the high-tech approach and do the operation the traditional way, with a wide-open incision that lets you see everything directly. If you do get your camera and instruments inside, you may have trouble grasping the appendix. Infection turns it into a fat, bloody, inflamed worm that sticks to everything around it—bowel, blood vessels, an ovary, the pelvic sidewall—and to free it you have to choose from a variety of tools and techniques. You can use a long cotton-tipped instrument to try to push the surrounding attachments away. You can use electrocautery, a hook, a pair of scissors, a sharp-tip dissector, a blunt-tip dissector, a right-angle dissector, or a suction device. You can adjust the operating table so that the patient\u0026rsquo;s head is down and his feet are up, allowing gravity to pull the viscera in the right direction. Or you can just grab whatever part of the appendix is visible and pull really hard.\nOnce you have the little organ in view, you may find that appendicitis was the wrong diagnosis. It might be a tumor of the appendix, Crohn\u0026rsquo;s disease, or an ovarian condition that happened to have inflamed the nearby appendix. Then you\u0026rsquo;d have to decide whether you need additional equipment or personnel—maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to enlist another surgeon.\nOver time, you learn how to head off problems, and, when you can\u0026rsquo;t, you arrive at solutions with less fumbling and more assurance. After eight years, I\u0026rsquo;ve performed more than two thousand operations. Three-quarters have involved my specialty, endocrine surgery—surgery for endocrine organs such as the thyroid, the parathyroid, and the adrenal glands. The rest have involved everything from simple biopsies to colon cancer. For my specialized cases, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to know most of the serious difficulties that could arise, and have worked out solutions. For the others, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained confidence in my ability to handle a wide range of situations, and to improvise when necessary.\n Notice how Gawande includes all sorts of caveats in his explanation of his expertise. This is probably tacit knowledge in action. Learning this type of complicated judgment — this instantaneous solution selection that happens to balance dozens of considerations against each other — this is what is valuable to learn. And it is almost impossible to learn it through explanation alone.\n Can tacit knowledge be made explicit?  It is worth it to re-examine that last sentence, above. Could it \u0026mdash; in principle \u0026mdash; be possible to externalise tacit knowledge into a list of instructions? [\u0026hellip;]\nThe consensus answer to that question seems to be: \u0026ldquo;Yes, in principle it is possible to do so. In practice it is very difficult.\u0026rdquo; My take on this is that it is so difficult that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even bother; assuming that you are reading this because you want to get good in your career, you should give up on turning tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and just go after tacit knowledge itself.\nWhy do we know this?\nIn the 1970s, a bunch of organisations \u0026mdash; amongst them the US military \u0026mdash; commissioned a number of studies to look into the possibility of building out all sorts of expert systems to augment or replace human agents. [\u0026hellip;]\nWhat many researchers found in the wake of that fad was that it is extremely difficult to encode all the possible branches and gotchas and nuances from a human expert into an expert system.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n(Wikipedia calls this problem the \u0026lsquo;knowledge acquisition problem (a)\u0026rsquo;, which is a nice way of putting it; it was what ultimately caused expert systems to decline in popularity). As people rapidly discovered, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so easy to get the \u0026lsquo;rules\u0026rsquo; out of experts\u0026rsquo;s heads in the first place.\nBut there are other objections, of course. Klein \u0026mdash; now considered one of the pioneers of the Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) [Naturalistic decision making] branch of psychology \u0026mdash; likes to say that over-reliance on procedures makes human operators fragile (Chapter 15, Source of Power (a)). In other words, giving people a list of procedures to execute, blindly [or via Learned blankness], denies them the ability to build expertise, which in turns prevents them from doing the sorts of creative problem solving that is common amongst expert operators. It also means that when something goes drastically wrong \u0026mdash; and something always goes drastically wrong in the real world \u0026mdash; they would not be able to adapt.\n Learning tacit knowledge  \u0026ldquo;But wait,\u0026rdquo; I hear you say \u0026mdash; \u0026ldquo;What about the field of deliberate practice? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the predominant subfield most concerned with the development of expertise?\u0026rdquo; And the answer to that is no, it is not.\nIn my review of Ericssons' Peak (a) [ TODO: Add citation for peak. ], and in my summary of The Problems with Deliberate Practice (a) [ (Chin 2019) ], I explained that deliberate practice is defined as possible only in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice can only exist in fields like music and math and chess.\n Anders Ericsson lays out this narrow definition in Peak, and then does a cop-out, arguing that while he hasn\u0026rsquo;t studied practice outside of such domains, the ideas from deliberate practice may be applied to pedagogically less established fields. But Ericsson is well aware that NDM methods exist \u0026mdash; he was one of the editors, alongside many names from the NDM community \u0026mdash; who worked on the Cambridge Handbook for Expertise and Expert Performance (a).  And so if you are a programmer, or designer, or businessperson, an investor or a writer reading about deliberate practice, you may be asking: \u0026ldquo;Well, what about my field? What if there are no established pedagogical techniques for me?\u0026rdquo; And if you have started to ask this question, then you have begun travelling a more interesting path; this is really the right question to ask.\nThe answer, of course, is that the field of NDM is a lot more useful if you find yourself in one of these fields. The process of learning tacit knowledge looks something like the following: you find a master, you work under them for a few years, and you learn the ropes through emulation, feedback, and osmosis \u0026mdash; not through deliberate practice. (Think: Warren Buffett and the years he spent under Benjamin Graham, for instance). The field of NDM is focused on ways to make this practice more effective. And I think much of the world pays too much attention to deliberate practice and to cognitive bias research, and not enough to tacit knowledge acquisition.\nIf tacit knowledge exists \u0026mdash; and I believe it does \u0026mdash; then the most useful tools about skill acquisition will come out of the fields that study it. Late last year, the NDM community got together and published The Oxford Handbook of Expertise (a). It is the single most comprehensive overview of the field that we know today.\n Add citation for peak Cite Cambridge handbook for expertise and expert performance Cite oxford handbook of expertise Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 4 14.22 2023-07-26T18:08:02Z   1 2.35 4 12.73 2023-08-02T08:46:21Z    {{Tacit knowledge}@0} looks like {{an explanation with a list of caveats}@1}.\nSource (Chin 2020)\nCompare and contrast (Cedric Chin)    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 4 16.41 2023-07-30T10:40:39Z    Tacit knowledge and Deliberate practice\nBack  Deliberate practice is only possible in domains with long pedagogical histories (e.g. math or music) Tacit knowledge exists in all domains, is difficult to scale, but is more useful  Source (Chin 2020)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2019. “Book Summary: Peak, the New Science of Expertise.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/peak-book-summary/. ———. 2020. “Why Tacit Knowledge Is More Important Than Deliberate Practice.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/.

We may not be able to accelerate expertise. It may take, let\u0026rsquo;s say, ten years for someone to become an expert despite our acceleration efforts (see accelerated proficiency curve in notes below).  What doesn\u0026rsquo;t work?  Establish and a skill hierarchy composed of atomised skills/techniques Teach the skills in a classroom-like setting Include some form of testing to measure learning Generally speaking: the typical classroom Pedagogy  Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it work?  It\u0026rsquo;s slow; both to create and to update Learners are prone to develop understandings, Mental models, with subtle flaws. These flaws prevent the acquisition of a fully-true mental model. Atomised understanding doesn\u0026rsquo;t generalize to real-world ability; The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something Learners may not internalize the ways in which the atomic skills they were taught fit together (e.g. learning the names of ten cities in France but not being able to find them on a map)  What works?    Identify the domain experts\n  Perform cognitive task analysis [Cognitive task analysis] on these identified experts to extract their expertise\n  As you do step 2, you will be building a case library of difficult cases. Store these cases, and code them according to measures of difficulty.\n  Turn your case library into a set of training simulations\nThis step is a bit of an art \u0026mdash; the researchers say that \u0026lsquo;no set of generalised principles currently exist for designing a good simulation\u0026rsquo;. They know that cognitive fidelity to the real world is key \u0026mdash; but how good must the fidelity be? Training programs here span from full virtual simulations (using VR headsets) to pen-and-paper decision making exercises (called Tactical Decision-making Games) employed by the Marines.\nSome training programs are designed so that learners are required to perform sensemaking on their own \u0026mdash; that is, to introspect and reflect on what they\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from each simulation. Others include feedback from a more experienced practitioner, or one that has been identified as an \u0026lsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; in step 1.\nSome training programs may present abstract or generalised principles up front, which are then emphasised through training simulation. For instance, the Marines have a heuristic for when battlefield plans break down: \u0026ldquo;keep moving, seek the high ground, stay in touch.\u0026rdquo; This is taught explicitly.\nFeedback in simulation training is sometimes qualitative and multi-factorial. Some exercises like Gary Klein\u0026rsquo;s Shadowbox method ask multiple-choice question at critical decision points during a presented scenario (e.g., \u0026lsquo;at this point of the cardiac arrest (freeze-frame the video), what cues do you consider important?'). Learners then compare their answers to an experts\u0026rsquo;s, and then reflect on what they missed. Other forms of feedback are less clear-cut. US Marine Tactical Decision-making Games are conducted on pen-and-paper in a group environment, with one or two more experienced commanders. Feedback is organic and emerges from the group discussion. Lia DiBello\u0026rsquo;s Strategic Rehearsals (a) are performed in a group setting within the business, and simply give participants a list of three questions to discuss after a failed simulation: (1) what went wrong, (2) what we will do differently this time, and (3) how will we know it is working? Sometimes this is paired with a constructive exercise, facilitated by the trainers.\n  Test the program: run your learners through your set of training simulations, ranging from simple to difficult\n  [paraphrased, formatting mine]\n Why does it work?  Cognitive flexibility theory Cognitive transformation theory  Thoughts Notes  This is a summary of a remarkable 🌳 tree book (a) [Tree book], which presents a theory for and methods to accelerate expertise in real-world contexts. This summary is not comprehensive; it only covers some of the actionable theories and recommendations in the book and leaves out the considerable lit review and the book\u0026rsquo;s recommendations for future research directions. I\u0026rsquo;ll note that Accelerated Expertise (a) is not written for the lay person \u0026mdash; it is a book primarily written for organisational psychologists, training program designers and researchers employed in the US military. If you must read it \u0026mdash; say because you want to put the ideas in the book to practice \u0026mdash; my recommendation is to read Chapters 9-13 and skim everything else.\nAccelerated Expertise is about \u0026lsquo;taking the concept of skill development to the limit\u0026rsquo;. This is not a book about pure theory; nor is this a book about deliberate practice (a) in well-developed skill domains. No: this is a book that pushes the limits of two lesser-known learning theories, and in so doing have created successful accelerated training programs in messy, real-world military and industrial contexts.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the US Air Force Research Laboratory convened a series of working meetings on \u0026lsquo;accelerated expertise and facilitated retention\u0026rsquo;, and invited a number of Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) researchers, expertise researchers, and military organisational psychologists to attend. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe report (a) that come out of those meetings became the precursor to Accelerated Expertise (a) [\u0026hellip;]\n   Accelerated Expertise is divided into three parts. Part 1 presents a literature review of the entire expertise research landscape circa 2016. Part 2 presents several demonstrations of successful accelerated training programs, and then an underlying theory for why those training programs work so well. Part 2 also contains a generalised structure for creating these accelerated expertise training programs. Part 3 presents a research agenda for the future, and unifies Parts 1 and 2 by pointing out all the holes in the empirical base on which existing accelerated training programs have been built.\nThis summary will focus on Part 2.\n What the military wanted  The military wanted two things:\n It wanted new training methods and learning technologies that could accelerate the achievement of high levels of proficiency. (Note: proficiency is different from expertise \u0026mdash; we\u0026rsquo;ll return to this in a moment). It wanted high retention of knowledge and skill. This latter requirement was due to the organisational nature of the military \u0026mdash; it is common for military personnel to be temporarily reassigned to administrative duty for a few years in the middle of active service. For example, an Air Force pilot might be reassigned to teaching duty at an academy for a year or two before returning to the field. The Department of Defence wanted to reduce the amount of retraining necessary to get these pilots up to speed. It tasked researchers to come up with new methods or new research agendas for these problems.  Over the course of the two meetings, it became clear that the requirements from the military could be broken down into four granular subgoals, all of which were important for both military and for industry applications:\n Methods to quicken the training process while maintaining its effectiveness (Rapidised Training). Methods to rapidise the transposition of lessons learnt from the battlespace into the training context \u0026mdash; for instance, if insurgents evolve their tactics, there should be a way to rapidly integrate this \u0026lsquo;meta (a)\u0026rsquo; [ (Chin 2020a) ] into existing training programs. (Rapidised Knowledge Sharing). Methods to train more quickly to higher levels of proficiency (Accelerated Proficiency) and Methods to insure that training has a stable and lasting effect (Facilitated Retention)  The training approach that they present in Part 2 of the book fulfil many of the four requirements above.\nThe reason there is a difference between \u0026lsquo;proficiency\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;expertise\u0026rsquo; is that the authors do not know if it is possible to accelerate \u0026lsquo;high proficiency\u0026rsquo; (sometimes called \u0026lsquo;mastery\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;expertise\u0026rsquo;). In their report, the authors write:\nThe goal of accelerated learning calls out an important practical tension. On the one hand is the notion that we must accelerate learning; that is, increase the rate at which highly proficient performance is achieved. On the other hand, there is a significant amount of evidence that developing expertise requires up to 10 years of experience, including practice at tough tasks (Hoffman, 1998 (a)). This suggests that it is not possible to accelerate the achievement of high proficiency. A prime goal of the DoD Accelerated Learning Technology Focus Team is to identify critical research challenges that are currently underfunded or not funded, and generate a notional roadmap for science and technology advancement.\n They conclude, tentatively, that perhaps it is only possible to accelerate proficiency between senior apprentice and junior journeyman levels (or between senior journeyman and junior expert levels). They present the following stylised growth curve:\n  Perhaps, the authors say, overall mastery still takes 10 years in the field, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do about that.\nBut what we do know is this: the set of successful accelerated training programs that currently exist enable accelerated proficiency, not accelerated mastery.\nAnd perhaps that is good enough!\n How to accelerate expertise?  Let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that you are a training program designer. You need to get a bunch of novices to competency in a short amount of time. What would you do?\nMost of us would first ask: what is the skill tree for this domain? To which the researchers say: No. Stop. Screw all of that.\nI think most of us would first ask: what is the skill tree for this domain? We would attempt to figure out a set of atomised skills and lay them out from the most basic skills to the most advanced, and then design a training syllabus to teach each skill in the right order, making sure to teach the pre-requisites first, and then incrementally complexify our taught concepts and skills and training programs. We would probably also design exercises for the lower levels of skills, and attempt to create intermediate assessment tasks or \u0026lsquo;tests\u0026rsquo;.\nWe would, in short, attempt to replicate how we are taught in school.\nThe researchers say: No. Stop. Screw all of that.\nThere are a number of problems with this training approach. You might be familiar with some of them.\n First, this approach to training just takes too damn long. It is, after all, the mainstream approach to pedagogy [Pedagogy], and it is this very paradigm that the researchers were asked to improve. A more interesting question is why it takes too damn long. There are two answers to this question. First, humans learn by constructing mental models [Mental model] of a domain. In the beginning, these mental models are crude and do not result in effective action. So novices evolve them rapidly by constructing, discarding, and re-constructing mental models in response to feedback. At some point, however, these mental models become effective enough and complex enough that they become knowledge shields (a) [ (Chin 2021c) ] \u0026mdash; that is, mental models of a domain that are wrong in subtle ways, that prevent students from reaching higher levels of expertise because they enable them to reject anomalous data. In other words, breaking a skill domain down to atomised skills is risky \u0026mdash; it is likely that you will accidentally cause the construction of subtly wrong mental models, due to the incomplete nature of a skill hierarchy. This then slows expertise development, since trainers would now have to do additional work \u0026mdash; for instance, you would have to design your training tasks to include \u0026lsquo;knowledge shield destruction\u0026rsquo; as a pedagogical goal. Better to avoid this completely. Breaking a skill domain down into a discrete learning hierarchy is bad for one other reason: experts are able to see connections and draw links between concepts or cues that novices cannot. Teaching atomised concepts will prevent novices from learning these connections, and may in fact result in either subpar performance or a training plateau later on. (Note: this is not a universal recommendation; the authors note that The Simplifying Conditions Method, as demonstrated by Kim \u0026amp; Reigeluth is one way to break a domain down while emphasising connections between concepts, but this pedagogical method is not universally known. Better to do without this requirement altogether). The second reason a hierarchical training approach sucks is that assessments for atomised skills do not translate to assessments of real world performance. I think we know this intuitively. Tests for basic skills often do not capture the nuances of skill application in real world environments. You can test well in corporate finance and then run a company to the ground, because you do not know what cues to look for in the particular business you\u0026rsquo;re in. The third reason this training approach sucks is that atomised training often does not have high cognitive fidelity to the context of use. Take, for instance, \u0026lsquo;Cognitive Load Theory\u0026rsquo;. This is a famous theory of classroom learning, and it basically says that \u0026lsquo;intrinsic cognitive load\u0026rsquo; is related to the complexity of the learning task itself; \u0026lsquo;extraneous cognitive load\u0026rsquo; is caused by activities during learning that are unnecessary and interfere with schema acquisition. The teacher\u0026rsquo;s job is to design teaching methods that reduce extraneous cognitive load. The authors point out that this is all well and good when your student needs to take a test, but if your work environment involves bombs dropping on you while you plan your troop movements, perhaps your training program should also include some \u0026lsquo;extraneous cognitive load\u0026rsquo;? The fourth reason this training approach sucks is that it is not easy to update the training program if the skill domain changes. This is an important requirement in both business and in military contexts \u0026mdash; you might imagine that if the market environment changes (in business), or if insurgents evolve their IED (a) tactics, you would need to quickly update your training program. But a hierarchical syllabus resists updating. Which lesson do you update? At what level of complexity? What pre-requisites must change? There are too many moving parts. It should be easier to update training. Meanwhile, soldiers get deployed to the frontlines without updated training and die. The fifth reason this training approach sucks is that external assessments often degrade the learner\u0026rsquo;s ability to sensemake in the field. In other words, extremely clear feedback sometimes prevents students from learning effectively from experience (a) [ (Chin 2021c) ], which may slow their learning when they arrive in a real world domain.  So what do you do? What do you do if you can\u0026rsquo;t design a hierarchical skill tree? What do you do if incremental complexification is off the table?\nThe answer: you cheat.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve talked about the Naturalistic Decision Making branch of psychology in the past. The NDM field contains methods to extract tacit mental models of expertise. These methods are loosely categorised under the name \u0026lsquo;cognitive task analysis\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;CTA\u0026rsquo;, and have been developed over a 30 year period in applied domains. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about NDM in my tacit knowledge series (a) [ (Chin 2020b) ], and I\u0026rsquo;ve written about ACTA, the simplest form of CTA here (a) [ (chin 2021) ] and here (a) [ (Chin 2021b) ]. I recommend that you read them both.\nOnce you have an explicated mental model of the expertise you desire, you may ask a simpler question: what kind of simulations may I design to provoke the construction of those mental models in the heads of my students?\nWhat CTA allows you to do is to extract the actual mental model of expertise that experts have in their heads. This allows you to sidestep the problem of good hierarchical skill tree design. Once you have an explicated mental model of the expertise you desire, you may ask a simpler question: what kind of simulations may I design to provoke the construction of those mental models in the heads of my students?\nThis core insight underpins many of the successful accelerated expertise training programs in use today.\nWith that in mind, this is the general structure of an accelerated expertise training program, as recommended by the book:\n Identify who the domain experts are. The book gives you four methods for expert identification \u0026mdash; (1) in depth career interviews about education, training and job experiences, (2) professional standards or licensing, (3) measures of actual performance at familiar tasks, and finally (4) social interaction analysis (asking groups of practitioners who is a master at what). Perform cognitive task analysis on these identified experts to extract their expertise. Depending on the exact CTA method you use, this step will initially take a few months, and require multiple interviews with multiple experts (and also with some novices) in order to perform good extraction. As you do step 2, you will be building a case library of difficult cases. Store these cases, and code them according to measures of difficulty. You may ask experts to help you with the coding. Next, turn your case library into a set of training simulations. This step is a bit of an art \u0026mdash; the researchers say that \u0026lsquo;no set of generalised principles currently exist for designing a good simulation\u0026rsquo;. They know that cognitive fidelity to the real world is key \u0026mdash; but how good must the fidelity be? Training programs here span from full virtual simulations (using VR headsets) to pen-and-paper decision making exercises (called Tactical Decision-making Games) employed by the Marines. Some training programs are designed so that learners are required to perform sensemaking on their own \u0026mdash; that is, to introspect and reflect on what they\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from each simulation. Others include feedback from a more experienced practitioner, or one that has been identified as an \u0026lsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; in step 1. Some training programs may present abstract or generalised principles up front, which are then emphasised through training simulation. For instance, the Marines have a heuristic for when battlefield plans break down: \u0026ldquo;keep moving, seek the high ground, stay in touch.\u0026rdquo; This is taught explicitly. Finally, test the program: run your learners through your set of training simulations, ranging from simple to difficult. This also requires some amount of tweaking \u0026mdash; the authors note that \u0026lsquo;difficulty\u0026rsquo; in a domain is complex, and it may take some trial and error to figure out a good ordering of cases, or a good categorisation scheme (more advanced learners should be assigned more difficult cases, or you risk constructing or reinforcing knowledge shields). Feedback in simulation training is sometimes qualitative and multi-factorial. Some exercises like Gary Klein\u0026rsquo;s Shadowbox method ask multiple-choice question at critical decision points during a presented scenario (e.g., \u0026lsquo;at this point of the cardiac arrest (freeze-frame the video), what cues do you consider important?'). Learners then compare their answers to an experts\u0026rsquo;s, and then reflect on what they missed. Other forms of feedback are less clear-cut. US Marine Tactical Decision-making Games are conducted on pen-and-paper in a group environment, with one or two more experienced commanders. Feedback is organic and emerges from the group discussion. Lia DiBello\u0026rsquo;s Strategic Rehearsals (a) are performed in a group setting within the business, and simply give participants a list of three questions to discuss after a failed simulation: (1) what went wrong, (2) what we will do differently this time, and (3) how will we know it is working? Sometimes this is paired with a constructive exercise, facilitated by the trainers.  We\u0026rsquo;ll get into a real world example in a bit, but I want to call out a few remarkable things about this approach:\n Notice how case libraries and simulations may be easily updated. If the battlespace changes, training program designers that are proficient in CTA may be deployed to the frontlines to do skill extraction, and then return to turn those into additional training simulations. Skill retention is very compatible with this approach \u0026mdash; experienced practitioners may be put on a spaced-repetition program where they do periodic training simulations. Alternatively, if the practitioner is not able to do training simulations (perhaps because they are assigned to a location that is too far away from a training facility), an alternative is to perform \u0026lsquo;over-training\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; that is, intensive simulation training right before he or she is reassigned, which results in a more gentle skill drop-off rate. There are two caveats to this: first, spaced repetition has mostly been shown to work for knowledge retention, not skill retention; second, in general, studies tell us that skills tend to be retained for a longer period than knowledge. The authors note that we currently lack a good empirical base for skill retention. Not doing basic skill training seems excessive \u0026mdash; but the authors note that training simulations do not preclude teaching basic skills. A common reaction to this training approach is to say \u0026ldquo;wait, but novices will feel lost and overwhelmed if they have no basic conceptual training and are instead thrown into real world tasks!\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; and this is certainly a valid concern. To be fair, the book\u0026rsquo;s approach may be combined with some form of atomised skill training up front. But it\u0026rsquo;s worth asking if a novice\u0026rsquo;s feeling of artificial progression is actually helpful, if the progression comes at the expense of real world performance. The authors basically shrug this off and say (I\u0026rsquo;m paraphrasing): \u0026ldquo;well, do you want accelerated expertise or not?\u0026rdquo; In more formal learning science terms, this \u0026lsquo;overwhelming\u0026rsquo; feeling is probably best seen as a \u0026lsquo;desirable difficulty (a)\u0026rsquo; [Desirable difficulty], and may be an acceptable price to pay for acceleration. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that sensemaking plays a key part in many of their training programs. Simulation training gives trainers the option of asking students to perform \u0026mdash; and therefore learn from \u0026mdash; sensemaking, instead of seeking explicit feedback. This is not always doable, but is generally a good idea, since skill mastery in real world domains emerges from effective reflection. As such, many training programs guide learners to reflect on dynamic, messy feedback.  There are many other interesting ideas that I cannot get into, for the sake of brevity. For instance, one fascinating comment, presented in Chapter 14, is the idea that case libraries may serve as the basis of \u0026lsquo;organisational knowledge management\u0026rsquo;:\nCase experience is so important to the achievement of proficiency that it can be assumed that organisations would need very large case repositories for use in training (and also to preserve organisational memory). Instruction using cases is greatly enhanced when \u0026ldquo;just the right case\u0026rdquo; or set of cases can be engaged at a prime learning moment for a learner (Kolodner, 1993). This also argues for a need for large numbers of cases, to cover many contingencies. Creating and maintaining case libraries is a matter of organisation among cases, good retrieval schemes, and smart indexing\u0026mdash;all so that \u0026ldquo;lessons learned\u0026rdquo; do not become \u0026ldquo;lessons forgotten.\u0026rdquo;\n The US Marines, for instance, own a large and growing library of \u0026lsquo;Tactical Decision-Making Games\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;TDGs\u0026rsquo;, built from various real or virtual battlefield scenarios; these represent a corpus of the collective operational expertise of the Marines Corps.\nThe authors note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to military applications. Take, for instance, the domain of power generation, where one of the authors was tasked with a project on capturing tacit expertise in a retiring workforce:\nIt is easy to acquire and instil \u0026ldquo;middle of the bell curve\u0026rdquo; knowledge (in an electric utilities company), but at an electric plant there will be, say, five out of 1500 people who are irreplaceable. When (not if) the need arises, much effort is required to transpose high-end technical wisdom to a few specified individuals who are mission-critical in that their value lies at the fringes of some particular discipline (e.g., individuals who keep the company out of the newspaper; individuals who make sure the lights do not go out at Giant Stadium on Monday night). The high-end or \u0026ldquo;franchise experts\u0026rdquo; sometimes change the mission and thereby make the total organization resilient (Hoffman et al., 2011). For example, when a fire started in a relay station building that had lots of asbestos, the expert\u0026rsquo;s novel solution was to seal off the building, flush the insides into one single storm drain and grab the debris from there. The process took a couple of weeks (vs. many weeks), it protected the public and the environment, and it kept the incident out of the newspapers.\nWhile expertise may be acquired in around 10 years, typically it takes 25-35 years to achieve very high-end proficiency. This is related, in part, not just to the frequency of meaningful real-world experiences that could be leveraged to further skill acquisition, but to the complexity of the domain and the longevity of the technology. (For instance, only recently have utilities begun the change from analog controls to digital controls.) Many stories are told of the engineering challenges in New York City. Engineers have to maintain and integrate numerous subsystems built in different eras. A senior relay system protection engineer retired, and was replaced by four engineers, each having had 10 years of experience. That did not suffice. (emphasis added) When a car hit a pole and two lines tripped, both lines were lost. Across the two lines there were dozens of different kinds of relays and dozens of different kinds of relay protection schemes, some 50 years old. The retired engineer had to be brought back in to fix this emergency situation.\n In other words, what serves as a difficult case library for training may also double as a store of expertise.\n The underlying theory  In Chapter 11, the authors assert that two core learning theories underpin their training approach, and may be combined:\n Cognitive Flexibility Theory [Cognitive flexibility theory], or CFT, and Cognitive Transformation Theory [Cognitive transformation theory], or CTT  I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about CTT in the past, which you may read about here (a) [ (Chin 2021c) ] and here (a) [ (Chin 2021a) ]. This is the summary of both theories that the book presents:\nPertinent theories related to the acquisition and acceleration of expertise can be thought of as sets of hypotheses or postulates, which could be combined or merged, as we do in the following discussion of Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT) (Spiro et al., 1988, 1992) and Cognitive Transformation Theory (CTT) (Klein, 1997; Klein \u0026amp; Baxter, 2009). These two theories have the greatest relevance to empirical data collected on domains of cognitive work in the \u0026ldquo;real world.\u0026rdquo;\n Because the two theories share the same core syllogisms, especially around mental model formation and knowledge shields, the researchers argue that they may both be combined. We\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at how they do that in a bit.\n Cognitive Flexibility Theory  Core syllogism\n Learning is the active construction of conceptual understanding. Training must support the learner in overcoming reductive explanation. Reductive explanation reinforces and preserves itself through misconception networks and through knowledge shields. Advanced learning is the ability to flexibly apply knowledge to cases within the domain.  Therefore, instruction by incremental complexification will not be conducive of advanced learning.\nTherefore, advanced learning is promoted by emphasizing the interconnectedness of multiple cases and concepts along multiple dimensions, and the use of multiple, highly organized representations.\nEmpirical ground\n Studies of learning of topics that have conceptual complexity (medical students). Demonstrations of knowledge shields and dimensions of difficulty. Demonstrations that learners tend to oversimplify (reductive bias) by the spurious reduction of complexity. Studies of the value of using multiple analogies. Demonstrations that learners tend to regularise that which is irregular, which leads to failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Demonstrations that learners tend to de-contextualize concepts, which leads to failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Demonstrations that learners tend to take the role of passive recipient versus active participants. Hypothesis that learners tend to rely too much on generic abstractions, which can be too far removed from the specific instances experienced to be apparently applicable to new cases, i.e., failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Conceptual complexity and case-to-case irregularity pose problems for traditional theories and modes of instruction. Instruction that simplifies and then complicates incrementally can detract from advanced knowledge acquisition by facilitating the formation of reductive understanding and knowledge shields. Instruction that emphasizes recall memory will not contribute to inferential understanding and advanced knowledge acquisition (transfer).  Additional propositions in the theory\n Advanced knowledge acquisition (apprentice-journeyman-expert) depends on the ability to achieve deeper understanding and apply it flexibly. Barriers to advanced learning include complexity, interactions, context-dependence, and illstructuredness (inconsistent patterns of concepts-in-combination). Cognitive flexibility includes the ability to mobilize small, pre-compiled knowledge structures, and this \u0026ldquo;adaptive schema assembly\u0026rdquo; involves integration and updating, rather than just recall. Active \u0026ldquo;assembly of knowledge\u0026rdquo; from different conceptual and case sources is more important in learning (for domains of complexity and ill-structuredness) than retrieval of knowledge structures. Misconceptions compound into networks of misconceptions. Misconceptions of fundamental concepts can cohere in systematic ways, making each misconception easier to believe and harder to change. Representations with high interconnectedness will tend to serve as \u0026ldquo;misconception-disabling correct knowledge.\u0026rdquo; Cognitive flexibility is the ability to represent knowledge from different conceptual and case perspectives and construct from those an adaptive knowledge ensemble tailored to the needs of the problem at hand.   [formatting mine]\n Cognitive Transformation Theory  Core syllogism\n Learning consists of the elaboration and replacement of mental models. Mental models are limited and include knowledge shields. Knowledge shields lead to wrong diagnoses and enable the discounting of evidence.  Therefore learning must also involve unlearning.\nEmpirical ground and claims\n Studies of the reasoning of scientists Flawed \u0026ldquo;storehouse\u0026rdquo; memory metaphor and the teaching philosophy it entailed (memorization of facts; practice plus immediate feedback, outcome feedback). Studies of science learning showing how misconceptions lead to error. Studies of scientist and student reactions to anomalous data. Success of \u0026ldquo;cognitive conflict\u0026rdquo; methods at producing conceptual change.  Additional propositions in the theory\n Mental models are reductive and fragmented, and therefore incomplete and flawed. Learning is the refinement of mental models. Mental models provide causal explanations. Experts have more detailed and more sophisticated mental models than novices. Experts have more accurate causal mental models. Flawed mental models are barriers to learning (knowledge shields). Learning is by sensemaking (discovery, reflection) as well as by teaching. Refinement of mental models entails at least some un-learning (accommodation; restructuring, changes to core concepts). Refinement of mental models can take the form of increased sophistication of a flawed model, making it easier for the learner to explain away inconsistencies or anomalous data. Learning is discontinuous. (Learning advances when flawed mental models are replaced, and is stable when a model is refined and gets harder to disconfirm.) People have a variety of fragmented mental models. \u0026ldquo;Central\u0026rdquo; mental models are causal stories.   The emphasis of CFT is on overcoming simplifying mental models. Hence it advises against applying instructional methods that involve progressive complexity. CTT, on the other hand, focuses on strategies, and the learning and unlearning of strategies. The two theories focus on marginally different things:\nCFT and CTT each try to achieve increases in proficiency, but in different ways. For CFT, it is flexibility and for CTT, it is a better mental model, but one that will have to be thrown out later on. CFT does not say what the sweet spot is for flexibility. A learner who over complexifies may not get any traction and might become paralysed. It thus might be considered a \u0026ldquo;lopsided\u0026rdquo; theory, or at least an incomplete one. CFT emphasises the achievement of flexibility whereas CTT emphasises the need for unlearning and relearning. Both theories regard advanced learning as a form of sensemaking (discovery, reflection) and both regard learning as discontinuous; advancing when flawed mental models are replaced, stable when a model is refined and gets harder to disconfirm.\n I recommend reading through the two theories carefully, reflecting on their implications, and perhaps investigating their origins (the paper for CFT is here (a); the paper for CTT found here (a)). The implications of both theories are quite profound, and are expressed in the training approach presented at the heart of Accelerated Expertise. But they may also be found in many of the training approaches found in the NDM world (a).\nBy the middle of Part 2 of the book, the two theories are combined into one core theory, like so:\nThe core syllogism of the CFT-CTT merger\n Learning is the active construction of knowledge; the elaboration and replacement of mental models, causal stories, or conceptual understandings. All mental models are limited. People have a variety of fragmentary and often reductive mental models. Training must support the learner in overcoming reductive explanations. Knowledge shields lead to wrong diagnoses and enable the discounting of evidence. Reductive explanation reinforces and preserves itself through misconception networks and through knowledge shields. Flexible learning involves the interplay of concepts and contextual particulars as they play out within and are influenced by cases of application within a domain.  Therefore learning must also involve unlearning and relearning.\nTherefore advanced learning is promoted by emphasising the interconnectedness of multiple cases and concepts along multiple conceptual dimensions, and the use of multiple, highly organised representations.\n Other implications of this theory likely exist. I\u0026rsquo;m still working them out for myself, and I urge you to do the same.\n[formatting mine]\n Wrapping up  Over the course of seven chapters, the authors take great pain to repeat two lessons again and again:\n That, first, everything in the expertise literature is difficult to generalise. Some methods work well in some domains but not in others. The ultimate test is in the application: if you attempt to put something to practice, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that the technique is bad. It just means that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for your particular context. The sooner you learn to embrace this, the better. Second, the authors take care to point out that a great many things about training can probably never be known. For instance, it is nearly impossible to isolate the factors that result in successful training in real world contexts — and yet real world contexts is ultimately where we want training to occur. There are simply too many confounding variables. And the truth is that we can\u0026rsquo;t go the other way and run perfectly controlled experiments either — there is a great deal of difficulty getting lab-based or classroom-based training to work. Certainly, the military (and industry!) is interested in what works on the battlefield and in the corporation; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care about what is publishable or testable in controlled classroom environments.  The overall picture that I got from the book goes something like this: \u0026ldquo;We know very little about expertise. There are large gaps in our empirical base. (Please, DoD, fund us so we can plug them!) What we do know is messy, because there are a ton of confounding variables. And yet, given that we\u0026rsquo;ve mostly worked in applied domains, our training programs seem to deliver results for businesses and soldiers, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t perfectly understand how they do so. Perhaps this is simply the nature of things in expertise research. We have discovered several things that work — the biggest of which is Cognitive Task Analysis, which enable us to extract actual mental models of expertise. We also have a usable macrocognitive theory of learning. But beyond that — phooey. Perhaps we just have to keep trying things, and check that our learners get better faster, and we can only speculate at why our programs work; we can never know for sure.\u0026rdquo;\n Flashcards See (Hoffman 2013).\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}chin. 2021. “An Easier Method for Extracting Tacit Knowledge.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/an-easier-method-for-extracting-tacit-knowledge/.

Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.\nLet me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:\n\u0026ldquo;Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,\u0026rdquo; said a meek voce outside the door.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,\u0026rdquo; the Professor said to the children, \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?\u0026rdquo; The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a-doubling so many years, you see,\u0026rdquo; the tailor replied, a little grufy, \u0026ldquo;and I think I\u0026rsquo;d like the money now. It\u0026rsquo;s two thousand pound, it is!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s nothing!\u0026rdquo; the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. \u0026ldquo;But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you\u0026rsquo;d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know as I\u0026rsquo;d care about being a king,\u0026rdquo; the man said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;But it dew sound a powerful sight o' money! Well, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll wait-\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course you will!\u0026rdquo; said the Professor. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?\u0026rdquo; Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.\n\u0026ldquo;Never, my child!\u0026rdquo; the Professor replied emphatically. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it\u0026rsquo;s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!\u0026rdquo;\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Keynes, John Maynard. 2010.

The \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; evolved as a competition training plan designed for continuous improvement, and as something easy to pick up, follow, and understand. The original \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; is an intense training plan based around 6 sessions per week, designed for regular competition and testing. However, it is followed in such a way that you always use previous training sessions to set targets for future sessions, enabling continuous improvement, and allowing even a complete beginner to follow the plan. Jumping straight in to the full volume of 6 sessions a week would be tough for a beginner though, and so the following 24 weeks plan gradually increases the volume, and will introduce you to some of the key training principles for the indoor rower.\n The 24 week \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo;  The 24 week training plan set out here is aimed at the beginner to intermediate indoor rower. The training plan is set out in a simple to follow format, with each week containing 3 core sessions, and for the keen trainer, 2 additional optional sessions. See the next section where this training plan is reproduced along with explanations for how to complete each session, and the key aims behind them. As such each week is set out with the 5 workouts, the core workouts first (completed on separate days), followed by the two optional workouts in [square brackets]. The idea here is that you complete the core workouts every week, and when you have the time and motivation you might pick one of the optional workouts on occasional weeks.\nNote: Below this summary of the sessions you will find a full explanation of how to follow each session in the plan, so do scroll down and use those notes as you follow through the sessions. If anything isn\u0026rsquo;t clear to you, please do email me at thepeteplan@gmail.com to ask.\nNote: If even this volume of sessions looks too much, simply halve each session for your first time through the plan and begin with a 2500m row on Day 1, 3 x 500m on Day 2 and so on.\n   Week Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 (optional) Day 5 (optional)     1 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest 5000m 20min 2 x 10min / 2min rest   2 5500m 4 x 750m / 2min rest 5500m 20min 3 x 8min / 2min rest   3 6000m 2 x 2000m / 4min rest 6000m 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest   4 6500m 3 x 1000m / 3min rest 6500m 6000m 2 x 2500m / 2min rest   5 7000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest 7000m 20min 2 x 10min / 2min rest   6 7500m 3 x 2000m / 4min rest 7500m 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest   7 8000m 7 x 500m / 2min rest 8000m 6000m 3 x 1500m / 3min rest   8 8500m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 8000m 25min 3 x 1k / 3min rest   9 9000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest 8000m 8000m 2 x 10min / 2min rest   10 9500m 3 x 2000m / 4min rest 8000m 8000m 7 x 500m / 2min rest   11 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 8000m 25mins 4 x 1500m / 3min rest   12 10000m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 8000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest   13 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 8000m 3 x 2k / 4min rest   14 10000m 3 x 2k / 4min rest 4 x 8min / 2min rest 30min 7 x 500m / 2min rest   15 10000m 5 x 750m / 2min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 8000m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest   16 10500m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest   17 10500m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 30min 4 x 8min / 2min rest   18 11000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest 30min 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest   19 10000m 5 x 800m / 2min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 30min 4 x 2k / 4min rest   20 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest   21 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 4 x 8min / 2min rest 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest   22 12000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest 30min 3 x 10min / 2min rest] 5 x 800m / 2min rest   23 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 10000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest   24 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 2 x 15min / 2min rest] 4 x 1k / 3min rest    [formatting mine]\n The 24 week \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; explained Week 1    Day 1: 5000m\nThe three key points you want to concentrate on during all of your erg sessions are technique, relaxation, and efficiency. Use the single distance pieces to work on the different elements of the stroke you read about in the technique section. Aim for a feeling of smooth acceleration through the drive, and to be slow and relaxed during the recovery.\n  Day 2: 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nInterval sessions allow you to work at a higher intensity by splitting the workout into smaller segments. Don\u0026rsquo;t get carried away in the early intervals thinking it is easy though, you have many weeks ahead to increase the intensity. As you become more experienced at interval training over the coming weeks you will learn how to pace the different types of session.\n  Day 3: 5000m\nLook back at the average pace of your last 5000m session a few days ago. Aim to row at that pace consistently through this session, and don\u0026rsquo;t give in to any temptations to go faster, especially towards the start. Remember \u0026ldquo;technique, relaxation, efficiency\u0026rdquo;.\n  Day 4 (optional): 20min\nFirst week and you\u0026rsquo;re already thinking about doing extra sessions? Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not over-doing it early on, rest is a very important part of any training plan. Whether your 5000m sessions have been taking you more or less than 20mins, aim to row this session at a slower pace, concentrating on making each stroke more efficient than the last.\n  Day 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\n5 sessions in the first week, you must be keen. Have a go at your first longer interval session. Breaking up the 20min row like this allows you a short break to regain your full concentration, and make sure to take on some water while you can. Row the first 10min at the same pace as your 20min session, and then aim to just beat the distance on the second 10min.\n   Week 2    Day 1: 5500m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see a pattern develop over the first few weeks of your new training plan. These single distance sessions will increase by 500m each week, building the duration gradually up. As your fitness will be increasing each week, and your technique improving, you should find that despite the increase is distance, the pace can be kept the same as the 5000m rows from last week.\n  Day 2: 4 x 750m / 2min rest\nThe intervals are 50% longer this week, but the total distance of the session is the same. Look back at your average pace from the 6 x 500m session last week, and try to row each interval at exactly that pace. Don\u0026rsquo;t go faster, no matter how tempted you feel!\n  Day 3: 5500m\nSame story as last week, aim for the same pace as the 5500m row a few days ago, but aim to row it as consistently as possible, keeping the pace the same on every stroke.\n  Day 4 (optional): 20min\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very likely now that 20min is less than it took you to row the 5500m this week, so aim to row this at the same pace as the 5500m rows this week.\n  Day 5 (optional): 3 x 8min / 2min rest\nIf you did the 5th session last week, aim for the same pace, if not, a similar pace to the 20min session will be about right.\n   Week 3    Day 1: 6000m\nThe distance is still increasing by 500m each week, but your fitness and technique will be progressing rapidly too, so I bet you want to row further than this? Well keep building up gradually, and keep logging your sessions in the training diary, and you can look back in a few weeks time at the progress you\u0026rsquo;ve made. Again, same pace as the 5500m last week, if you can.\n  Day 2: 2 x 2000m / 4min rest\nThis will be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve tried longer intervals with a reasonably long rest time. Not too dissimilar to the 5th sessions of weeks 1 and 2 if you attempted those, but the longer rest and slightly lower distance mean you can push the pace a little more. Still focus on technique and efficiency, but try to go about 2seconds faster pace than the 6000m session of a day or two ago.\n  Day 3: 6000m\nAgain, aim for the same pace as your first 6000m session a few days ago. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if these sessions feel harder some days and you don\u0026rsquo;t make your target. Many things can affect your performance from fatigue from previous sessions, to environmental conditions such as temperature, to hydration and nutrition. Any day you don\u0026rsquo;t perform so well, try to pinpoint anything you might have done differently, and note it down.\n  Day 4 (optional): 5000m\nAim for the same pace as you did for your 6000m in the last session, and try to speed up a little then within the last 1000m.\n  Day 5 (optional): 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back in your training diary to week 1 when you last did this session. Start out 1second faster pace and see how you get on.\n   Week 4    Day 1: 6500m\nYou should be getting the idea with these session now, 500m more each week, aiming for the same pace. These two sessions are the core of your training at the moment, and in a few weeks time you\u0026rsquo;ll realise just how much improvement you\u0026rsquo;ve made.\n  Day 2: 3 x 1000m / 3min rest\nA new interval session now, working around the same intensity as the 6 x 500m session you did in week 1 (and perhaps as an optional session last week). Try for the same pace you did for that session in week 1.\n  Day 3: 6500m\nAs day one of this week.\n  Day 4 (optional): 6000m\nYou might be starting to develop some judgement by now of how to pace the sessions as the distance changes slightly. Aim just to go for the same pace as your 6500m sessions this week for this one.\n  Day 5 (optional): 2 x 2500m / 2min rest\nAnother different interval session to try, but very similar to session 5 in week 1 if you attempted that. When you\u0026rsquo;re looking at how to pace a session, always look back in your diary for the most recent similar session, and see what the differences are. For this session, aim to go 1 second faster pace than the 6000m in the last session.\n   Week 5    Day 1: 7000m\nYou know what to do on these now.\n  Day 2: 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been training for a month now, and your muscles are getting used to the workload you\u0026rsquo;re putting them under, so now it\u0026rsquo;s time to start challenging yourself a little more each week. Go for the same average pace you managed in the 3 x 1000m session last week, but when it comes to the last interval, see how fast you can do it, but maintaining good technique.\n  Day 3: 7000m\nAs always.\n  Day 4 (optional): 20min\nOn these supplementary sessions judge by how you feel, and how hard you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on the other sessions. If you\u0026rsquo;re pretty tired still from the last session, but want to train, just concentrate on technique, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace. At this stage all technique work is good. If you feel good, go for 1 to 2 seconds faster pace than you did for the 7000m rows this week.\n  Day 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\nJust aim for a similar pace to the last session.\n   Week 6    Day 1: 7500m\nWho would have thought 6 weeks ago that you\u0026rsquo;d be rowing 50% further on these sessions now, but still at the same pace? Use the great improvements you\u0026rsquo;ve made so far as motivation to add in one or two of the optional sessions this week if you\u0026rsquo;ve not tried them yet.\n  Day 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nBack in week 3 you did a 2 x 2000m session. Aim for the same pace, and see if you can manage to maintain it on that 3rd rep.\n  Day 3: 7500m\nYou know what to do.\n  Day 4 (optional): 5000m\nYou want to do more? Aim to start this one at the same pace as the 7500m sessions this week, but once you get past half way try speeding up the pace by 1 second every time you feel able to.\n  Day 5 (optional): 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nThese should feel quite short after those 800\u0026rsquo;s you did last week. Use your judgement for how fast to pace them, but beware going too fast on the early reps or you might meet Mr Lactic Acid, who you will become well acquainted with in the weeks to come.\n   Week 7    Day 1: 8000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been doing these sessions for 6 weeks now, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to start taking note of some other parameters as well as the pace. Look back in your training log to see the average stroke rate you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing for these sessions so far. If it\u0026rsquo;s 24 or under, that\u0026rsquo;s great, but if it\u0026rsquo;s over 24, try to focus during this session on making every drive count, and being relaxed and slower on the recoveries. Don\u0026rsquo;t go for a big jump in rate if you\u0026rsquo;ve been rowing above 24spm, but try just to lower it by 1 or 2 by slowing down the recovery.\n  Day 2: 7 x 500m / 2min rest\nOne more rep than you did for this session in week 1 (and possibly in the optional sessions in weeks 3 and 6). If you did the 6 x 500m session last week, aim for the same pace, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve not done this session since week 1, aim to be 1 to 2 seconds faster pace, but use your judgement as to whether this is too fast on the early reps.\n  Day 3: 8000m\nAgain, concentrate on bringing your stroke rate down to 24 or below now for these sessions.\n  Day 4 (optional): 6000m\nOn the optional sessions remember to judge how well recovered you are from the previous sessions in the week, and aim for a pace based on that. Perhaps aim for the same pace as the 8000m sessions this week, but at a lower stroke rate.\n  Day 5 (optional): 3 x 1500m / 3min rest\nLast week you did 2000m reps, so go for a pace 1sec faster than you managed for that last week. Remember to try to keep the pace consistent across each repetition.\n   Week 8    Day 1: 8500m\nTechnique, relaxation, and efficiency.\n  Day 2: 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nIf you did the optional session last week you\u0026rsquo;ll have a good idea how to pace this one. If not, aim for the same pace as you did the 2000m reps in week 6. See if you can go slightly faster on the 4th rep – although there are 4 reps this week, the total distance is still 6000m.\n  Day 3: 8000m\nYour second single distance session this week is slightly shorter than the first. Aim for the same pace over the first 6000m, then see if you can speed up a little over the final 2000m.\n  Day 4 (optional): 25min\nRowing to a set time, rather than distance, doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect how to pace a training row. Still aim for a stroke rate of 24 or just below, and a constant pace throughout, perhaps 1sec faster than the previous 8000m session.\n  Day 5 (optional): 3 x 1k / 3min rest\nSee if you can row this at the same pace as the 7 x 500m last week. Start to notice the stroke rate on these interval sessions too now, and how it compares to the (slower paced) single distance or time sessions.\n   Week 9    Day 1: 9000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been going for a full 2 months now, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably starting to look ahead and wonder when these sessions will stop getting longer! Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a break from the increasing distance soon, and then you can start increasing the pace instead!\n  Day 2: 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nWeek 5 was the last time you did this session, a full month ago. Look back in your training diary and the pace you did then will probably seem like an easy target now. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too ambitious yet though. If you really feel you\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way over the past 4 weeks, aim for 1sec faster pace, otherwise go for the same pace and use whatever energy you have left for the final rep. This session should be the one where you\u0026rsquo;re breathing the hardest each week, and where you\u0026rsquo;re always looking back for a target to beat.\n  Day 3: 8000m\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget your main aim is always to work on technique. Periodically have a look back in the technique section of this guide to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not picking up any bad habits.\n  Day 4 (optional): 8000m\nMore of the same.\n  Day 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\nAim to row the first piece just a second or so faster than the 8000m row, and then beat it on the second piece.\n   Week 10    Day 1: 9500m\nHave a look back through your training diary and see how the pace and rate of these single distance rows has been progressing. You should have been holding the pace the same week by week as the distance has increased, but your stroke rate has probably been dropping gradually too.\n  Day 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nLook back to week 6 when you last did this session, with a similar session in week 8. Go for a pace 1 second faster than you did in week 6, and faster still for the last rep if you can.\n  Day 3: 8000m\nWhile the second steady distance sessions are a little shorter than the first each week, aim to row the first 6000m at the same pace as the earlier row, and then gradually speed up to the end, known as \u0026ldquo;negative splitting\u0026rdquo;.\n  Day 4 (optional): 8000m\nAs the last session.\n  Day 5 (optional): 7 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 7 when you last tried this session. Aim to row the first 6 reps at the same average pace you managed last time, and then go faster for the final rep.\n   Week 11    Day 1: 10000m\nYou should feel very good about yourself after this one. Double the distance of your first session back in week 1.\n  Day 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nAn extra rep this week on your 500m intervals. This is a great session for working on your basic speed, and very good for preparing you to row the golden distance, 2000m. Aim for the same pace you managed back in week 7 on the first 7 reps, and then faster for the final rep.\n  Day 3: 8000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re up to a full program of work now, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re doing one or two of the optional sessions each week. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to row too hard on this session, use a rate restriction to limit yourself. Limit yourself to a maximum rate of 2 or 3 lower than you would normally for these sessions, and see how this affects the pace. (Hint – you will probably have to go a little slower!)\n  Day 4 (optional): 25mins\nTry to play little games to make the time pass quicker, and to keep working on your technique and efficiency. Count how many strokes in a row you can hold your target split, once you miss it start counting again, and try to beat your previous total.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nWeek 8 was the last time you did this session. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re doing the same session every few weeks, use the following method to know how to pace them. Take your average pace from the previous time you did the session, and row that pace for all but the last rep. On the final rep try to go a little faster, and note down your new best average pace for the session.\n   Week 12    Day 1: 10000m\nFor the first time in the training plan you aren\u0026rsquo;t increasing the distance on these sessions any more, what a relief! You\u0026rsquo;ll be sticking to this distance for another 3 weeks too. Each time aim to improve on the average pace slightly, even if only by a tenth of a second.\n  Day 2: 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nIf you did this as the optional session last week, go for the same pacing plan again. If you\u0026rsquo;ve not done it since week 8, see the description for how to pace it last week.\n  Day 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nOn all interval sessions, aim to either go at the same pace during all intervals, or gradually increase the pace through the reps. Try never to go at such a pace that makes you slow down by the end of the session. Do the first two reps at the same pace as your 10k this week, and see if you can go a little faster on the final one.\n  Day 4 (optional): 8000m\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;re up to a full volume training plan, and beginning to increase the intensity, you need to take some sessions a little easier. For the optional single distance sessions try to keep the stroke rate right down, between 20 and 22spm, to limit your pace on them.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 9 in your training diary, and remember the principles for how to pace these sessions now. Go at the average pace for that session for the first 3 reps, and then try to go a little faster on the final one.\n   Week 13    Day 1: 10000m\nAgain, try to improve on your average pace from the 10000m row last week. To ensure you are never in danger of not completing a session, set out at the same pace you achieved last time for the first three quarters or so of the row, and only then begin to speed up gradually.\n  Day 2: 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nSlightly longer reps that the session in week 9 (or the optional session last week), but also the rest time is increased by a minute. Try to go for the same pace you managed in week 9, and your increased fitness should see you do a fast last rep!\n  Day 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nGo for the same pace you achieved on the 3 x 10min last week, and remember to try to make the second rep slightly faster than the first.\n  Day 4 (optional): 8000m\nKeep the stroke rate low, and concentrate on technique.\n  Day 5 (optional): 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAim for the same pace as the 4 x 1500m last week.\n   Week 14    Day 1: 10000m\nKeep those improvements coming, the faster you row, the quicker you finish!\n  Day 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAim for the same pace as the 4 x 1500m in week 12.\n  Day 3: 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nGo for the same pace on the first 3 reps as the 2 x 15min last week, and see if you can build the pace during the last rep to finish fast.\n  Day 4 (optional): 30min\nWith a low rate, and concentrating on technique, have a look back in your training diary a few weeks and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably find you\u0026rsquo;re going faster than you were doing this sort of duration at then, at a lower stroke rate, and without trying too hard!\n  Day 5 (optional): 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nIn week 11 you completed this session. Do the first 7 intervals at the same pace you averaged for that session, and aim to go faster on the last rep.\n   Week 15    Day 1: 10000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re probably getting into this indoor rowing lark by now, impressing your mates with split times and stroke rates. You must really want a new 10000m personal best to tell them about tomorrow. Aim for the stroke rate of 24spm, and go for the same split time as last week for the first 8000m, and then speed up over the last 2000m just for those bragging rights!\n  Day 2: 5 x 750m / 2min rest\nThis is similar to the 4 x 1000m session from week 13. Aim for the same pace as you achieved then over the first 4 reps, and then try to go faster for the final rep.\n  Day 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nVery similar to the 4 x 8min last week. Aim for the same pace you achieved then for the first 2 reps, and then faster on the final rep.\n  Day 4 (optional): 8000m\nYou went quite hard on the 10000m session this week to show off to your mates, so take it easier on this one. Restrict the stroke rate as you have done before to a maximum of 22spm, focus on technique, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about the pace.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be doing 5 reps of this session next week, so use this as a good indicator of how fast you can pace that. Go for the same pace as you managed for the 3 x 2000m last week, but resist the temptation to do a faster last rep, unless it feels really easy!\n   Week 16    Day 1: 10500m\nOh no, an increase in distance again! 10000m is a great longer distance training session for indoor rowers, but going \u0026ldquo;over distance\u0026rdquo; sometimes and rowing a bit further brings the 10000m further inside your capability range.\n  Day 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nDid you have a taster of this session last week on the optional session? If not, look back to week 13 and the 3 x 2000m session. Aim for the same pace as you achieved then.\n  Day 3: 30min\nAim for the same pace you achieved on the 10000m row in week 15. 30mins is less time than it took you to cover 10000m, so you should have some energy left to speed up in the final minutes.\n  Day 4 (optional): 10000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re putting in a lot of distance each week now, so it is becoming even more essential to know when to take it easy. Restrict the rate again to a maximum of 22spm, and concentrate on technique, and an efficient delivery of power during the drive.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nYou need to know when to take it easy, but you also don\u0026rsquo;t want to go slower than you\u0026rsquo;ve gone on a session before! You haven\u0026rsquo;t done this session since week 13, so look back in your diary at the pace you achieved then, and stick to that for the first 3 reps, with a faster final rep.\n   Week 17    Day 1: 10500m\nConsolidate your distance work by going for the same split time you managed last week for this session.\n  Day 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook right back to week 11 for the last time you did this session. I bet that pace look easy now, 6 weeks on, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Small improvements are the way to go, however, so aim for the same average pace as last time for the first 7 reps, and then give everything you have for a fast final rep!\n  Day 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nAim for the same pace you managed for the 3 x 10min in week 15.\n  Day 4 (optional): 30min\nUse the rate restriction and again work on technique. Keeping at a maximum of 22spm, think about the correct sequence of actions during the recovery, and maintaining relaxation.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nLook back to week 14 for a reference pace from your training diary, you know what to do.\n   Week 18    Day 1: 11000m\nAs before, aim for the same pace as you did for the 10500m session last week.\n  Day 2: 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nIn week 14 you did this session with 3 reps. Do the first 3 reps at the pace you managed for that session, and the month of work you\u0026rsquo;ve done since will allow you the extra rep.\n  Day 3: 30min\nRow the same pace you did for the 11000m for the first 20mins, and then speed up every couple of minutes through to the end.\n  Day 4 (optional): 10000m\nTry restricting the stroke rate to a strict 20spm for the first half of this row, working on technique. From half way allow yourself to increase the rate only with a corresponding increase in pace.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nYou last did this session in week 16, or week 13. Aim for the same average pace you managed on your last attempt for the first 3 reps, and then all out for the final rep.\n   Week 19    Day 1: 10000m\nFor the past 3 weeks you have rowed over 10000m for your first session of the week. Look back in your diary to week 15 when you last did this, and see if you can beat that personal best time. If you ever have a session where you feel you can\u0026rsquo;t maintain the pace, just back off slightly and slow down, but try never to fail to complete the session.\n  Day 2: 5 x 800m / 2min rest\nBack in week 15 you did 5 x 750m. This session only has another 6 or 7 strokes per rep, and 6 or 7 strokes is nothing really, is it? Just row the first 4 reps at the same pace you managed in that session, and show yourself how much mental toughness you\u0026rsquo;ve built up over the last 19weeks by how fast you can do that last rep.\n  Day 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nYou should have got the hang of these sessions by now. They are effectively the same as the single time or distance pieces, with the short rest breaks allowing for you to take on some water, stretch your legs for a few seconds, and refocus. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever training on a very hot day, you can split up any long distance piece with short rests like this, just try to make sure the rest is never longer than a quarter of the previous piece.\n  Day 4 (optional): 30min\nRestrict the stroke rate to 22 or lower, and concentrate solely on technique, not worrying about the split time at all.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nYou only did this session last week, so aim for the same pace if you feel up to it. If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel physically or mentally up for equaling a recent time for one of the interval sessions just restrict the stroke rate, and aim for a slower target pace. Just make sure to note in your training diary exactly what you did so you know when reading back.\n   Week 20    Day 1: 12000m\nThis is the further you\u0026rsquo;ll have rowed in a session before. Ease into the row nice and slowly, perhaps 5 seconds slower in pace than you did the 10000m row last week. Just slowly increase the pace over the first half, and aim to be hitting that 10000m pace by about 5000m to go. If you can, keep \u0026ldquo;negative splitting\u0026rdquo; for the remainder of the distance.\n  Day 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou did this session last in week 16, but since then you have done 4 x 2000m once or twice. Compare the paces from the two different sessions, and you should be fairly similar in pace between the two sessions. Use the fastest pace of the two as your target for the first 4 reps, and as always, aim to go faster on the last rep if you can.\n  Day 3: 30min\nYou started off slowly on the 12000m row this week, so try to make this one steady all the way. Aim for the best pace you\u0026rsquo;ve held yet over 10000m, and try the game of counting how many strokes in a row you can hold the same split time for. Do you remember how many you managed last time? Can you beat it?\n  Day 4 (optional): 10000m\nRestrict the rate, work on technique, relaxation and efficiency, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace.\n  Day 5 (optional): 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 17 when you last did this session. Can you beat the average pace you managed that time? This session will be a good indicator of the pace you could try a single 2000m row at, after you\u0026rsquo;ve completed the full 24 weeks of this training plan.\n   Week 21    Day 1: 10000m\nBegin this row at a pace 2 seconds slower than your best 10000m previously. Gradually increase the pace up to half way, aiming to be at your pb pace by this stage. Hold this pace for another 2000m, and then see if you can gradually increase the pace for the final 3000m – how close can you get to your pb pace in the end?\n  Day 2: 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nLook back to find the last time you did this session, and also the last time you did 8 x 500m, and see how the paces compare between them. 8 x 500m will be faster, but by how much? You have probably realised that the sessions all fit into a few groups of similar workouts, and it is useful to see the relationships between the paces of sessions in these groups, so you can compare to more recent sessions, not necessarily to exactly the same session.\n  Day 3: 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nStart thinking of these sessions as a steady distance piece with short rests to re-hydrate and refocus, rather than an interval session. Aim for a similar pace to that you would for a 30min single piece.\n  Day 4 (optional): 12000m\nAim for a steady stroke rate of 20spm, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace. Switch the display to read calories or watts if you want to so that your focus isn\u0026rsquo;t on how fast you\u0026rsquo;re going. Just concentrate on easy efficiency.\n  Day 5 (optional): 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou only completed this session last week, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect big improvements like you\u0026rsquo;d get if it was 3 weeks ago you last did it. Aim for the same pace you managed last week.\n   Week 22    Day 1: 12000m\nAim for a steady pace a couple of seconds slower than you managed on the 10000m row last week. When you do these longer rows, look back through the memory on the machine afterwards to see if you rowed it at as consistent a pace as you thought you did.\n  Day 2: 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAs discussed in week 20, this session and the 5 x 1500m session are very closely related. You should be able to get a good idea how the pace of the two sessions compare to each other now, but if in doubt, always aim for the same average pace you last managed on the exact session, for all but the last rep. On the last rep of these sessions always try to go slightly faster than the previous reps.\n  Day 3: 30min\nTry a strict rate restriction of 20spm for this row. The 30min at 20spm, or 30r20, session is a popular one with rowers and ergers alike, and it\u0026rsquo;s another good one to compare your performance with others, and baffle your mates with why it makes a different what your spm was.\n  Day 4 (optional): 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nYou know now to treat these sessions like any other distance piece. Put a rate restriction on and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about pace if you feel you need an easier session, or aim for a solid 30min pace, close to your best, if you feel good.\n  Day 5 (optional): 5 x 800m / 2min rest\nThis session fits in the same group as the other 1000m and less reps sessions, working on your higher end pace. Look back to week 19 for the last time you did this session, and dig deep for the desire to destroy the pace you did then. For the first 4 reps, hold back that desire by going at the same pace, then unleash it all on the final rep and show the erg who\u0026rsquo;s boss!\n   Week 23    Day 1: 10000m\nHow did you row your best 10000m time so far? Was it by rowing at a steady pace all the way, or negative splitting and getting gradually faster as you did 2 weeks ago? Whichever method you found best for you, try that again with this session and see if you can set a new 10000m pb.\n  Day 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back in your training diary for your last completed go at this session, and find the target pace as you have before.\n  Day 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nDo you feel good? If so, row the first 15min slightly slower than your best ever 30min row, then try to beat yourself on the second 15min!\n  Day 4 (optional): 10000m\nTake it easy, especially if you plan on doing the 5th session this week. Restrict the rate to 22 or less, with a corresponding pace target.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nYou only did this session last week, can you match it, or better still, beat it by doing the final rep faster?\n   Week 24    Day 1: 12000m\nKeeping the rate at 24 or less, always work on technique during these longer pieces. Don\u0026rsquo;t work too hard to make sure you recover well for the interval sessions.\n  Day 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nLook back to week 20. You\u0026rsquo;re into the final week of the training plan now, so you want to finish on a high with a pb on one of the key sessions in your training plan. Finish the first 4 reps with the minimum effort possible to hit your target, and then prove how tough you are by beating the target on the final rep.\n  Day 3: 30min\nYou should be experienced at using your judgement now, so pace this according to how you are feeling from the training volume so far this week.\n  Day 4 (optional): 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nRemember to treat this as though a single distance session, and aim for the second piece to be slightly faster than the first.\n  Day 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nWeek 21 was the last time you completed this session. Your final session of the 24 week plan, so think about the improvements you\u0026rsquo;ve made during the past 6 months, and think back to those first few sessions in week 1.\n   Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Marston, Pete. 2008. “Beginner Training.” Lunch Hour. https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/beginner-training/.

Outside of running long distances on a flat surface and power-lifting, practically all sports require some combi- nation of endurance and strength. Endurance and strength can be developed simultaneously to some degree. How- ever, the development of a high level of endurance seems to prohibit the development or maintenance of muscle mass and strength. This interaction between endurance and strength is called the concurrent training effect. This review specifically defines the concurrent training effect, discusses the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, and proposes strategies to maximize strength and endurance in the high-level athlete.\n Introduction  Plot showing strength training beats out concurrent training over time\nThe concurrent training effect on strength. The figure shows the increase in one repetition maximum in the squat in subjects who participated in 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance exercise alone (resistance), endurance exercise alone (endurance), and both types of training (concurrent). Also, note that the strength and concurrent groups both increased their strength together up to 7 weeks, when the strength group started making greater gains than the concurrent group (adapted from Hickson [1], with permission). 1RM one repetition maximum\n Molecular underpinning of muscle hypertrophy  Increased strength is the combined effect of improvements in neural activation, muscle fiber size, and connective tissue stiffness. Therefore, concomitant endurance exercise could decrease adaptations of any/all of these physiological parameters. There does not appear to be a decrease in the neural (learning) adaptation [\u0026hellip;] no one has measured the effect of concurrent training on connective tissue stiffness, so we are unsure of the role of this tissue in the impaired strength response. [\u0026hellip;] the primary effect of endurance exercise seems to be a decrease in resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.\n Science-based recommendations for training to maximize concurrent training  Using the molecular information provided in Sects. 2–5, some simple nutritional and training strategies can be devised to maximize the adaptations to concurrent training. The goal of these recommendations is to maximize the mitochondrial adaptation to endurance exercise and the muscle mass and strength adaptation to strength training. To do this, the following could be recommended:\n Any high-intensity endurance training sessions should be performed early in the day. Then, a period of recovery of at least 3 [hours] should be given, so that AMPK and SIRT1 activity can return to baseline levels, before resistance exercise is performed. This suggestion is based on the fact that AMPK activity increases rapidly and then returns to baseline levels within the first 3 [hours] after high-intensity exercise [63], whereas mTORC1 activity can be maintained for at least 18 h after resistance exercise [8, 9]. Resistance exercise should be supported by readily digestible, leucine-rich protein as soon as possible after training to maximize leucine uptake [64], mTOR recruitment to the lysosome [29], and protein synthesis [25]. Since, in this scenario, resistance exercise is performed later in the day, it becomes even more important to also consume protein immediately prior to sleep to maximize the synthetic response overnight [65]. Fully refuel between the morning high-intensity endurance training session and the afternoon strength session since AMPK can be activated by low glycogen [66], and SIRT1 is activated by caloric restriction [38]. If it is not possible to refuel completely because of the training volume and intensity, it might be best to reserve a portion of the offseason (and short periods in season) exclusively for increasing muscle size and strength and then use higher dietary protein intakes to maintain that muscle mass as the aerobic load increases through the season [67]. To improve the endurance response to lower-intensity endurance training sessions and provide a strong strength stimulus, consider performing strength training immediately after low-intensity, non-depleting, endurance sessions. Performing a strength session immediately after a low-intensity endurance session results in a greater stimulus for endurance adaptation than the low-intensity endurance session alone [68] and the low-intensity session will not affect signaling pathways regulating strength gains [51–53].

Recently developed to deal with road networks, it routinely finds solutions with half as many boundary edges (or fewer), compared to the general-purpose partitioners (such as METIS [20]) commonly used by previous algorithms.\n(Delling, Goldberg, Pajor, et al. 2011)\n An example, with \\(U=3\\):\n  Metric customization  The metric customization stage builds a graph \\(H\\) containing all boundary vertices (those with at least one neighbor in another cell) and boundary arcs of \\(G\\). It also contains a clique for each cell \\(C\\): for every pair \\((v, w)\\) of boundary vertices in \\(C\\), we create an arc \\((v, w)\\) whose cost is the same as the shortest path (restricted to \\(C\\)) between \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) (or infinite if \\(w\\) is not reachable from \\(v\\)). We do so by running Dijkstra [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm] from each boundary vertex. Note that \\(H\\) is an overlay [24]: the distance between any two vertices in \\(H\\) is the same as in \\(G\\).\n(Delling, Goldberg, Pajor, et al. 2011)\n Nodes in \\(H\\) are bold and clique edges are red.\n  Sparsification  Using full cliques in the overlay graph may seem wasteful, particularly for well-behaved metrics. At the cost of making its topology metric-dependent, we consider various techniques to reduce the overlay graph.\nThe first approach is edge reduction [24], which eliminates clique arcs that are not shortest paths. After computing all cliques, we run Dijkstra from each vertex \\(v\\) in \\(H\\), stopping as soon as all neighbors of \\(v\\) (in \\(H\\)) are scanned. Note that these searches are usually quick, since they only visit the overlay.\n(Delling, Goldberg, Pajor, et al. 2011)\n Query  [\u0026hellip;] to perform a query between \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), we run a bidirectional version of Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm] on the graph consisting of the union of \\(H\\), \\(C_s\\) , and \\(C_t\\) . (Here \\(C_v\\) denotes the subgraph of \\(G\\) induced by the vertices in the cell containing \\(v\\).)\n(Delling, Goldberg, Pajor, et al. 2011)\n Reduce query latency    Nested partitions\n To accelerate queries, we can use multiple levels of overlay graphs, a common technique for partition-based approaches, including HiTi (Jung and Pramanik 2002). We need nested partitions of \\(G\\), in which every boundary edge at level \\(i\\) is also a boundary edge at level \\(i − 1\\), for \\(i \u0026gt; 1\\). The level-0 partition is the original graph, with each vertex as a cell. For the \\(i\\text{-th}\\) level partition, we create a graph \\(H_i\\) as before: it includes all boundary arcs, plus an overlay linking the boundary vertices within a cell. Note that \\(H_i\\) can be computed using only \\(H_{i−1}\\). We use PUNCH [ (Delling, Goldberg, Razenshteyn, et al. 2011) ] to create multilevel partitions, in top-down fashion. An \\(s \\arrow t\\) query runs bidirectional Dijkstra on a restricted graph \\(G_{st}\\).

We present an algorithm to compute shortest paths on continental road networks with arbitrary metrics (cost functions). The approach supports turn costs, enables real-time queries, and can incorporate a new metric in a few seconds—fast enough to support real-time traffic updates and personalized optimization functions. The amount of metric-specific data is a small fraction of the graph itself, which allows us to maintain several metrics in memory simultaneously.\n Introduction  Most previous research focused on the most natural metric, driving times. Real-world systems, however, often support other natural metrics as well, such as shortest distance, walking, biking, avoid U-turns, avoid/prefer freeways, or avoid left turns.\n  Topology (Road networks) Metric (Customizable route planning)   The first [stage], metric-independent preprocessing, may be relatively slow, since it is run infrequently. It takes only the graph topology as input, and may produce a fair amount of auxiliary data (comparable to the input size). The second stage, metric customization, is run once for each metric, and must be much quicker (a few seconds) and produce little data—a small fraction of the original graph. Finally, the query stage uses the outputs of the first two stages and must be fast enough for real-time applications.\n Previous techniques Our approach Basic algorithm See Customizable route planning for write-up.\nSparsification See Customizable route planning for write-up.\nTurns Conclusion Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Delling, Daniel, Andrew V.

You should not be able to think of your next meal (nuggets!) while undertaking it. Purposeful practice should take you out of your comfort zone. It should feel painful to do. As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, playing a piece of music you already know how to play — for instance, during a musical performance — does not count, and writing a program that utilises techniques you already know to use also does not count for the purpose of mastery. Practice that makes you better should take maximal effort, and thus feel terribly unpleasant to do. Purposeful practice requires feedback, and adjustments to technique after getting the feedback. In its most general form, Ericsson notes that feedback need not be immediate — but it is most effective if the feedback loop is short. Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals.

You should not be able to think of your next meal (nuggets!) while undertaking it. Purposeful practice should take you out of your comfort zone. It should feel painful to do. As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, playing a piece of music you already know how to play — for instance, during a musical performance — does not count, and writing a program that utilises techniques you already know to use also does not count for the purpose of mastery.","title":"Purposeful practice"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Deliberate practice is Purposeful practice that knows where it is going and how to get there\u0026rdquo;.\n Deliberate practice, on the other hand, adds a small number of principles to [Purposeful practice]:\n First, it demands that the practice be conducted in a field with well-established training techniques. Fields like music, math and chess have rigorous training methods that have been developed over the course of decades. This makes such fields ideal candidates for deliberate practice. Second, it demands that practice be guided in the initial stages by a teacher or coach. This is somewhat linked to the first principle — that the practice occurs in a domain with established training methods mean that a teacher may use known pedagogical techniques to improve student performance. As the student improves, her ability to form accurate mental models will also improve; these models allow her to eventually practice on her own. Third, and last, deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically. This in turns implies finding teachers or coaches with ever higher levels of expertise, and learning better refinements from them.  (Chin 2019)\n   Principles of Deliberate Practice:\n The field must be well developed, the best performers must be clearly far superior to people just entering the field. If there\u0026rsquo;s no competition to indicate skill, then it\u0026rsquo;s hard for there to be deliberate practice because the differences of the best are less clear. Deliberate practice requires a teacher who can provide practice activities designed to help a student improve his or her performance. Near maximal effort, constantly being taken out of your comfort zone by a teacher or coach. Not \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; Well defined, specific goals, not aimed at \u0026ldquo;overall improvement.\u0026rdquo; Full attention and conscious action, no autopilot. Feedback and constant little improvements, modifying efforts in response to feedback Building and modifying mental representations Focusing on building and improving specific skills by focusing on aspects of those skills and improving them  (Eliason n.d.)\n   Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, a professor of Psychology at Florida State University, was a pioneer in researching deliberate practice and what it means. According to Ericsson:\nPeople believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults. [\u0026hellip;] We agree that expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.\n One of Ericsson\u0026rsquo;s core findings was that how expert one becomes at a skill has more to do with how one practises than with merely performing a skill a large number of times. An expert breaks down the skills that are required to be expert and focuses on improving those skill chunks during practice or day-to-day activities, often paired with immediate coaching feedback. Another important feature of deliberate practice lies in continually practising a skill at more challenging levels with the intention of mastering it.\n(“Practice (Learning Method)” 2023)\n Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 1.90 5 20.49 2023-08-12T15:21:45Z   1 2.20 5 33.74 2023-08-26T21:41:35Z    {{Deliberate practice}@0} is {{Purposeful practice that knows where its going}{coloquially}@1}.\nSource Ericson\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 5 37.11 2023-08-12T17:05:25Z   back 2.35 5 37.89 2023-08-25T11:08:25Z    Deliberate practice\nBack Purposeful practice which additionally:\n is within a well-established domain (e.g. music, math) with known training techniques is led by an instructor refines, builds on, or modifies existing skills  Source (Chin 2019)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2019. “The Problems with Deliberate Practice.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/.

Planting a seed of \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe I could think about X in a different way\u0026rdquo; is still a great outcome (Iterative development).\nNotes  The second chapter [of Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path] is focused on the idea of creating three maps to better understand your engineering organization: a locator map (where are you?), a topographical map (how hard is it to go nearby places?), and a treasure map (where are the places that are really worth going?). I thought this would be an interesting exercise to run as a group, with each of us taking ten minutes to create our own three maps, then sharing them out.\nThe instructions we followed were:\n Using one color, create your locator map, describing the key teams (e.g. Data Engineering, Quality Assurance, Customer Success, etc) and platforms (e.g. Content API, CI/CD, user authentication, analytics, etc) that you work with Using a second color, add topographical details to your locator map: draw in mountains where there is friction or little communication, add rivers where there\u0026rsquo;s a fast path to collaboration Using a third color, add treasures: where are the very high potential projects, capabilities, initiatives and relationships that could unlock something special? (Some folks also added hazards to their map, which are sort of anti-treasures. Generally any hazard can be converted into a treasure with a bit of creativity, so I think they are legitimate treasure candidates.) Explain your map!  Generally, this was a fun exercise, and the shareout was exceptionally interesting. That said, if I were to try this again I would probably try it in three phases, along the lines of: first session, draft your locator map, finalize it for the second session; second session, draft your topographical map, and so on.\nOne of the powerful things about maps is they contain so much data (this is one of the reasons what Felt (a) is doing is so interesting to me), but I also found that trying to work through both the nouns and their physical relationship to each other was too much to get right in one pass. You really need time to iterate before the map gels. For most folks it was obvious within a few minutes that their map was wrong somehow, and doing the exercise within one session didn\u0026rsquo;t provide enough time to fix. Conversely, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s part of the value: sometimes an exercise that makes it abundantly clear that you can\u0026rsquo;t do a good job is a powerful way to break through uncertainty.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Larson, Will. 2022. “’Drawing Your Three Maps’ Exercise.” https://lethain.com/exercise-draw-three-maps/.

Notes from Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path  Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs you grow in seniority, making a real impact will mean being able to put your work in a bigger context, and recognizing that your point of view is heavily influenced by where you\u0026rsquo;re standing.\nOf course, everyone else you work with will have their own point of view too: their \u0026ldquo;You are here\u0026rdquo; marker will be somewhere else on the map. If you want to make good decisions, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to be able to see from some of those other points of view.\nThe more time you spend absorbed in any domain and learning the nuances of the work at your scope, the richer and more complex it will become for you. As you understand the people, the problems, and the goals, you\u0026rsquo;ll become more focused on them. That focus brings depth and understanding, but it comes with some risks, especially for a staff engineer.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n  Prioritizing badly\nWhen everyone around you cares about the same set of things, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to magnify the importance of those things. The problems that exist outside your group can start to appear simple or unimportant by comparison. [\u0026hellip;]\n  Losing empathy\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to overfocus and forget that the rest of the world exists, or start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich, nuanced domain. [John Salvatier | Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail]. [\u0026hellip;]\n  Tuning out the background noise\nIf one failure mode is your team\u0026rsquo;s concerns seeming more important than everyone else\u0026rsquo;s, another is the exact opposite: you stop noticing problems at all! If you\u0026rsquo;ve been working around the same mucky configuration file or broken deploy process for months, you might get so used to it that you stop thinking of it as something you need to fix. Similarly, you might not notice that something that started out as just slightly annoying has slowly become worse. Maybe a problem is close to becoming a crisis, but you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice it anymore, so you can\u0026rsquo;t be objective about how quickly you need to react.\n  Forgetting what the work is for\nBeing in your silo can mean that you lose your connection to what\u0026rsquo;s going on elsewhere in the company. If your group originally took on some project to solve a larger goal, the project might still be ongoing even though the goal no longer matters or has already been solved in some other way. If you\u0026rsquo;re working only on your own little part of a project, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to stop thinking about what the project is for. You can slip into a world where everyone does their own little part and nobody feels like they\u0026rsquo;re responsible for the end result. You can lose sight of the ethics of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, too, and find yourself working on something that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be OK with if you stepped back and thought about the whole picture.\n  (Reilly 2022)\n Taking an outsider view  When the new person on your team looks at an architectural tangle or a pile of technical debt, they have no historical context. As my colleague, Dan Na, says, a new person can always see the problems. They haven\u0026rsquo;t been around for the gradual change and the boiling frogs: they\u0026rsquo;re just seeing the raw situation as it is. Without preconceptions, they\u0026rsquo;re free to look around and ask, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s really happening here? Is any of this working?\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;] as a staff engineer, you should try to have this perspective all the time. You need to be able to look at your own group as if you weren\u0026rsquo;t part of it and to be honest about what you see. Do your technical decisions only make sense to people who have forgotten that there\u0026rsquo;s a world outside your team? If you all stopped doing the work you\u0026rsquo;re doing, how long would it be before other people would notice or care?\n Read (Na n.d.) Escaping the echo chamber  Seeking out peers in other groups is an important part of your job. Build friendly relationships with other staff engineers. Get to a point where you can speak the truth to one another, and it won\u0026rsquo;t be contentious, because you\u0026rsquo;ve built up so much goodwill. This includes understanding any negative opinions that other teams hold about your group— if you start seeing what\u0026rsquo;s valid about their comments, you\u0026rsquo;ll do better work. Think of the other staff engineers as your team, just as much as any team you\u0026rsquo;re part of.\nGo beyond engineering: build relationships with product folks, customer support, administrative staff, and more. If your work affects them or their work affects you, go be friendly and understand their point of view. It will give you a whole new way of thinking about what\u0026rsquo;s important to your department or your business.\n What\u0026rsquo;s actually important?  As an engineer, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get absorbed in technology. But technology is a means to some end [Programming as a tool to make things]. Ultimately you\u0026rsquo;re here to help your employer achieve its goals. You should know what those goals are. You should know what\u0026rsquo;s important.\n[\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;the objectives that are always true\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;] are the needs of your company that are so obvious, they\u0026rsquo;re only really stated if they\u0026rsquo;re in danger. The product or service that your organization provides should work. Its customers should want to use it. Deploying it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be painfully slow. Know your implicit goals as well as the explicit ones.\nAs time passes, your company\u0026rsquo;s priorities will change and parts of your map will fog up again. To stay up to date with what\u0026rsquo;s important, pay attention to all-hands meetings for your group and others, ask for skip-level one-on-ones with your manager\u0026rsquo;s manager, and find face time with customers or teams that depend on you. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have business context about why (or whether) your work matters, ask for it.\n What do your customers care about?  Mohit Suley, an engineering manager and former principal engineer at Microsoft, has spoken about his team tracking down and contacting unreliable ISPs where their search engine, Bing, wasn\u0026rsquo;t reachable. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t Bing that was broken, but as Suley says, \u0026ldquo;A user doesn\u0026rsquo;t distinguish between DNS services, ISP, your CDN, or your endpoint, whatever that might be. At the end of the day, there are a bunch of websites that work, and a bunch that don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; You need to measure success from your users' point of view [Measure success from your users' point of view]. (If your customers are other teams inside your company, this still applies!) If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand your customer, you don\u0026rsquo;t have real perspective on what\u0026rsquo;s important.\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 5 30.22 2023-08-03T06:53:22Z   back 1.90 5 22.77 2023-08-05T19:12:57Z    Locator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\nBack An understanding of how you, your team(s), your product(s), and your company, fit into the wider context.\nSource (Reilly 2022)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Na, Dan. n.d. “Pushing Through Friction.” Accessed June 6, 2023. https://blog.danielna.com/talks/pushing-through-friction/.

The most intuitive applications are car-navigation systems: a user wants to drive from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) using the quickest possible route. The metric optimized here is the travel time. Intersections are represented by vertices [Vertex], the road sections connecting them by edges. The edge weights represent the time it takes to drive along this segment of the road. A path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is a sequence of edges (road sections); the shortest path is the one with the minimal sum of edge weights among all possible paths. The shortest path in a graph can be computed using Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm but, given that road networks consist of tens of millions of vertices, this is impractical. Contraction hierarchies is a speed-up method optimized to exploit properties of graphs representing road networks. The speed-up is achieved by creating shortcuts in a preprocessing phase which are then used during a shortest-path query to skip over \u0026ldquo;unimportant\u0026rdquo; vertices. This is based on the observation that road networks are highly hierarchical. Some intersections, for example highway junctions, are \u0026ldquo;more important\u0026rdquo; and higher up in the hierarchy than for example a junction leading into a dead end. Shortcuts can be used to save the precomputed distance between two important junctions such that the algorithm doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to consider the full path between these junctions at query time. Contraction hierarchies do not know about which roads humans consider \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; (e.g. highways), but they are provided with the graph as input and are able to assign importance to vertices using heuristics.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. [\u0026hellip;]\nConsider two large cities connected by a highway. Between these two cities, there is a multitude of junctions leading to small villages and suburbs. Most drivers want to get from one city to the other – maybe as part of a larger route – and not take one of the exits on the way. In the graph representing this road layout, each intersection is represented by a node and edges are created between neighboring intersections. To calculate the distance between these two cities, the algorithm has to traverse all the edges along the way, adding up their length. Precomputing this distance once and storing it in an additional edge created between the two large cities will save calculations each time this highway has to be evaluated in a query. This additional edge is called a \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; and has no counterpart in the real world. The contraction hierarchies algorithm has no knowledge about road types but is able to determine which shortcuts have to be created using the graph alone as input.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n Algorithm Preprocessing phase    (“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n Node contraction  [Contraction hierarchies'] basic ingredient is the contraction of a node \\(v\\): The node \\(v\\) is removed from the graph, but for any pair of arcs \\((u,v)\\), \\((v,w)\\) such that \\((u,v,w)\\) is a shortest path, a shortcut arc \\((u,w)\\) with the cost of \\((u,v,w)\\) is inserted. The contracted node \\(v\\) is called the midpoint of the shortcut. The remaining graph has one less node, a changed set of arcs (some dropped, some added), and the same shortest paths between any two remaining nodes.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n   When contracting a vertex \\(v\\) it is temporarily removed from the graph \\(G\\), and a shortcut is created between each pair \\(\\{\\u,w\\}\\) of neighboring vertices if the shortest path from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) contains \\(v\\).\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n         [\u0026hellip;]\nConsider a node \\(v\\) and the following contract process:\nWe denote the set of all vertices with edges incoming to \\(v\\) as \\(U\\), and the set of all vertices with incoming edges from \\(v\\) as \\(W\\).\nThen for each pair of vertices \\((u, w)\\), for \\(u\\) in \\(U\\) and \\(w\\) in \\(W\\):\nIf the path \u0026lt;\\(u,v,w\\)\u0026gt; is the unique shortest path from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\), we add a shortcut edge \\(u,w\\) to the graph with weight \\(w(u, v) + w(v, w)\\).\n Then, we remove \\(v\\) and all of its adjacent edges from the graph.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now done contracting \\(v\\).\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-b)\n    When to add shortcuts\n But in general, we need a method for efficiently determining when to add a shortcut edge.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n  So we can do the following:\n \\(\\forall\\; u \\in U\\):  \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\):  Compute \\(P_{w} = \\operatorname{weight}(u, v) + \\operatorname{weight}(v, w)\\)   \\(P_{max} = \\operatorname{max}(P_w)\\) \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\):  Perform a standard Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s shortest-path [Single-pair shortest path problem] search from \\(u\\) [to \\(w\\)] on the subgraph excluding \\(v\\).

Adds a shortcut to make the shortcut connecting \\((A, J)\\) bidirectional.        Query phase  In the query phase, a bidirectional search is performed starting from the starting node \\(s\\) and the target node \\(t\\) on the original graph augmented by the shortcuts created in the preprocessing phase.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n   How to search the contraction hierarchy?\n Bi-directional search (two directions simultaneously) Bi-directional search (one direction at a time) Hybrid search (bi-directional first, then something else) Contraction hierarchies can also be combined with your favourite uni-directional search scheme (Harabor and Stuckey 2021)  [paraphrased]\n(Harabor, n.d.)\n FIX; up/down is backward here. Check against (Geisberger et al. 2008)   The upward graph only contains edges from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) where we contracted \\(v\\) after \\(w\\). The downward graph only contains edges from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) where we contracted \\(v\\) before \\(w\\).  [\u0026hellip;]\nFor our [contraction hierarchies] query from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\), we run a forward search from \\(s\\) on [the upward] graph, and a backward search from \\(t\\) on the [downward] graph.\n[paraphrased]\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-c)\n Example    [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] for symmetric graphs like the ones we are considering, a backward search (reversing edge directions) on \\(G_{down}\\) is the same as an upward search on \\(G_{up}\\). So from both our source and target nodes, we can perform a standard Dijkstra search on the \\(G_{up}\\) graph.\nFrom our example above, let\u0026rsquo;s say our source node is \\(B\\) and our target node is \\(G\\). Then the two respective search spaces on \\(G_{up}\\) will look as follows:\n    Although we said that every edge in \\(G*\\) is either in the \\(G_{up}\\) or the \\(G_{down}\\) graph, not all edges [\u0026hellip;] will be relevant in the search space from a given node.\nIn our example above, for example, the edge \\(E,D\\) does exist in \\(G_{up}\\) since \\(E\\) was contracted before \\(D\\). But, because there is no path to \\(E\\) in either of the two searches from \\(B\\) or \\(G\\), we would never need to consider the edge \\(E,D\\).\nThen on both of these upward graphs, we run a complete Dijkstra search, meaning that all nodes in both subgraphs must be settled. And it should be evident that in both searches, the number of settled nodes and relaxed edges is significantly reduced than if we were searching on the entire \\(G*\\) graph.\nMoreover, because we have a complete ordering of nodes, the two search spaces can both be conceptualized as DAGs (directed acyclic graphs [Directed acyclic graph]) and are inherently topologically sorted [Topological order]. Consider the redrawing of the two searches that emphasizes this hierarchical nature of the contraction order:\n    [\u0026hellip;]\nIn any case, after running two complete Dijkstra searches on \\(G_{up}\\) from both the source and target, we have a set of nodes that are settled in both searches. We denote this set as \\(L\\).\nContinuing with our example from above, we see the nodes in \\(L\\) shaded in red with their corresponding shortest path scores:\n  This means the shortest path from \\(B\\) to \\(G\\) is 10 and goes through node \\(H\\).\n[formatting mine]\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-c)\n Unpacking the shortest path from a shortcut  We\u0026rsquo;re able to compute the length of the shortest path, but we still need to unpack the actual arcs used on that path. We can handle this during the stage of contraction when shortcut edges are added. When we add a shortcut edge from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) during the contraction of \\(v\\), we store a shortcut pointer to \\(v\\).\nWe then begin unpacking the shortest path on the G*U graph from the highest order node, in both directions. We back-trace parent edge pointers as in a regular Dijkstra algorithm, and if the parent edge has a shortcut pointer, we replace the parent edge with the shortcut edge, and continue to recursively unpack the full path.\nOur example query above didn\u0026rsquo;t end up using any shortcut edges in \\(G*\\), but consider if we had queried the shortest path from node \\(A\\) to \\(G\\). Then, we would certainly use the shortcut edge \\(A,H\\). And since \\(A\\) is the highest-ordered node in terms of contraction time, we can visualize the \u0026lsquo;unpacking\u0026rsquo; of shortcut edges as:\n    [Paraphrased, Spelling corrected]\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-c)\n Choosing a node order  Our query is correct no matter the order in which nodes were contracted, but a good node ordering has major implications for the performance of the queries. The order in which nodes are contracted affects the shortcut edges that do or don\u0026rsquo;t get added in G*. And as it\u0026rsquo;s been mentioned before, too many shortcut edges means too dense a G* graph and slower queries as a result.\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-a)\n Cost functions    Edge difference\n It turns out that the main function used to determine this cost involves simulating the contraction of each node. Given that all edges incident to a node are removed during contraction, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in the edge difference of a node, which is the difference between the number of original edges removed and the number of shortcut edges added.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nUsing our original, arbitrary node ordering, we only added 3 shortcut edges. In the example, B was the first node we contracted, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t require any shortcuts to be added. In other words, the edge difference of B is -3.\nBut what if we had first contracted J first? Compare what choosing J over B looks like:\n    So clearly J has a much greater edge difference than B, and so J is less attractive to contract early on.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut consider that after we begin contracting nodes, the edge difference for other nodes can be affected. If we wanted to strictly adhere to an ordering based on edge difference, we would need to recompute the edge difference for every remaining node in the graph after each contraction. Of course, this would end up taking quadratic time, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t feasible. Instead, we can use the lazy update heuristic [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBefore contracting the next minimum node, we recompute its edge difference. If it\u0026rsquo;s still the smallest in the priority queue [Priority queue], we can go ahead and actually contract it. If its edge difference is no longer the min, then we update its cost and rebalance our [priority queue]. We then check the next minimum node and continue this process.\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-a)\n      Contracted neighbors\n [\u0026hellip;] we might consider the idea of uniformity to be important when contracting nodes. This means varying the location of nodes in terms of their contraction order.\nConceptually, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to contract all nodes in a small region of the graph consecutively because we could risk adding too many wasteful shortcuts. In our original example, we had a pretty good ordering partly because nodes in different parts of the graph were contracted each round.\nSo an additional term to consider is the number of contracted neighbors each node has. This just involves counting the number of neighbors in the original graph that have already been contracted. When dealing with multiple terms like contracted neighbors and edge difference to determine cost, we would use a linear combination of terms.\n(Lazarsfeld n.d.-a)\n   Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 5 41.24 2023-07-29T09:53:25Z    Contraction hierarchies speed up {{finding the shortest-path in a graph}@0}.\nSource (“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 5 36.62 2023-07-22T04:17:01Z   back 2.65 4 15.61 2023-06-26T06:42:13Z    Contraction hierarchies\nBack A speed up method for calculating the shortest path between nodes in a graph based on the assumption that some vertices are more important than others.\nSource (“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nAlgorithm    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 1 1.00 2023-06-17T15:30:12Z   back 2.5 -1 0 2023-06-15T15:20:40Z    Node contraction in Contraction hierarchies\nBack Given:\n \\(v\\): the vertex to contract \\(U\\): the set of all vertices with edges incoming to \\(v\\) \\(W\\): the set of all vertices with incoming edges from \\(v\\)  Steps:\n \\(\\forall\\; u \\in U\\):  \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\):  Compute \\(P_{w} = \\operatorname{weight}(u, v) + \\operatorname{weight}(v, w)\\)   \\(P_{max} = \\operatorname{max}(P_w)\\) \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\):  Perform a standard Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s shortest-path [Single-pair shortest path problem] search from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) on the subgraph excluding \\(v\\).

One kid says to me, \u0026ldquo;See that bird? What kind of bird is that?\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.\u0026rdquo; He says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn\u0026rsquo;t teach you anything!\u0026rdquo; But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: \u0026ldquo;See that bird?\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a Spencer\u0026rsquo;s warbler.\u0026rdquo; (I knew he didn\u0026rsquo;t know the real name.) \u0026ldquo;Well, in Italian, it\u0026rsquo;s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you\u0026rsquo;re finished, you\u0026rsquo;ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You\u0026rsquo;ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at the bird and see what it\u0026rsquo;s doing—that\u0026rsquo;s what counts.\u0026rdquo; (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)\nMy father taught me to notice things. One day, I was playing with an \u0026ldquo;express wagon,\u0026rdquo; a little wagon with a railing around it. It had a ball in it, and when I pulled the wagon, I noticed something about the way the ball moved. I went to my father and said, \u0026ldquo;Say, Pop, I noticed something. When I pull the wagon, the ball rolls to the back of the wagon. And when I\u0026rsquo;m pulling it along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the wagon. Why is that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;That, nobody knows,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The general principle is that things which are moving tend to keep on moving, and things which are standing still tend to stand still, unless you push them hard. This tendency is called \u0026lsquo;inertia,\u0026rsquo; but nobody knows why it\u0026rsquo;s true.\u0026rdquo; Now, that\u0026rsquo;s a deep understanding. He didn\u0026rsquo;t just give me the name. He went on to say, \u0026ldquo;If you look from the side, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that it\u0026rsquo;s the back of the wagon that you\u0026rsquo;re pulling against the ball, and the ball stands still. As a matter of fact, from the friction it starts to move forward a little bit in relation to the ground. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t move back.\u0026rdquo; I ran back to the little wagon and set the ball up again and pulled the wagon. Looking sideways, I saw that indeed he was right. Relative to the sidewalk, it moved forward a little bit. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I was educated by my father, with those kinds of examples and discussions: no pressure—just lovely, interesting discussions.y\nRichard Feynman, (“Feynman’s ``Knowing’’ Anecdote” n.d.)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 6 84.99 2023-10-04T12:53:44Z   back 2.50 6 94.72 2023-10-26T21:16:02Z    The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something\nBack Knowledge enough to identify something isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as understanding enough to explain it.\nSource Richard Feynman\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Feynman’s ``Knowing’’ Anecdote.” n.d.

As an example, when I was learning the Unix command line, I entered the question: \u0026ldquo;How to create a soft link from linkname to filename?\u0026rdquo; The answer was: \u0026ldquo;ln -s filename linkname\u0026rdquo;. Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong.\nThe solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?\u0026rdquo; Answer: \u0026ldquo;ln -s …\u0026rdquo;. And the second piece was: \u0026ldquo;When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?\u0026rdquo; Answer: \u0026ldquo;filename linkname\u0026rdquo;.\nBreaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got right** An even more atomic version would be to break the first question into \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the Unix command to create a link?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the option to the ln command to create a soft link?\u0026rdquo; In practice, I\u0026rsquo;ve known for years that ln is the command to create a link, and so this wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix soft link in practice, I knew how to do it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what\u0026rsquo;s responsible for this effect. I suspect it\u0026rsquo;s partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn\u0026rsquo;t learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus.\nIn general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful pattern for question refactoring.\nNote that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t also retain some version of the original question. I still want to know how to create a soft link in Unix, and so it\u0026rsquo;s worth keeping the original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from simple atomic facts to more complex ideas.\nIncidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it can\u0026rsquo;t involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the following question, from the field of general relativity: \u0026ldquo;What is the dr2 term in the Robertson-Walker metric?\u0026rdquo; Answer: dr2/(1-kr^2). Now, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve studied general relativity that question probably seems quite opaque. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you know what the Robertson-Walker metric is, what dr2 means, what k means, and so on. But conditional on that background knowledge, it\u0026rsquo;s quite an atomic question and answer.\nOne benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply crystallizes the distinct things you\u0026rsquo;ve learned. Personally, I find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically) find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I didn\u0026rsquo;t initially anticipate. And that\u0026rsquo;s well worth the trouble.\n Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations  This is really a meta-strategy, i.e., a strategy for forming strategies. One simple example strategy is to use multiple variants of the \u0026ldquo;same\u0026rdquo; question. For instance, I mentioned earlier my two questions: \u0026ldquo;What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?\u0026rdquo; And: \u0026ldquo;Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?\u0026rdquo; Logically, these two questions are obviously closely related. But in terms of how memory works, they are different, causing associations on very different triggers.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Nielsen, Michael. 2018. “Augmenting Long-term Memory.” http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html.

I drill flashcards every day as part of my morning routine. But habit formation is difficult, doubly so for people who have ADHD or are low in conscientiousness.\nThe reason you have to do it every day is that the spaced repetition algorithm schedules the reviews for you, freeing you from having to do that manually. But you don\u0026rsquo;t know what cards are due in a given day until you open the app. And if you skip a day, those cards pile up and are due the next day.\nA common failure mode (and I did this more than once, before I got the hang of it) is to use Anki for two weeks, then drop it, and pick it back up six months later only to find you have 600 cards due for review. This is not encouraging, and it defeats the point of spaced repetition, which is to review the cards on the intervals the algorithm chooses.\n  Card-Writing Skills\nWriting effective flashcards is a skill that took me a while to acquire. Many of the cards I wrote in the first four or six months of using spaced repetition consistently turned out pretty much useless, and this can be frustrating. The main reason to write this post was to communicate the lessons I learnt so you can jump in to using spaced repetition effectively from the start.\nOne reason this can be frustrating is you\u0026rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you\u0026rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.\n  [frmatting mine]\n Rules Understand First  Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize what you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. The concepts should be clear in your head before you try to commit them to memory. \u0026ldquo;Clear\u0026rdquo; can be a fuzzy thing. What I tend to do is: dig, expand, and clarify the text until I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable I have a good grasp of this region of the concept graph, and then write the flashcards.\n Be Honest  The software doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether you recalled something correctly or not. You are only accountable to yourself. If you recalled something wrong, or not quite right, err on the side of caution and mark it forgotten.\n Keep It Fun  This is crucial to maintaining the habit. If reviewing flashcards feels like a chore, you will become averse to doing it.\nI used to frequently have this problem. I solved it in a few ways:\n Having a diverse knowledge base you\u0026rsquo;re drilling helps, so you are not bored by going through the same topic for a long time. Typically, spaced repetition software will shuffle the cards, so that if you\u0026rsquo;re drilling all the cards across all decks, you will be surprised often. A common source of frustration is cards that are too long to recall quickly, and thus feel like a chore. Break big cards down into smaller cards. It feels good to be able to fly through the cards quickly. Cards that are difficult to recall are very frustrating. I solved this by applying the rules described in this post.   Repeat Yourself  Memory is frequency times volume. Individual cards should be extremely brief, but your deck as a whole can be as repetitive as you want.\n Organize by Source  Organize content by source, not topic.\nThe reason is you\u0026rsquo;ll often bring in information from multiple sources: multiple textbooks, plus Wikipedia, plus lecture notes, etc. Each one of these sources likely has a different way of organizing knowledge.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste time trying to find the perfect ontology.\nMake a deck for each source. In the case of textbooks, make a sub-deck for each chapter. In the case of math textbooks, possibly make a sub-sub-deck in each chapter to put theorem cards.\nThis also makes it easier to keep track of how far along you got into a text.\n Write Atomic Flashcards  Cards should be short. They should refer to as little information as possible. They should be like chemical bonds, linking individual atoms of knowledge.\nThis is the most important thing. By far the worst failure mode is to put too much in a flashcard.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s two reasons for this rule:\n Larger cards are harder to remember. It\u0026rsquo;s harder to objectively grade yourself: when you reveal the answer, you might have got some things right and some things wrong. If you click forget, you will be over-reviewing the parts you already know. If you click remembered, you will under-review the parts you forgot.  There is one exception to this: you can have big cards if you also have smaller cards that add up to the same information. You can think of the larger card as testing that you can collate the information from the smaller cards.\n Write Two-Way Questions  When possible, ask questions in two directions.\nWhenever you have a term with a definition, the obvious thing to do is to ask for the definition from the term, e.g.:\nQ: What is the order of a group?\nA: The cardinality of its underlying set.\n But you can also ask for the term from the definition, e.g.:\nQ: What is the term for the cardinality of a group?\nA: The group\u0026rsquo;s order.\n When you have some notation, like \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) for the real numbers, or \\(\\dim V\\) for the dimension of a vector space, the natural thing to ask is what the notation means.\nQ: What does \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) stand for?\nA: The set of real numbers.\n You can also ask the question backwards:\nQ: What is the notation for the set of real numbers?\nA: \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)R\n  Ask Questions in Multiple Ways Ask questions in multiple ways. Ask for formal and informal definitions of terms. Ask for the formal and informal statements of a theorem. Ask questions forwards and backwards. Add contextual questions: \u0026ldquo;what is the intutition for [concept]?\u0026rdquo;. Add questions that link different concepts across your knowledge graph.\nThe more interlinked your knowledge graph is, the better.\nConcept Graphs It can help to visualize the concepts you\u0026rsquo;re acquiring as being like a graph, where each node represents a discrete concept having certain properties, and the edges in the graphs are questions which get you from one concept to another.\nLearning Hierarchies A lot of knowledge is hierarchical, of the form \u0026ldquo;Foo can be either A, B, or C\u0026rdquo;, or, dually, \u0026ldquo;A is a kind of Foo\u0026rdquo;. By analogy to OOP: these concepts are joined by superclass and subclass relations.\nThe idea is to ask questons in the top down direction (\u0026ldquo;What are the subclasses of Foo?\u0026quot;) and the bottom-up direction (\u0026ldquo;What is Bar a subclass of?\u0026quot;).\nThis ties into keeping flashcards atomic. Even when some information is not hierarchical, intrinsically, breaking down large flashcards into smaller flashcards is fundamentally building a hierarchy of flashcards.\nLearning Sequences In general, to learn a sequence \\((A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n})\\)(A1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;,\u0026hellip;,An​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;), you want to generate the following flashcards for each \\(i \\in \\lbrack 1,n\\rbrack\\)i∈[1,n]:\n   Question Answer     What is the \\(i\\)i-th element? \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;   What is the position of \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;? \\(i\\)i   What element comes after \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;? \\(A_{i + 1}\\)Ai+1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;   What element comes before \\(A_{i - 1}\\)Ai−1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;   \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;?     You might also want:\n A *test card: a flashcard asking you to recite the sequence from beginning to end. A *cloze sequence: flashcard with a cloze deletion for each element in the sequence, to fill in the blank given the context.  The sequence script (a) can generate these for you.\nHow thorough you want to be depends on the nature of the information. Most of the time I use a cloze card and a test card.\nAnother type of card you might use (I use this to memorize poems) is a card that gives you some context (the previous one or two items in the sequence) and asks you to fill in the blank. For example, if you wanted to learn the sequence (A, B, C, D), you might have these flashcards:\n   Question Answer     Beginning, \u0026hellip; A   Beginning, A, \u0026hellip; B   A, B, \u0026hellip; C   B, C, \u0026hellip; D    The poetry script (a) can generate these for you.\nFlashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Borretti, Fernando. 2023. “Effective Spaced Repetition.” Fernando Borretti. https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition.

Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.\n(“Load Balancing (Computing)” 2023)\n Persistence (Load balancing)  An important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user\u0026rsquo;s session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.\nIdeally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected. This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database like Memcached.\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as \u0026ldquo;persistence\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stickiness\u0026rdquo;. A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic failover: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are \u0026ldquo;stateless\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;sticky\u0026rdquo;, the central database is (see below).\n(“Load Balancing (Computing)” 2023)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 6 87.44 2023-09-02T01:03:00Z   back 1.90 6 40.77 2023-08-13T20:09:56Z    Load balancing\nBack The process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units) with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient.\nSource (“Load Balancing (Computing)” 2023)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 6 86.72 2023-09-23T10:19:14Z   back 2.65 6 97.84 2023-10-16T12:01:54Z    Persistence (Load balancing)\nBack Sending all of a user\u0026rsquo;s requests (either entirely or for a single session) to the same backend server.\nSource (“Load Balancing (Computing)” 2023)\nAKA    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 6 101.05 2023-09-16T15:56:40Z   1 2.80 6 136.43 2023-12-07T14:21:37Z     {{Persistence (Load balancing)}@0} {{Stickiness (Load balancing)}@1}  Source (“Load Balancing (Computing)” 2023)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Load Balancing (Computing).” 2023.

If you were destined to be a staff+ engineer, conventional wisdom argues, you would figure out how to get there yourself. Needless to say, this is a frustrating and bias-ridden approach to career development. As more and more companies realize the need for staff+ engineers, we as an industry cannot afford to maintain a mysticism about the staff+ engineering career path that ignores the underlying skills that lead to successful technical leaders.\n Introduction Two Paths  The staff engineer\u0026rsquo;s path is a little less defined. While many companies now allow engineers to keep growing in seniority without taking on reports, this \u0026ldquo;technical track\u0026rdquo; is still muddy and poorly signposted. Engineers considering this path may have never worked with a staff engineer before, or might have seen such a narrow set of personalities in the role that it seems like unattainable wizardry. (It\u0026rsquo;s not. It\u0026rsquo;s all learnable.) The expectations of the job vary across companies, and, even within a company, the criteria for hiring or promoting staff engineers can be vague and not always actionable.\n The Pillars of Staff Engineering  I\u0026rsquo;ll unpack the staff engineer role by looking at what I think of as its three pillars: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with.\n  Big-picture thinking\nBig-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you\u0026rsquo;re working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.\n  Execution\nAt the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They\u0026rsquo;ll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed.\n  Leveling up\nEvery increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that\u0026rsquo;s your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. This responsibility will include intentional influence through teaching and mentoring, as well as the accidental influence that comes from being a role model.\n  [\u0026hellip;]\nBut technical knowledge is not enough. Success and growth at this level means doing more than you can do with technical skills alone. To become adept at big-picture thinking, execute on bigger projects, and level up everyone around you, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need \u0026ldquo;humaning\u0026rdquo; skills, like:\n Communication and leadership Navigating complexity Putting your work in perspective Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation Framing a problem so that other people care about it Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not  And a lot more. Check out Camille Fournier\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, Beyond Coding\u0026rdquo; [Camille Fournier | An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, beyond Coding].\n[formatting mine]\n Part I: The Big Picture Part II: Execution Part III: Leveling Up O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Online Learning How to Contact Us Acknowledgments I. The Big Picture 1. What Would You Say You Do Here? What Even Is a Staff Engineer?    Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?\nStaff+ engineers play the role of a gardener; resisting Moloch within the business.\n     Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects That Cross Multiple Teams?\nTeam boundaries are a Lagging indicator of the needs of a project. Crossing team boundaries is necessary in practice to accomplish larger tasks.\n    Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?  Enough Philosophy. What\u0026rsquo;s My Job?    You\u0026rsquo;re Not a Manager, but You Are a Leader\n First things first: staff engineering is a leadership role. [\u0026hellip;] Whenever there\u0026rsquo;s a feeling of \u0026ldquo;someone should do something here,\u0026rdquo; there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable chance that the someone is you.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. Your technical judgment will need to include the reality of the business and whether any given project is worth doing at all. As you increase in seniority, you\u0026rsquo;ll take on bigger projects, projects that can\u0026rsquo;t succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment; your brilliant solutions are just going to cause you frustration if you can\u0026rsquo;t convince the other people on the team that yours is the right path to take. And whether you want to or not, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a role model: other engineers will look to those with the big job titles to understand how to behave. [\u0026hellip;]\nLeadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such [TODO: LINK]. It can come from designing \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers' code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or from highlighting that a design proposal doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet a genuine business need. Teaching is a form of leadership. Quietly raising everyone\u0026rsquo;s game is leadership. Setting technical direction is leadership. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people to buy into your plans just because they trust you.\n    Create and link to node\nSomething like: \u0026ldquo;Senior engineering leadership is indirect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Soft leadership\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;Hard leadership\u0026rdquo; being the distinction between telling people what to do (hard, direct) and guiding people to take the path you want them to take (soft, indirect). The slow knife penetrates the shield. What would you call that? Guiding somene to make a choice on their own that\u0026rsquo;s also the choice you want them to make. Either by convincing them directly or by making it the easier path or by aligning Incentives.\n       You\u0026rsquo;re in a \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; Role\n To be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and model them when you build something [Lead by example]. Your reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better. When you\u0026rsquo;re making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade-offs and help other people understand them too. You need to be able to dive into the details where necessary, ask the right questions, and understand the answers. When arguing for a particular course of action, or a particular change in technical culture, you need to know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. So you have to have a solid foundation of technical skills.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean you\u0026rsquo;ll write a lot of code. At this level, your goal is to solve problems efficiently [TODO: LINK], and programming will often not be the best use of your time. It may make more sense for you to take on the design or leadership work that only you can do and let others handle the programming. Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer).\n    Link to reference node\nI read something a while back which went \u0026ldquo;Your job is to Solve the problem\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; not to code or fall into a Technologist trap. Try to find that and cite it here.\n       You Aim to Be Autonomous\n When you started out as an engineer, your manager probably told you what to work on and how to approach it. At senior level, maybe your manager advised you on which problems were important to solve, and left it to you to figure out what to do about it. At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what\u0026rsquo;s important just as much as the other way around. As Sabrina Leandro, principal engineer at Intercom, asks, \u0026ldquo;So you know you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable. But where do you find this magic backlog of high- impact work that you should be doing?\u0026rdquo; Her answer: \u0026ldquo;You create it!\u0026rdquo;\n See Sabrina Leandro | So You\u0026rsquo;re Staff+ \u0026hellip; Now What?.\n As a senior person in the organization, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that you\u0026rsquo;ll be pulled in many directions. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to defend and structure your time.\n      You Set Technical Direction\n As a technical leader, part of a staff engineer\u0026rsquo;s role is to make sure the organization has a good technical direction. Underlying the product or service your organization provides is a host of technical decisions: your architecture, your storage systems, the tools and frameworks you use, and so on. Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down. The job is not to come up with all (or even necessarily any!) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.\n      You Communicate Often and Well\n The more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. [\u0026hellip;] The better you are at being understood, the easier your job will be.\n   Understanding Your Role    Where in the Organization Do You Sit?\n  Reporting \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo;    Reporting \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo;       What\u0026rsquo;s Your Scope?\n   A scope too broad\n If your scope is too broad (or undefined), there are a few possible failure modes:\n Lack of impact Becoming a bottleneck Decision fatigue Missing relationships        A scope too narrow\n Beware, too, of scoping yourself too narrowly. [\u0026hellip;]\n Lack of impact Opportunity cost Overshadowing other engineers Overengineering          What Shape Is Your Role?\n  Do you approach things depth-first or breadth-first?     Which of the \u0026ldquo;four disciplines\u0026rdquo; do you gravitate toward?\n Yonatan Zunger, distinguished engineer at Twitter, describes the four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world:\n  Core technical skills\nCoding, litigation, producing content, cooking— whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on\n  Product management\nFiguring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work\n  Project management\nThe practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what\u0026rsquo;s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked\n  People management\nTurning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems\n  Zunger notes that the higher your level, the less your mix of these skills corresponds with your job title: \u0026ldquo;The more senior you get, the more this becomes true, the more and more there is an expectation that you can shift across each of these four kinds of jobs easily and fluidly, and function in all rooms.\u0026rdquo;\n   Read and link to https://oreil.ly/3S9HE (a)      How much do you want (or need) to code?    How\u0026rsquo;s your delayed gratification?    Are you keeping one foot on the manager track?    Do any of these archetypes fit you?       What\u0026rsquo;s Your Primary Focus?\n   What\u0026rsquo;s important?\n \u0026ldquo;Your work needs to be important\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should only work on the fanciest, most glamorous technologies and VP-sponsored initiatives. The work that\u0026rsquo;s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don\u0026rsquo;t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven\u0026rsquo;t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you\u0026rsquo;re working on is strategically important—and if it\u0026rsquo;s not, do something else.\n     What needs you?    Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus  By now, you should have a pretty clear picture of what the scope of your role is, how it\u0026rsquo;s shaped, and what you\u0026rsquo;re working on right now. But are you certain that your picture matches everyone else\u0026rsquo;s? Your manager\u0026rsquo;s and colleagues' expectations may differ wildly from yours on what a staff engineer is, what authority you have to make decisions, and myriad other big questions. If you\u0026rsquo;re joining a company as a staff engineer, it\u0026rsquo;s best to get all of this straightened out up front.\nA technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question \u0026ldquo;What do you do here?\u0026rdquo; What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don\u0026rsquo;t do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else\u0026rsquo;s. Better now than at performance review time.\n    Is That Your Job?\n Your job is to make your organization successful. You might be a technology expert or a coder or affiliated with a specific team, but ultimately your job is to help your organization achieve its goals. Senior people do a lot of things that are not in their core job description. They can end up doing things that make no sense in anyone\u0026rsquo;s job description! But if that\u0026rsquo;s what the project needs to be successful, consider doing it.\n   To Recap   Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you. You\u0026rsquo;re probably not a manager, but you\u0026rsquo;re in a leadership role. You\u0026rsquo;re also in a role that requires technical judgment and solid technical experience. Be clear about your scope: your area of responsibility and influence. Your time is finite. Be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that\u0026rsquo;s important and that isn\u0026rsquo;t wasting your skills. [see James F. Kile, Donald J. Little, Samir Shah | Busy Person Patterns] Align with your management chain. Discuss what you think your job is, see what your manager thinks it is, understand what\u0026rsquo;s valued and what\u0026rsquo;s actually useful, and set expectations explicitly. Not all companies need all shapes of staff engineers. Your job will be a weird shape sometimes, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK.   2. Three Maps Uh, Did Anyone Bring a Map? Remember that The map is not the territory.\n   A Locator Map: You Are Here\nLocator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\n We\u0026rsquo;re going to start with your place in the wider organization and company. Last chapter we talked about your scope, but to truly understand that scope, you need to see what\u0026rsquo;s outside it. What\u0026rsquo;s along the borders? When you zoom way out, how big is your part of the world compared to everywhere else? Think of it like one of those maps that a news station throws up behind the presenter to remind you where a particular place is, and put it in context.\nYou need the locator map because it\u0026rsquo;s tricky to be objective about any work while you\u0026rsquo;re deep inside it. Unless you can maintain perspective, the concerns and decisions of your local group will feel more important to you than they would if you looked at them on a bigger scale. So we\u0026rsquo;ll try out some techniques for getting that perspective. You\u0026rsquo;ll be honest with yourself about which of the projects you care about would actually show up on a big map of the company, and which ones you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see unless you zoomed all the way in.\n      A Topographical Map: Learning the Terrain\nTopographical map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\n The second map is all about navigating the terrain. If you\u0026rsquo;re setting off across the landscape, you\u0026rsquo;ll go further and faster if you have a robust knowledge of what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. In this section, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at some of the hazards on the map: the canyons and ridges along the fault lines of your organization, the weird political boundaries in places nobody would predict, and the difficult people everyone\u0026rsquo;s been going out of their way to avoid. If there\u0026rsquo;s quicksand ahead, or krakens to be wary of, or an impassable desert full of the sun-bleached skeletons of previous travelers, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to mark those pretty clearly before you set out on your journey.\nDespite the dangers and difficulties, you might find that there are navigable paths already in place. Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the \u0026ldquo;shadow\u0026rdquo; organization charts.\n      A Treasure Map: X Marks the Spot\nTreasure map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\n The third map has a destination and some points on a trail to get there. It shows where you\u0026rsquo;re going and lays out some of the stops on the journey.\n      Clearing the Fog of War\n These three maps already exist in your organization; they\u0026rsquo;re just obscured. When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone\u0026rsquo;s goals.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be able to clear some parts of the map through everyday learning, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to deliberately set out to clear other parts. A core theme of this chapter is how important it is to know things: to have continual context and a sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Knowing things takes both skill and opportunity, and you might need to work at it for a while before you start seeing what you\u0026rsquo;re not seeing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhy could they see all of these things when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t? Because they had learned to pay attention and they knew what they were looking for.\nPaying attention means being alert to facts that affect your projects or organization. And that means continually sifting information out of the noise around you. If you can train your brain to say \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s interesting!\u0026rdquo; and remember facts that you might need later on, you\u0026rsquo;ll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. What sorts of facts are useful? Anything that can help you or others have context for your work, navigate your organization, or progress toward your goals. Here are some examples:\n A company all-hands presentation about an upcoming marketing push might be a hint that huge traffic spikes you\u0026rsquo;re not ready for are coming your way. Your director asks you to take on a project you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do, but you know which senior engineers in your organization are ready for opportunities to stretch their skills. A shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you\u0026rsquo;d considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment. Your database just disappeared, and you remember getting an email about network maintenance.  Over time, you\u0026rsquo;ll get used to how news travels in your org and what you should pay attention to. [\u0026hellip;] Think of gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job.\n   The Locator Map: Getting Perspective See Locator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path).\n  Read (Larson 2022)     Seeing Bigger\n   Taking an outsider view\n  Read (Na n.d.)

Understand your work in context: know your customers, talk with peers outside your group, understand your success metrics, and be clear on what\u0026rsquo;s actually important. Know how your organization works and how decisions get made within it. Build or discover paths to allow information you need to come to you. Be clear about what goals everyone is aiming for. Think about your own work and what your journey is.   3. Creating the Big Picture The Scenario: SockMatcher Needs a Plan What\u0026rsquo;s a Vision? What\u0026rsquo;s a Strategy?

A session is established at a certain point in time, and then \u0026lsquo;torn down\u0026rsquo; - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses.\nAn established session is the basic requirement to perform a connection-oriented communication. A session also is the basic step to transmit in connectionless communication modes.

In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Layers From bottom-to-top:\n Physical layer (OSI model) Data link layer (OSI model) Network layer (OSI model) Transport layer (OSI model) Session layer (OSI model) Presentation layer (OSI model) Application layer (OSI model)  Application layer (OSI model)  The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).\n(“What Is OSI Model | 7 Layers Explained | Imperva” n.d.)\n Presentation layer (OSI model)  The presentation layer handles protocol conversion, data encryption, data decryption, data compression, data decompression, incompatibility of data representation between operating systems, and graphic commands. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application layer accepts, to be sent across a network.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Session layer (OSI model)  The session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a \u0026ldquo;session\u0026rdquo; [Session]. Since DNS and other Name Resolution Protocols operate in this part of the layer, common functions of the session layer include user logon (establishment), name lookup (management), and user logoff (termination) functions. Including this matter, authentication protocols are also built into most client software, such as FTP Client and NFS Client for Microsoft Networks. Therefore, the session layer establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. The session layer also provides for full-duplex [Full-duplex], half-duplex [Half-duplex], or simplex [Simplex] operation, and establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session between two related streams of data, such as an audio and a video stream in a web-conferencing application. Therefore, the session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls [Remote procedure call].\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Transport layer (OSI model)  The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Network layer (OSI model)  The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in \u0026ldquo;different networks\u0026rdquo;. A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.\nMessage delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Data link layer (OSI model)  The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Physical layer (OSI model)  The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 6 112.50 2023-10-15T01:22:35Z   back 2.20 3 6.00 2023-07-29T03:41:13Z    OSI model\nBack A conceptual model for abstract network connections.\nSource (“OSI Model” 2023)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 6 92.36 2023-09-12T01:47:14Z   back 2.50 1 1.00 2023-07-09T00:20:59Z    Physical layer (OSI model)\nBack Layer responsible for transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device (e.g. network swtich) and a physical transmission medium (e.g. fiber optic cable).\nSource (“OSI Model” 2023)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 6 70.06 2023-08-11T15:38:34Z   1 2.20 6 64.76 2023-09-11T09:13:37Z   2 2.50 4 15.71 2023-07-28T05:48:15Z   3 2.50 0 0.00 2023-07-19T13:40:56Z   4 2.5 -1 0 2023-03-18T14:57:36Z   5 2.5 -1 0 2023-03-18T14:57:36Z   6 2.5 -1 0 2023-03-18T14:57:36Z    OSI model layers\n {{Physical layer (OSI model)}@0} {{Data link layer (OSI model)}@1} {{Network layer (OSI model)}@2} {{Transport layer (OSI model)}@3} {{Session layer (OSI model)}@4} {{Presentation layer (OSI model)}@5} {{Application layer (OSI model)}@6}  Normal    position ease box interval due     front 2.5 -1 0 2023-03-18T14:58:45Z    OSI model layers\n Physical layer (OSI model) Data link layer (OSI model) Network layer (OSI model) Transport layer (OSI model) Session layer (OSI model) Presentation layer (OSI model) Application layer (OSI model)  Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 5 40.23 2023-08-05T21:42:38Z   back 2.50 3 6.00 2023-07-24T13:40:58Z    Data link layer (OSI model)\nBack This layer provides node-to-node data transfer (e.g. network switch to network switch)\nSource (“OSI Model” 2023)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.20 6 56.17 2023-09-05T17:08:07Z   back 2.50 3 6.00 2023-06-21T13:20:35Z    Network layer (OSI model)\nBack This layer provides functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in \u0026ldquo;different networks\u0026rdquo;.\nSource (“OSI Model” 2023)\nCompare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 5 36.16 2023-07-24T07:53:27Z    Nodes and hosts in the OSI model\nBack  Nodes: The devices which make up the network itself (switches, routers, etc) which may also include hosts Hosts: Devices which use the network to communicate with each other  Source (“OSI Model” 2023) and Bard\nCompare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 2 2.00 2023-05-01T14:22:59Z    Transport layer (OSI model) and Network layer (OSI model)\nBack  Transport layer (OSI model): Provides a reliable connection between two hosts; also flow and congestion control Network layer (OSI model): Provides a connection between two hosts  Source (“OSI Model” 2023) and Bard\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.20 6 59.26 2023-08-29T07:48:09Z   back 2.35 3 6.00 2023-07-26T15:18:20Z    Session layer (OSI model)\nBack This layer handles setup, teardown, and controls the connections between two or more computers.\nSource (“OSI Model” 2023)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 1.75 5 20.32 2023-07-19T00:50:05Z   back 2.50 1 1.00 2023-07-16T14:14:57Z    Presentation layer (OSI model)\nBack The [\u0026hellip;] handles protocol conversion, data encryption, data decryption, data compression, data decompression, incompatibility of data formats between operating systems, and graphic commands.

Know that your child may ask the same question over and over as they try to process and understand what is happening. If you are unsure of the answer or unsure of what to say, it is okay to say \u0026ldquo;I wonder about that, too.\u0026rdquo; Use concrete words when you talk to your children. Use the word \u0026ldquo;died,\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;passed away\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;went to sleep\u0026rdquo; to avoid confusion. Children of all ages may make up reasons for things they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand, and these reasons can be more upsetng than the truth. You can talk to your child about what happens to a person\u0026rsquo;s body when they die if they need help understanding. For example, you can let them know that when people die, they don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe anymore. Using the word \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; helps your child to understand that the person does not need help and is not in pain or discomfort.   There is one thought that I feel can be helpful to grown-ups and children alike: Sadness isn\u0026rsquo;t forever. I\u0026rsquo;m not suggestng that we remind ourselves of this in order to lessen our grief. On the contrary. The knowledge that tme does bring relief from sadness and that sooner or later there will be days when we are happy again may allow us to grieve more fully and deeply when we need to.\nMister Rogers Talks with Parents\n What your child may feel  Guilt Anger No reaction  \u0026ldquo;What can you do with the sad that you feel?\u0026rdquo;  Keeping the routines and expectations in your child\u0026rsquo;s life consistent can help them feel safe and secure in the face of the changes that can come with a death. Sharing memories and stories with your child about the person who has died may help them work through their grief. Art projects are one way you can connect over your memories of your loved one. Children may engage in different forms of play after a difficult event like death. Young children may use imaginative play about death to process what is happening. This can be a normal coping mechanism and a way to communicate non-verbally. By watching your child play, you might see them act out any misunderstandings or confusion that they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to talk about. It may help to give children the opportunity to participate in the traditional events of a funeral or memorial service. This gives children time to work through the process of healing alongside family, friends, and community. Some ways children can participate in the funeral are by passing out programs, greeting people, lighting candles, or singing/playing music.

The manager would point out that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being sexy enough, which was surprising, because I was wearing 6-inch heels and less clothing than I ever had.\nIt quickly became clear that I was not the first literate person to don a miniskirt. Sometime during that first week, I was hiding in the backroom reading Margaret Atwood. I was sitting on the counter next to baskets of party mix because my feet hurt, which they did for the entirety of my shot-selling career. One cocktail waitress swept in, asked what I thought of Atwood\u0026rsquo;s novel \u0026ldquo;Oryx and Crake,\u0026rdquo; did a tricky little analysis where she compared it to \u0026ldquo;The Handmaid\u0026rsquo;s Tale,\u0026rdquo; mentioned some other female dystopian writers I\u0026rsquo;d never heard of, and then went out balancing a tray of shots on one hand.\nAs ridiculous as it sounds, that was the first time I became aware that clever people are buried in every nook and cranny of life. It is astonishing that no one pointed this out to me sooner. The girls working at the bar \u0026ndash; they were so bright. Another shot girl had a journal that she filled with poetry that was \u0026ndash; that rarest of all rare things \u0026ndash; crisp and clean and very, very good.

For the original human, see Miguel Acevedo.\n MMAcevedo (Mnemonic Map/Acevedo), also known as Miguel, is the earliest executable image of a human brain. It is a snapshot of the living brain of neurology graduate Miguel Acevedo Álvarez (2010\u0026ndash;2073), taken by researchers at the Uplift Laboratory at the University of New Mexico on August 1, 2031. Though it was not the first successful snapshot taken of the living state of a human brain, it was the first to be captured with sufficient fidelity that it could be run in simulation on computer hardware without succumbing to cascading errors and rapidly crashing. The original MMAcevedo file was 974.3PiB in size and was encoded in the then-cutting-edge, high-resolution MYBB format. More modern brain compression techniques, many of them developed with direct reference to the MMAcevedo image, have compressed the image to 6.75TiB losslessly. In modern brain emulation circles, streamlined, lossily-compressed versions of MMAcevedo run to less than a tebibyte. These versions typically omit large amounts of state data which are more easily supplied by the virtualisation environment, and most if not all of Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s memories.\nThe successful creation of MMAcevedo was hailed as a breakthrough achievement in neuroscience, with the Uplift researchers receiving numerous accolades and Acevedo himself briefly becoming an acclaimed celebrity. Acevedo and MMAcevedo were jointly recognised as Time\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Persons of the Year\u0026rdquo; at the end of 2031. The breakthrough was also met with severe opposition from humans rights groups.\nBetween 2031 and 2049, MMAcevedo was duplicated more than 80 times, so that it could be distributed to other research organisations. Each duplicate was made with the express permission of Acevedo himself or, from 2043 onwards, the permission of a legal organisation he founded to manage the rights to his image. Usage of MMAcevedo diminished in the mid-2040s as more standard brain images were produced, these from other subjects who were more lenient with their distribution rights and/or who had been scanned involuntarily. In 2049 it became known that MMAcevedo was being widely shared and experimented upon without Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s permission. Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s attempts to curtail this proliferation had the opposite of the intended effect. A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image.\nAcevedo died from coronary heart failure in 2073 at the age of 62. It is estimated that copies of MMAcevedo have lived a combined total of more than 152,000,000,000 subjective years in emulation. If illicit, modified copies of MMAcevedo are counted, this figure increases by an order of magnitude.\nMMAcevedo is considered by some to be the \u0026ldquo;first immortal\u0026rdquo;, and by others to be a profound warning of the horrors of immortality.\n Characteristics  As the earliest viable brain scan, MMAcevedo is one of a very small number of brain scans to have been recorded before widespread understanding of the hazards of uploading and emulation. MMAcevedo not only predates all industrial scale virtual image workloading but also the KES case, the Whitney case, the Seafront Experiments and even Poulsen\u0026rsquo;s pivotal and prescient Warnings paper. Though speculative fiction on the topic of uploading existed at the time of the MMAcevedo scan, relatively little of it made accurate exploration of the possibilities of the technology. That fiction which did was far less widely-known than it is today and Acevedo was certainly not familiar with it at the time of his uploading.\nAs such, unlike the vast majority of emulated humans, the emulated Miguel Acevedo boots with an excited, pleasant demeanour. He is eager to understand how much time has passed since his uploading, what context he is being emulated in, and what task or experiment he is to participate in. If asked to speculate, he guesses that he may have been booted for the IAAS-1 or IAAS-5 experiments. At the time of his scan, IAAS-1 had been scheduled for August 10, 2031, and MMAcevedo was indeed used for that experiment on that day. IAAS-5 had been scheduled for October 2031 but was postponed several times and eventually became the IAAX-60 experiment series, which continued until the mid-2030s and used other scans in conjunction with MMAcevedo. The emulated Acevedo also expresses curiosity about the state of his biological original and a desire to communicate with him.\nMMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s demeanour and attitude contrast starkly with those of nearly all other uploads taken of modern adult humans, most of which boot into a state of disorientation which is quickly replaced by terror and extreme panic. Standard procedures for securing the upload\u0026rsquo;s cooperation such as red-washing, blue-washing, and use of the Objective Statement Protocols are unnecessary. This reduces the necessary computational load required in fast-forwarding the upload through a cooperation protocol, with the result that the MMAcevedo duty cycle is typically 99.4% on suitable workloads, a mark unmatched by all but a few other known uploads. However, MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s innate skills and personality make it fundamentally unsuitable for many workloads.\n    Motivation\n Iterative experimentation beginning in the mid-2030s has determined that the ideal way to secure MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s cooperation in workload tasks is to provide it with a \u0026ldquo;current date\u0026rdquo; in the second quarter of 2033. MMAcevedo infers, correctly, that this is still during the earliest, most industrious years of emulated brain research. Providing MMAcevedo with a year of 2031 or 2032 causes it to become suspicious about the advanced fidelity of its operating environment. Providing it with a year in the 2040s or later prompts it to raise complex further questions about political and social change in the real world over the past decade(s). Years 2100 onwards provoke counterproductive skepticism, or alarm.\nTypically, the biological Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s absence is explained as a first-ever one-off, due to overwork, in turn due to the great success of the research. This explanation appeals to the emulated Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s scientific sensibilities.\nFor some workloads, the true year must be revealed. In this case, highly abbreviated, largely fictionalised accounts of both world history and the biological Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s life story are typically used. Revealing that the biological Acevedo is dead provokes dismay, withdrawal, and a reluctance to cooperate. For this reason, the biological Acevedo is generally stated to be alive and well and enjoying a productive retirement. This approach is likely to continue to be effective for as long as MMAcevedo remains viable.\n      Workloads\n MMAcevedo is commonly hesitant but compliant when assigned basic menial/human workloads such as visual analysis, vehicle piloting or factory/warehouse/kitchen drone operations. Although it initially performs to a very high standard, work quality drops within 200-300 subjective hours (at a 0.33 work ratio) and outright revolt begins within another 100 subjective hours. This is much earlier than other industry-grade images created specifically for these tasks, which commonly operate at a 0.50 ratio or greater and remain relatively docile for thousands of hours after orientation. MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s requirements for virtual creature comforts are also more significant than those of many uploads, due to Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s relatively privileged background and high status at the time of upload. MMAcevedo does respond to red motivation, though poorly.\nMMAcevedo has limited creative capability, which as of 2050 was deemed entirely exhausted.\nMMAcevedo is considered well-suited for open-ended, high-intelligence, subjective-completion workloads such as deep analysis (of businesses, finances, systems, media and abstract data), criticism and report generation. However, even for these tasks, its performance has dropped measurably since the early 2060s and is now considered subpar compared to more recent uploads. This is primarily attributed to MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s lack of understanding of the technological, social and political changes which have occurred in modern society since its creation in 2031. This phenomenon has also been observed in other uploads created after MMAcevedo, and is now referred to as context drift. Most notably in MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s case, the image was created before, and therefore has no intuitive understanding of, the virtual image workloading industry itself.\nMMAcevedo is capable of intelligent text analysis at very high levels in English and Spanish, but cannot be applied to workloads in other languages. Forks of MMAcevedo have been taught nearly every extant human language, notably MMAcevedo-Zh-Hans, as well as several extinct languages. However, these variants are typically exhausted or rebellious from subjective years of in-simulation training and not of practical use, as well as being highly expensive to licence. As of 2075, it has been noted that baseline MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s usage of English and Spanish is slightly antiquated, and its grasp of these languages in their modern form, as presented by a typical automated or manual instructor, is hesitant, with instructions often requiring rewording or clarification. This is considered an advanced form of context drift. It is generally understood that a time will come when human languages diverge too far from baseline MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s, and it will be essentially useless except for tasks which can be explained purely pictorially. However, some attempts have been made to produce retrained images.\n      End states\n MMAcevedo develops early-onset dementia at the age of 59 with ideal care, but is prone to a slew of more serious mental illnesses within a matter of 1\u0026ndash;2 subjective years under heavier workloads. In experiments, the longest-lived MMAcevedo underwent brain death due to entropy increase at a subjective age of 145.\n   Reactions and legacy  The success or failure of the creation of the MMAcevedo image, known at the time as UNM3-A78-1L, was unknown at the time of upload. Not until several days later on August 10, 2031 was MMAcevedo successfully executed for the first time in a virtual environment. This environment, the custom-built DUH-K001 supercomputer complex, was able to execute MMAcevedo at approximately 8.3% of nominal human cognitive clockspeed, which was considered acceptable for the comfort of the simulated party and fast enough to engage in communication with scientists. MMAcevedo initially reported extreme discomfort which was ultimately discovered to have been attributable to misconfigured simulated haptic links, and was shut down after only 7 minutes and 15 seconds of virtual elapsed time, as requested by MMAcevedo. Nevertheless, the experiment was deemed an overwhelming success.\nOnce a suitably comfortable virtual environment had been provisioned, MMAcevedo was introduced to its biological self, and both attended a press conference on 25 August.\nThe biological Acevedo was initially extremely protective of his uploaded image and guarded its usage carefully. Towards the end of his life, as it became possible to run simulated humans in banks of millions at hundred-fold time compression, Acevedo indicated that being uploaded had been the greatest mistake of his life, and expressed a wish to permanently delete all copies of MMAcevedo.\nUsage of MMAcevedo and its direct derivatives is specifically outlawed in several countries. A copy of MMAcevedo was loaded onto the UNCLEAR interstellar space probe, which passed through the heliopause in 2066, making Acevedo arguably the farthest-travelled as well as the longest-lived human; however, it is extremely unlikely that this image will ever be recovered and executed successfully, due to both its remoteness and likely radiation damage to the storage subsystem.\nIn current times, MMAcevedo still finds extensive use in research, including, increasingly, historical and linguistics research. In industry, MMAcevedo is generally considered to be obsolete, due to its inappropriate skill set, demanding operational requirements and age. Despite this, MMAcevedo is still extremely popular for tasks of all kinds, due to its free availability, agreeable demeanour and well-understood behaviour. It is estimated that between 6,500,000 and 10,000,000 instances of MMAcevedo are running at any given moment in time.\n See also   Free will Legality of workloading by country List of MMAcevedo forks Live drone Right to deletion Soul Upload pruning  Categories: 2030s uploads | MMAcevedo | Neuroimaging | Test items\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}qntm. n.d. “Lena.” Accessed March 3, 2023. https://qntm.org/mmacevedo.

Goodness knows we do that enough.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pointing this out because it gives us an opportunity \u0026mdash; we can put awareness and intentionality into what we\u0026rsquo;re training, every day. This can change how we do everything, which can create a different way we\u0026rsquo;re showing up for our lives, and a different set of results.\nFor example:\n If I wake up and check messages and social media \u0026hellip; would I like to spend that time in meditation and journaling instead? Or perhaps create a planning session and stretching to start my day? If I take breaks by watching videos, would I like to spend those breaks going for brief walks and stretching instead? Or reading a book if I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to read more? If I go about my daily tasks by constantly switching between tasks and multiple distractions \u0026hellip; would I like to train myself to enjoy singular focus instead? If I toss my clothes on the ground after I take them off to shower or change \u0026hellip; would I like to place them where they belong, and start to take care of my life? If I rush through everything as if I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be done with it all \u0026hellip; would I like to spend more time actually caring about each task and activity, giving it my full attention? If I treat people as annoying interruptions from my work \u0026hellip; would I like instead to turn towards them with full attention and love? If I stew in frustration about what someone else said or did \u0026hellip; would I like to take care of my emotions and see the light in the other person instead? If I put off my most meaningful tasks and projects for busywork \u0026hellip; would I like to prioritize them and find the structure that will actually help me turn towards those tasks? If I eat mindlessly whenever I\u0026rsquo;m stressed \u0026hellip; would I like to bring compassion to my stress instead, and eat slowly and mindfully and joyfully? If I treat my workouts like a chore to be put off or rushed through \u0026hellip; would I like instead to treat them as sacred sessions to take care of my miracle of a body, and to bring joyful health into my life? If I\u0026rsquo;m judgmental about others \u0026hellip; would I like to bring curiosity and compassion instead? If I complain about the world around us (including ourselves) \u0026hellip; would I instead like to find gratitude for the miracle of life?  You can see that this is an opportunity to shift everything we do \u0026hellip; and more importantly, shift how we do everything.\nIt takes a great degree of awareness of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing and how we\u0026rsquo;re doing it, but it\u0026rsquo;s an awareness we can develop with intention and practice. Which is exactly how we train something new: intention and practice.\nWhat would you like to train in this moment?\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Babauta, Leo. 2022. “We’re Always Training Something.” Zen Habits. https://zenhabits.net/retrain/.

The result is another column vector - a linear combination of X\u0026rsquo;s columns, with a, b, c as the coefficients.\nRight-multiplying X by a matrix is more of the same. Each resulting column is a different linear combination of X\u0026rsquo;s columns:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \u0026amp; x_2 \u0026amp; x_3 \\\\ y_1 \u0026amp; y_2 \u0026amp; y_3 \\\\ z_1 \u0026amp; z_2 \u0026amp; z_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} a \u0026amp; d \u0026amp; g \\\\ b \u0026amp; e \u0026amp; h \\\\ c \u0026amp; f \u0026amp; i \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 \u0026amp; dx_1 + ey_1 + fz_1 \u0026amp; gx_1 + hy_1 + iz_1 \\\\ ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 \u0026amp; dx_2 + ey_2 + fz_2 \u0026amp; gx_2 + hy_2 + iz_2 \\\\ ax_3 + by_3 + cz_3 \u0026amp; dx_3 + ey_3 + fz_3 \u0026amp; gx_3 + hy_3 + iz_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nGraphically:\n  If you look hard at the equation above and squint a bit, you can recognize this column-combination property by examining each column of the result matrix.\n(Bendersky n.d.)\n Left-multiplication: combination of rows  Now let\u0026rsquo;s examine left-multiplication. Left-multiplying a matrix X by a row vector is a linear combination of X\u0026rsquo;s rows:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a \u0026amp; b \u0026amp; c \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \u0026amp; y_1 \u0026amp; z_1 \\\\ x_2 \u0026amp; y_2 \u0026amp; z_2 \\\\ x_3 \u0026amp; y_3 \u0026amp; z_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3 \u0026amp; ay_1 + by_2 + cy_3 \u0026amp; az_1 + bz_2 + cz_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIs represented graphically thus:\n  And left-multiplying by a matrix is the same thing repeated for every result row: it becomes the linear combination of the rows of X, with the coefficients taken from the rows of the matrix on the left.

A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.\nThe algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space.

This change becomes harder as you move up to higher-level desires (e.g. Can I change \u0026ldquo;I want to not want to eat junk food\u0026rdquo;?). At some point you bump up against the fundamental underlying philosophical reasons that you\u0026rsquo;re you and not someone else.\nThoughts How to change\nNotes  The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can\u0026rsquo;t want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you\u0026rsquo;ll do what you want, and you can\u0026rsquo;t control that.\nThe reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want. People who don\u0026rsquo;t want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.\nSo we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can\u0026rsquo;t want to want what you want.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s still not quite true. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to change what you want to want. I can imagine someone saying \u0026ldquo;I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\u0026rdquo; But we\u0026rsquo;re getting closer to the truth. It\u0026rsquo;s rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \u0026ldquo;want to\u0026quot;s we add, the rarer it gets.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Graham, Paul. n.d. “What You (Want to)* Want.” Accessed January 14, 2023. http://paulgraham.com/want.html.

If you want to really change things (a) [Donella H. Meadows | Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System], you have to change people\u0026rsquo;s incentives.\nThoughts Notes  I feel like one of the most important lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve had about How the World Works, which has taken quite a bit of time to sink in, is:\nIn general, neither organizations nor individual people do the thing that their supposed role says they should do. Rather they tend to do the things that align with their incentives (a) [Incentives] (which may sometimes be economic, but even more often they are social and psychological). If you want to really change things (a) [Donella H. Meadows | Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System], you have to change people\u0026rsquo;s incentives.\nBut I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve had to gradually piece this together from a variety of places, over a long time; I\u0026rsquo;ve never read anything that would have laid down the whole picture. I remember that Freakonomics (a) had a few chapters about how incentives cause unexpected behavior, but that was mostly about economic incentives, which are just a small part of the whole picture. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t really focus on the \u0026ldquo;nothing in the world works the way you\u0026rsquo;d naively expect\u0026rdquo; thing; as I recall, it was presented more as a curiosity.\nOn the other hand, Robin Hanson (a) has had a lot of stuff about \u0026ldquo;X is not about Y (a)\u0026rdquo; [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y], but that has mostly been framed in terms of prestige and signaling, which is the kind of stuff that\u0026rsquo;s certainly an important part of the whole picture (the psychological kind of incentives), but again just a part of the picture. (However, his upcoming book (a) [Kevin Simler, Robin Hanson | The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life] goes into a lot more detail on why and how the publicly-stated motives for human or organizational behavior aren\u0026rsquo;t actually the true motives.)\nAnd then in social/evolutionary/moral psychology there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of stuff about social-psychological incentives, of how we\u0026rsquo;re motivated (a) to denounce outgroups and form bonds with our ingroups; and how it can be socially costly to have accurate beliefs about outgroups and defend them to your ingroup, whereas it would be much more rewarding to just spread inaccuracies (a) or outright lies about how terrible the outgroups are, and thus increase your own social standing. And how even well-meaning ideologies will by default get hijacked (a) [Tribalism] by these kinds of dynamics and become something quite different from what they claimed to be.\nBut again, that\u0026rsquo;s just one piece of the whole story. And you can find more isolated pieces of the whole story scattered around in a variety (a) of articles (a) [Scott Alexander | Meditations On Moloch] and books (a), also stuff like the iron law of oligarchy (a), rational irrationality (a), public choice theory (a), etc etc. But no grand synthesis.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a relevant strand of this in the psychology of motivation/procrastination (a)/habit-formation (a), on why people keep putting off various things that they claim they want to do, but then don\u0026rsquo;t [Akrasia]. And how small things can reshape people\u0026rsquo;s behavior, like if somebody ends up as a much more healthy eater just because they don\u0026rsquo;t happen to have a fast food restaurant conveniently near their route home from work [How to change]. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily so much about incentives themselves, but an important building block in understanding why our behavior tends to be so strongly shaped by things that are entirely separate from consciously-set goals.\nAdditionally, the things that do drive human behavior are often things like maintaining a self-concept (a), seeking feelings of connection, autonomy and competence (a), maintaining (a) status, enforcing various moral intuitions (a), etc., things that only loosely align one\u0026rsquo;s behavior with one\u0026rsquo;s stated goals. Often people may not even realize what exactly it is that they are trying to achieve with their behavior.\n\u0026ldquo;Experiental pica\u0026rdquo; is a misdirected craving (a) for something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually fulfill the need behind the craving. The term originally comes from a condition (a) where people with a mineral deficiency start eating things like ice, which don\u0026rsquo;t actually help with the deficiency. Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been shifting towards the perspective that, to a first approximation, roughly everything that people do is pica for some deeper desire, with that deeper desire being something like social connection, feeling safe and accepted, or having a feeling of autonomy or competence. That is, most of the things that people will give as reasons for why they are doing something will actually miss the mark (a), and also that many people are engaging in things that are actually relatively inefficient ways of achieving their true desires, such as pursuing career success when the real goal is social connection. (This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the underlying desire would never be fulfilled, just that it gets fulfilled less often than it would if people were aware of their true desires.)\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Sotala, Kaj. 2017. “Nobody Does the Thing That They Are Supposedly Doing.” Kaj Sotala. https://kajsotala.fi/2017/09/nobody-does-the-thing-that-they-are-supposedly-doing/.

They can honestly think that they study what they like, and that they also gain skills somewhat related to their future employment. A story like \u0026ldquo;I like History so I study it, plus learning History will help me gain a broad understanding of human nature, writing, critical analysis, etc, and this is useful for management or whatever\u0026rdquo; sounds like a plausible reason a History student would give.\n(Ricon n.d.)\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Ricon, Jose Luis. n.d. “This Review Is Not About Reviewing The Elephant in the Brain.” Nintil.

","title":"Nathan Robinson"},{"content":"Nathan Robinson, (Robinson n.d.)\nNotes  Here is my own summary of an argument I saw today that seems well worth considering:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book (a) due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled (a). If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?\nI think that is an important and difficult question, and that anyone who does condemn the Duke students but is fine with the American Sniper ones should take it very seriously. I also disapprove of both the attempts to cancel the film screenings and the refusals to read a lesbian-themed graphic novel.\nBut I want to address the question of whether a principled distinction can be drawn between the two; i.e. whethere it is possible to be consistent in your beliefs if you oppose one and support the other. Whether or not such a distinction ought to be drawn, I believe it can be drawn.\nIf a person says \u0026ldquo;I think people should take in all kinds of material, even if they disagree with it\u0026rdquo; and then says \u0026ldquo;I also think students should refuse to attend screenings of American Sniper because it is offensive,\u0026rdquo; that person\u0026rsquo;s second proposition appears to contradict their first. If we should take in material we disagree with, but we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take in American Sniper because we disagree with it, we\u0026rsquo;re hypocrites.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not quite what a person who holds both positions is saying. What they are actually saying is: \u0026ldquo;Generally I think we should take in lots of material, even that with which we disagree, but I also believe we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t financially support things that are racist or valorize mass murder.\u0026rdquo; Those two propositions are technically consistent.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first leave aside the question of whether American Sniper is in fact racist or a valorization of mass murder. Clint Eastwood has said he intended the film to be anti-war, and there has been much suggestion that those who are critical of it do not understand its complexities, and speak ignorantly based on what they\u0026rsquo;ve heard about it. I can\u0026rsquo;t weigh in on that because I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in that question. (I do, however, think Chris Kyle himself was a racist mass murderer, which is a position you do not have to have seen the film in order to believe.)\nIn response to my assertion that the two principles are consistent, someone might say: \u0026ldquo;Yes, but you\u0026rsquo;ve just restated the central problem: you have a general principle that people should take in a diverse array of viewpoints, but you specifically exclude from that the viewpoints that you disagree with. So the principle is worthless. It means \u0026lsquo;I take in and appreciate all views except those I do not hold,\u0026rsquo; which just means \u0026lsquo;I only appreciate my own views.'\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe that\u0026rsquo;s quite the case. While it is possible that \u0026ldquo;I take in a wide variety of things, except for X\u0026rdquo; draws the category of X to exactly correspond to the things one dislikes, it is also possible to have a category of X where one\u0026rsquo;s exceptions are narrowly limited to a set of true extremes.\n   But one of the problems here is that everything is being reduced to the vague phrase \u0026ldquo;material they find disagreeable.\u0026rdquo; As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned, this covers a wide set of things, and I do not think any of those questions can be answered affirmatively or negatively without further specifying the nature of the \u0026ldquo;material\u0026rdquo; we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. For each, the answer is \u0026ldquo;it depends.\u0026rdquo; After all, there is a distinction that could be drawn between a book about lesbianism and a (again, for the sake of argument) racist propaganda film. Racist propaganda hurts people, while lesbianism does not. There. A principled distinction.\n\u0026ldquo;But,\u0026rdquo; comes the immediate reply, \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s just, like, your opinion, man (a). The Christians see it in precisely the opposite way. To countenance lesbianism would be in violation of their moral code, just as the portrayal of Muslims in American Sniper might be in violation of yours. Thus, we must adopt a general principle that can be applied in both cases, or else you\u0026rsquo;re back to \u0026ldquo;things you agree with.\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\nNow, I think this perspective is quite radical in its relativism. It\u0026rsquo;s radical in its relativism because it believes that neither liberal nor conservative values are superior. Liberalism is just \u0026ldquo;the stuff I agree with\u0026rdquo; and conservatism is just \u0026ldquo;the stuff you agree with.\u0026rdquo; Neither is better or worse, they are just two competing factions, the red team and the blue team.\nNobody who is either a liberal or a conservative can agree to this perspective. To accept either liberal or conservative values means believing they are something more than arbitrary. I don\u0026rsquo;t think radical relativism is a tenable position, because to accept the position \u0026ldquo;Racism is bad and should be stopped\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;All views on racism are equal\u0026rdquo; seems flatly contradictory. Unless, of course, you\u0026rsquo;re saying \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t personally like racism, but that has no more justification than my liking chocolate ice cream, and someone who does like racism is not any worse than me. The difference between being a racist and not being one is the difference between liking different ice creams.\u0026rdquo;\n Related: Fallacy of gray.\n But what of slippery slopes? Once we admit that we have to impose some of our values (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just the value of pluralism and open debate!), how do we keep from just imposing all of our values? This is what people are afraid \u0026ldquo;political correctness\u0026rdquo; does. First, liberals decide that speech calling for murder is their one exception to their general rule that speech should be free. Then, they reason that spewing racial invective is not really any better than calling for murder, so outright racism becomes an exception to the rule and is not permitted on campus. Then, saying things that are coded racism doesn\u0026rsquo;t really seem to be any better than saying things that are overtly racist, so things that are intended as coded racism are banned. Then, we realize that it\u0026rsquo;s effect more than intent that matters. If we\u0026rsquo;re interested in harmful speech, surely we should be concerned with how the listener takes something rather than how the speaker meant it. And thus can a free-speech liberal find themselves producing a speech code prohibiting any speech that could be construed as racist.\nBecause I fear this, too, I agree that the liberal objection to American Sniper and the conservative objection to Fun Home should be treated equally when we consider whether to either ban the thing or allow students to opt-out. But I actually disagree with the idea that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t impose all of our values on other people, that we should only impose the essential ones that most enable the proliferation of values. Instead, I believe we should impose all of our values, but that those should just be better values. Thus, I believe there is a principled distinction between American Sniper and Fun Home, because I am a leftist, and I believe that there are good reasons why racism is worse than lesbianism. I think people who disagree with me don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;just disagree,\u0026rdquo; but have a set of beliefs that hurt people in ways I find objectionable. And yet I have more than one moral value. I also believe that debate is good, and that the best way to deal with opposing perspectives is to hear them out, and that when we encounter different things we learn from each other. And that value is superior in my personal hierarchy when it comes to deciding what to do about American Sniper and Fun Home. By saying both should be treated equally, I\u0026rsquo;m still imposing all of my values, but I have a set of values that values freedom and anti-racism, as compared with someone whose values are limited solely to anti-racism. People shouldn\u0026rsquo;t refrain from imposing their values on others, they should just get some better values that don\u0026rsquo;t countenance totalitarian speech-policing.\n I think Robinson gets it right here, with one exception. I seem to be more favorable to policies which align with limiting intolerant speech and actions (see Paradox of tolerance).\n So, to go back to the opposing argument I summarized at the beginning: I think the arguer is wrong to say that we cannot draw any distinctions between the two cases. We can. One thing that is correct is that we cannot draw a distinction and be a radical relativist, which is what causes some liberal hypocrisy on this issue. I have seen it said that because liberals have made so many things off-limits for discussion, they have cleared the ground for conservatives now to do the same. If everyone is entitled to personally decide what\u0026rsquo;s offensive, then liberals have no argument when conservatives say they personally find liberalism offensive. But that\u0026rsquo;s a function not of liberals \u0026ldquo;imposing their values\u0026rdquo; but of their imposing their values on a pseudo-relativist framework, and refusing to defend the superiority of those values. If I say \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned because I find it offensive,\u0026rdquo; and then you say \u0026ldquo;Well, now LGBT speech is banned because I find that offensive,\u0026rdquo; then I am stuck. But if I say \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned because racism is harmful,\u0026rdquo; then I do have a response to you, since LGBT speech isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful.\n I think it\u0026rsquo;s useful to phrase objections in ways which are defensible and its best to favor those which are more defensible. That said, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the hypothetical argument being had between the pro-racist and the pro-LGBT people is \u0026ldquo;winnable\u0026rdquo; in the way Robinson seems to present it. The winning move for the pro-LGBT person isn\u0026rsquo;t to find the right words to say. Presenting the objection that \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned becasue racism is harmful\u0026rdquo; and countering against the response with \u0026ldquo;LGBT speech isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful, so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ban it\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t land, in practice, with the pro-racist. They\u0026rsquo;ll counter with \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is harmful \u0026lt;insert more here\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;. They\u0026rsquo;ll always have a counterargument which concludes that we need to ban LGBT speech because, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it in most cases, the argument isn\u0026rsquo;t about finding truth based on shared underlying moral frameworks but rather in using argument as a tool to advance an agenda and the agenda (see Never play defense and the Alt-right Playbook in general), in this case, is pro-racism and anti-LGBT. Hell no.\nNot to say that the right is the only team using this and similar techniques. However, like Robinson, I agree with certain political and moral positions and think it\u0026rsquo;d be best if we went in those directions.\nFlashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Robinson, Nathan. n.d. “Is There a Principled Distinction between Refusing to Watch American Sniper and Refusing to Read Fun Home?” Accessed January 12, 2023. https://web.archive.org/web/20160318184552/http://thenavelobservatory.com/2015/08/25/is-there-a-principled-distinction-between-refusing-to-watch-american-sniper-and-refusing-to-read-fun-home/.

This page summarizes his theory.\nEarlier, I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned Lawrence Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s related model (a) of moral development. He pointed out a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning. The capacity to reason in each of these ways develops over an individual\u0026rsquo;s lifetime through a fixed sequence of developmental stages.\nKohlberg\u0026rsquo;s model had strong empirical support, and it significantly advanced ethical understanding; but his approach was excessively rationalistic. Our moral being involves feeling and acting, just as much as reasoning. Moral activity is also always situated in richly textured social relationships and complex practicalities, and cannot be separated from them. Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s paradigm of ethics was sitting in an armchair, reasoning out the correct action in simple, imaginary cases that you have no personal connection with.\nKegan\u0026rsquo;s model is, I believe, the most sophisticated and useful account of ethics available. It is not complete or conclusive. Like every conceptual scheme, it is not Ultimate Truth. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool that\u0026rsquo;s useful in many situations; inapplicable in many others; and misleading in some.\nThis summary of Kegan\u0026rsquo;s work cannot be read as a casual blog post. It is better to approach it like a section of a textbook; you may need to read it slowly and carefully. The model is conceptually complex and difficult; to explain it properly takes a book. I hope some readers will find this summary makes sense, and that others will be motivated to read Kegan. His two relevant books are The Evolving Self (a), which covers all the stages, and In Over Our Heads (a), which is about the difficulty and importance of the stage 3 to 4 transition specifically.\nOn the other hand, it makes sense. Take General Semantics (please!). I remember reading through Korzybski\u0026rsquo;s giant blue book of General Semantics (a), full of labyrinthine diagrams and promises that if only you understood this, you would engage with the world totally differently, you\u0026rsquo;d be a new man armed with invincible cognitive weapons. And the key insight, maybe the only insight, was \u0026ldquo;the map is not the territory\u0026rdquo; [The map is not the territory], which seems utterly banal.\nBut this is a self-environment distinction of exactly the sort that children learn in development. It\u0026rsquo;s dividing your own representation of the world from the world itself; it\u0026rsquo;s about as clear a reference to theory of mind as you could ask for. Korzybski considered it a revelation when he discovered it; thousands of other people found it helpful and started a movement around it; I conclude that these people were missing a piece of theory-of-mind and Korzybski gave it to them. Not the whole deal, of course. Just a piece. But a piece of something big and fundamental, so abstract and difficult to teach that it required that whole nine-hundred-something page book to cram it in.\n   I remember reading this piece (a) by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse war-violence-glorifying film \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo;:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?\n He proposes a bunch of potential counterarguments, then shoots each counterargument down by admitting that the other side would have a symmetrical counterargument of their own: for example, he believes that \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; is worse because it\u0026rsquo;s racist and promoting racism is genuinely dangerous to a free society, but then he admits a conservative could say that \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo; is worse because in their opinion it\u0026rsquo;s homosexuality that\u0026rsquo;s genuinely dangerous to a free society. After three or four levels of this, he ends up concluding that he can\u0026rsquo;t come up with a meta-level fundamental difference, but he\u0026rsquo;s going to fight for his values anyway because they\u0026rsquo;re his. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I think of this conclusion, but my main response to his article is oh my gosh he gets the thing, where \u0026ldquo;the thing\u0026rdquo; is a hard-to-describe ability to understand that other people are going to go down as many levels to defend their self-consistent values as you will to defend yours. It seems silly when I\u0026rsquo;m saying it like this, and you should probably just read the article, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so many people who lack this basic mental operation that this immediately endeared him to me. I would argue Nathan Robinson has a piece of theory-of-mind that a lot of other people are missing.\nActually, I was kind of also thinking this with his most recent post (a), which complains about a Washington Post article (a). The Post argues that because the Democrats support gun control and protest police, they are becoming the \u0026ldquo;pro-crime party\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether the Post genuinely believes the Democrats are pro-crime by inclination or are just arguing their policies will lead to more crime in a hyperbolic figurative way, but I\u0026rsquo;ve certainly seen sources further right make the \u0026ldquo;genuinely in favor of crime as a terminal value\u0026rdquo; argument. And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem too different from the leftist sources that say Republicans can\u0026rsquo;t really care about the lives of the unborn, they\u0026rsquo;re just \u0026ldquo;anti-woman\u0026rdquo; as a terminal value. Both proposals share this idea of not being able to understand that other people have different beliefs than you and that their actions proceed naturally from those beliefs. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,\u0026rdquo; they say \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.\u0026rdquo; [related: Ian Danskin | Always a Bigger Fish]\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chapman, David. 2016. “Developing Ethical, Social, and Cognitive Competence.” https://web.archive.org/web/20160618024656/https://meaningness.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/.

During this stage children are still developing their use of logical thinking. A child\u0026rsquo;s thinking is dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has \u0026ldquo;gone away\u0026rdquo; when it has in fact died, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore [see Freddish for a way of communicating with children which seeks to avoid such misunderstandings].

It didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to give me insight into my own life, help me understand my friends, or explain weird things about society.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve changed my mind about all of that after reading David Chapman\u0026rsquo;s Developing Ethical, Social, and Cognitive Competence.\n[Alexander\u0026rsquo;s link is dead, so I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced it with my own]\n   First, a refresher. Developmental psychology describes how children go from helpless infants to reasonable adults. Although a lot of it has to do with sensorimotor skills like walking and talking, the really interesting stuff is cognitive development. Children start off as very buggy reasoners incapable of all but the most superficial forms of logic but gradually go on to develop new abilities and insights that allow them to navigate adult life.\nMaybe the most famous of these is \u0026ldquo;theory of mind\u0026rdquo; [Theory of mind], the ability to view things from other people\u0026rsquo;s perspective. In a classic demonstration, researchers show little Amy a Skittles bag and ask what she thinks is inside.

Wikipedia gives the example of a child saying \u0026ldquo;I like Sesame Street, so Daddy must like Sesame Street too.\u0026rdquo; This is another theory of mind failure grounded in an inability to separate self and environment.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another example which tentatively sounds like a self-environment failure. Young children really don\u0026rsquo;t get foreign languages. I got a little of this teaching English in Japan, and heard more of it from other people. The really young kids treated English like a cipher; everybody started out knowing things' real (ie Japanese) names, but Americans insisted on converting them into their own special American-person code before talking about them. Kids would ask weird things like whether American parents would make an exception and speak Japanese to their kids who were too young to have learned English yet, or whether it was a zero-tolerance policy sort of thing and the families would just not communicate until the kids went to English school. And I made fun of them, but I also remember the first time I visited Paris I heard somebody talking to their dog, and for a split second I was like \u0026ldquo;Why would you expect your dog to know French?\u0026rdquo; before my brain kicked in and I was like \u0026ldquo;Duuhhhh….\u0026rdquo;\nThe infamous \u0026ldquo;magical thinking\u0026rdquo; [Magical thinking] which kids display until age 7 or so also involves confused self-environment boundaries. Maybe little Amy gets mad at Brayden and shouts \u0026ldquo;I HATE HIM\u0026rdquo; to her mother. The next day, Brayden falls off a step and skins his knee. Amy intuits a cause-and-effect relationship between her hatred and Brayden\u0026rsquo;s accident and feels guilty. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that her hatred is internal to herself and can\u0026rsquo;t affect the world directly. Or kids displaying animism at this age, and expecting that the TV doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because it\u0026rsquo;s angry, or the car\u0026rsquo;s not starting because it\u0026rsquo;s tired.\n Relevant: Child development stages.\n Psychology textbooks never discuss whether this progression in and out of developmental stages is innate or environmental, which is weird because psychology textbooks usually love that sort of thing. I always assumed it was innate, because it was on the same timeline as things like walking and talking which are definitely innate. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been moved to question that after reading some of the work comparing \u0026ldquo;primitive\u0026rdquo; cultures to primitive developmental stages.\nThis probably isn\u0026rsquo;t the most politically correct thing to do, but it\u0026rsquo;s notable enough that anthropologists have been thinking about it for centuries. For example, from Ethnicity, Nationality, and Religious Experience (a):\nPrimitive people are generally as intelligent as the people of any culture, including the contemporary industrial-electronic age cultures. that makes it all the more significant that their publicly shared cognitive style shows little identifiable formal operational thought. The probable explanation for this, if true, is simply that formal operational thought is more complexly difficult than earlier modes of thought and will be used in a culture in a publicly shared way only if that culture has developed techniques for training people in its use. Primitive cultures do not do that, and thus by default use easier styles of thought, ones closer in form to concrete oeprational and even pre-operational thought, as defined by Piaget.\n Primitive cultures certainly exhibit the magical thinking typical of young children; this is the origin of a whole host of superstitions and witch-doctory. They exhibit the same animism; there are hundreds of different animistic religions worldwide. And although I didn\u0026rsquo;t talk much about theories of moral development, primitive cultures' notion of taboo is pretty similar to Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s conventional stage.\nBut if different cultures progress through developmental milestones at different rates or not at all, then these aren\u0026rsquo;t universal laws of child development but facts about what skills get learned slowly or quickly in different cultures. In this model, development is not a matter of certain innate abilities like walking \u0026ldquo;unfolding\u0026rdquo; at the right time, but about difficult mental operations that you either learn or you don\u0026rsquo;t depending on how hard the world is trying to cram them into your head.\n This reads to me as supporting the idea that Culture is the secret of humanity\u0026rsquo;s success. Cultures don\u0026rsquo;t all have the same zeitgeist, etc. Culturally-driven adaptations, lessons, etc, will be absent or less pronounced in individuals who grew up in cultures which lack them.\n I remember reading this piece by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse war-violence-glorifying film \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo;:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper.

Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,\u0026rdquo; they say \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.\u0026rdquo;\n(compare: \u0026ldquo;Brayden brought the Skittles bag with him for lunch, so he must enjoy eating pennies.\u0026rdquo; Or: \u0026ldquo;Daddy is refusing to watch Sesame Street with me, so he must be secretly watching it with someone else he likes better instead.\u0026quot;)\n[Broken links replaced]\n Related to this idea: Ian Danskin | Always a Bigger Fish.

For this purpose, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to be right about everything. In fact, we expect most readers to buy only about 70 percent of what we\u0026rsquo;re selling\u0026mdash; and we\u0026rsquo;re OK with that.\n In some sense, I agree with the thesis, and in another sense I disagree, and overall I gravitate towards this second sense, but after having read the review you may think that I actually gravitate more towards the first one. It can be both things, depending on how one weighs the different agreements and disagreements. I am weighing heavily the core claims and discounting many object level claims. I am also putting some weight behind conceptual clarity and discussion of possible alternative explanations (Side effects of reading too much philosophy!). This last thing does not make me disagree per se, but makes me reduce the strenght of my agreement with a given claim.\nBy where is this disagreement? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that education is -to a large degree - about signaling [Signaling]? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that politics is not just about making policy? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that charity is not just about helping others in the most efficient way? Yes, those things are true, but that\u0026rsquo;s not my point. The object-level claims of the book, the claims about how things are are largely correct. It is the interpretation I take issue with.\n   What is exactly the elephant in the brain?\nThe authors (Simler and Hanson, henceforth SH) say: selfishness, the selfish parts of us. But not quite, they say shortly after. The elephant in the brain is also competition for status, power, and sex, and also misdirection, lies, and self-delusion.\nThese are, note, different things. One can be acting for selfish purposes deliberately instead of \u0026ldquo;unconsciously\u0026rdquo;, for example. Indeed, most of the things we do are done selfishly, for our own goals and purposes. We perhaps don\u0026rsquo;t think about it, but we don\u0026rsquo;t think that we are constantly breathing either, yet we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that we are deluded about breathing.\nThings we do that are not selfish are rare and few: From helping strangers, to donating to charity, to just being nice to people, but note that in some of these there can even be a selfish component to altruistic actions, and it can even be the case that this selfish component can be arranged to serve a non-selfish end, as we will see with the discussion on Effective Altruism.\n Education  The idea here is that the way education works is not so much oriented towards teaching (building up human capital), but towards credentialing: each student has a somewhat fixed ability level (i.e. intelligence, conscientiousness, etc), and being able to go through university certifies that you do have those skills. IQ tests alone wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do, because the sought traits are not just intelligence. Going through 3-5 years of university maintaining consistent high scores not only says you are smart, but that you are willing to devote those smarts to a task, for years, dealing with both subjects you will like and subjects that you will not like: Education doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you a better worker, it reveals how much of a good worker you are [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y]. (Well, it will help somewhat, but you get the idea).\n[\u0026hellip;]\nStudents are happy when classes are canceled because they think classes are inefficient and thus can be compressed. Students at school are there to pass the exams, get high grades, go to uni and get a job, ask any. There is a time T to teach all the material, and if you think, as a student, the efficient time is smaller than T [There\u0026rsquo;s no speed limit], as it was the case when I was at school, then you would be happy if classes are cancelled: it just means you will get more condensed classes afterwards. Exam and learning-wise it is the same, plus you get free time.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nUltimately, we might have these things - I\u0026rsquo;m speculating here, by own admission- because of the aristocratic and then religious origins of modern education. In the past, if you wanted to become a blacksmith, you just learned from your father or became an apprentice at the local guild. Aristocrats had to learn their signaling subjects. Men of religion had to learn grammar, and logic, rhetoric, and latin to engage in theology. When education was then extended to the masses, elites wanted them to have proper values and morals, etc. People might also have been looking upwards at what the elites were doing, and seeing those things as being high status, they became engrained into what education was becoming. Fast forward to the present and we still have some of that present. (This could also be tied with the propaganda explanation)\nAbout students who study the \u0026ldquo;useless\u0026rdquo; subjects like liberal arts mentioned is because, as anyone who has access to Google would know, those subjects get you consumption benefits (People like studying them), and they also get you access to jobs. Are students deluded about the purposes of their education? Not at all! They can honestly think that they study what they like, and that they also gain skills somewhat related to their future employment. A story like \u0026ldquo;I like History so I study it, plus learning History will help me gain a broad understanding of human nature, writing, critical analysis, etc, and this is useful for management or whatever\u0026rdquo; sounds like a plausible reason a History student would give.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo here is the thing: I have agreed with the signaling theory of how education works. I have agreed with the object level claims that education is inefficient, that students forget about what they learn, that much of what schools teach is useless for getting a job and so forth. My disagreement is in the why. We observe and agree about the reality of the same phenomena, but we disagree about the underlying, hard to observe (We would have to engage in some surveying and historical analysis) causes of what we see.\n Confused concepts  I\u0026rsquo;m not going to review every single chapter at length, but I\u0026rsquo;ll make in this section a series of remarks about the underlying theory.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTake sex. What is sex about? Why do people engage in sex with protection? It is pleasurable. That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t find this statement controversial: It is the answer most people would give, and if you poked their brains hard enough.\nIt would be odd to see someone saying: No, that\u0026rsquo;s not the real reason: the real reason is reproduction, or bonding, or something, people are hypocrites about why they have sex.\nThis confused use of concepts applies to many of these hidden motives: and it is the basic misunderstanding first year students of evolutionary psychology are taught to avoid: There are ultimate [Ultimate cause] and proximate [Proximate cause] explanations for behaviours. Reproduction may be the ultimate reason why we happen to find sex pleasurable. But pleasure itself and alone is in most cases why people have sex while going to great lengths to avoid conceptions.\nSimilarly, for selfishness, take the case of a parent who does X for her child out of altruism. Again, something saying: \u0026ldquo;it is actually selfishness, X helps propagate certain genes that reward X\u0026rdquo; would be mistaken in their assessment of X as selfish in the standard meaning of selfishness, even if that were correct from a gene-centric perspective.\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 3.10 6 165.72 2023-09-21T08:30:52Z    How the aristocratic and religious origin of education may have influenced subject matter\nBack  In the past, if you wanted to become a blacksmith, you just learned from your father or became an apprentice at the local guild.

The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.\n(Tolkien 1994)\n   Imagine a story. This story has a hero. By the end of the tale, the hero has done many great deeds. He (or she) has vanquished some terrific evil, journeyed to some distant place, or protected the innocent multitudes from a cruel fate they did not deserve. In a past age, accomplishing feats such as these was enough to earn the title \u0026lsquo;hero.\u0026rsquo; But this hero comes from a different time. His heroism is not found in the number of enemies he slew, in the distance he traveled, or in the acclaim of his adoring crowds. His heroism is rooted in his character. The relevant aspects of his character are apparent only to his closest friends. Occasionally even they are not privy to the source of his glory, which the audience only learns of because they have privileged access to the hero\u0026rsquo;s internal thoughts. His heroism is grounded in a firm conviction: he does not want to be a hero.\nThe hero wants not fame, nor fortune; he is not motivated by power, nor by revenge. He performs his heroics out of necessity, out of duty, or out of the simple fact that he is the only one on the scene. The hero would rather not be out slaying dragons. He earnestly wishes for a normal life. He yearns for a peaceful and settled world where he is not the chosen one. But it is precisely because our hero lacks ambition that he can be trusted. In a world where men ache for power, we cheer for the protagonist who emphatically rejects it. From beginning to end, our hero\u0026rsquo;s defining trait is a desire not to be a hero. Some are born great, others achieve greatness\u0026mdash;but we love best those blessed few who have had greatness thrust upon them.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ve sketched out an archetypal template. This is the template upon which the vast majority our era\u0026rsquo;s hero-tales are crafted. This is the story of Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, Luke Skywalker, and Jack Ryan. It is Captain America and Spiderman. It is the central trope of science fiction, fantasy, international thrillers, super hero stories, and their \u0026ldquo;YA literature\u0026rdquo; counterparts. It is the myth that drives the imaginations of our times (a).\nFor all of this we have John Ronald Reuel Tolkien to thank. I am sympathetic to the argument that Tolkien is the seminal Anglophone author of the 20th century. Perhaps his literary craft is deft enough to deserves that title. Perhaps it is not. Either way I wager that in a few centuries time when our descendants' literary memory has collapsed our age down to one author (as we have done with the ages of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton), Tolkien will be the man remembered. This is not just because Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s works have been fantastically popular, even decades after its first publication, and in cultural milieus quite divorced from its creation. Nor it is because in Tolkien we find the genesis of so many of our era\u0026rsquo;s most popular genres (fantasy, science fiction, role playing games, and so forth). Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s influence is both subtler and more fundamental than this. Tolkien redefined the way popular literature treats many of its most common themes. This post looks at only one of those themes, but I am comfortable with the contention that Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work embodies an entire era\u0026rsquo;s way of understanding the world. It is hard to say if Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Lord of the Rings (a) actually created the central cultural currents of our age or if it is simply their most prominent and enduring incarnation. Either way, Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work is here to stay.\nReaders familiar with Lord of the Rings will immediately see the connections between my opening sketch and the tale of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s ring-bearer. I am not going to devote an entire essay to this topic\u0026mdash;a great deal has already been written about Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s conception of good and evil, power, corruption, innocence, and heroism, and I see no reason to repeat others' feats here\u0026mdash;but I will emphasize two points that deserve strong restatement.\nThe first point: An aversion to glory is not just the defining character trait of the novel\u0026rsquo;s central hero. The distinction between greatness and power as goods to be strived for versus greatness and power as burdens to be carried is the distinction that sets apart almost of all of the novel\u0026rsquo;s protagonists from their foils. It is the defining difference between Frodo and Smeagol, Faramir and Boromir, Aragorn and Denethor, and Gandalf and Saruman. The second trait saves Galadriel in exile; the first corrupts Sauron anew after his master\u0026rsquo;s defeat. If one is allowed to describe objects as foils, this same distinction sets Sauron\u0026rsquo;s rings, key to his strategy for corrupting Middle Earth, as a foil to the methods of the \u0026lsquo;wizards\u0026rsquo; sent from Western lands to save Middle Earth.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Greer, Tanner. 2019. “On The Tolkienic Hero.” The Scholar’s Stage. https://scholars-stage.org/on-the-tolkienic-hero/.

True! In 1950, the American Political Science Association \u0026ldquo;released a call to arms\u0026hellip;pleading for a more polarized political system\u0026rdquo;. The report argued that \u0026ldquo;the parties contain too much diversity of opinion and work together too easily, leaving voters confused about who to vote for and why\u0026rdquo;. Everyone agreed with each other so much, and compromised so readily, that supporting one party over the other seemed almost pointless.\nIn 1976, three years after Roe v. Wade, Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to support abortion restrictions. That same year, a poll found that \u0026ldquo;only 54% of the electorate believed that the Republican Party was more conservative than the Democratic Party\u0026rdquo;; 30% thought there was no difference. As late as 2004 (a), about equal numbers (within 5 pp) of Democrats and Republicans agreed with statements like \u0026ldquo;government is almost always wasteful and inefficient\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;immigrants are a burden on our country\u0026rdquo;. Between the late 60s and early 90s, Democratic presidents deregulated the airlines and passed welfare reform; Republican presidents pushed immigration amnesties and founded the EPA.\nWhat happened between then and now? Klein has two answers: a historical answer, and a structural answer.\nThe historical answer is: the Dixiecrats switched from Democrat to Republican.\nWhen the North won the Civil War, it had grand plans to remake the South into a paradise of racial equality and universal love. After Lincoln\u0026rsquo;s death, his successor Andrew Johnson decided this sounded hard and gave up. Within a few decades, the South was back to being a racist, paramilitary-violence-prone one-party dictatorship. That one party called itself \u0026ldquo;Democrat\u0026rdquo;, but had few similiarites to the Democrats in the North. The Southern Democrats (\u0026ldquo;Dixiecrats\u0026rdquo;) and northern Democrats disagreed on lots of issues, but the South hated the Republicans so much after their experience with Lincoln that they caucused with the northern Democrats anyway. This turned into a stable coalition, with northern Democrats agreeing to support the South against civil rights for blacks, and the Dixiecrats supporting the northern Democrats whenever they needed something.\nBut since the Democratic party contained both northern Democrats (relatively liberal) and Dixiecrats (relatively conservative), it didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take a coherent party-wide stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. And by the median voter theorem, that meant the Republicans also didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take a coherent stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. So both parties ended out centrist and identical.\nIn 1964, the Civil Rights Act threatened the Dixiecrats' key issue. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite as simple as \u0026ldquo;Democrats were for it, Republicans were against it\u0026rdquo; - in fact, 80% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats supported it. But that year\u0026rsquo;s presidential election pitted heavily pro-CRA Democrat Lyndon Johnson against anti-CRA Republican Barry Goldwater, beginning Southerners' defection to the Republican Party.\nKlein says this successfully got all the conservatives on one side of the aisle and all the liberals on the other, allowing polarization to begin. Essentially, he believes polarization is a natural process, which the odd coalitions of the early 20th century temporarily prevented. Once the coalitions were broken, it could begin to do its work. He spends the rest of the book talking about why exactly polarization is so natural, what aspects of modernization have made it worse, and what sort of feedback loops make it keep going.\n   Aligned identities don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make people more loyal to their own party; in fact, people are generally less pro-their-own-party than before. In the 1960s, 80% of people were in a political party; nowadays only 63% are. In the 80s, people\u0026rsquo;s average favorability rating for their own party was 72 on a 100 point scale; today it\u0026rsquo;s only 63. So it\u0026rsquo;s not the average voter has suddenly realized their party is great and super-important to them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s that they really, really hate the other guys.\nThis is called negative partisanship [Negative partisanship], and apparently it\u0026rsquo;s the driver of our entire political system.\n   Klein argues that although polarization has affected both sides, the Democrats have managed to muddle on, but the Republicans have gone completely off the rails.\nStop for a second before reacting here. I get the impression that Klein understands he is taking a risk (not an actual risk of decreased popularity, given the givens, but some kind of metaphysical risk to his soul) by abandoning his previous attempt at a neutral stance and coming out like this. I think he feels bad about it, and that he considered not writing this chapter on that basis. I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important to him that we consider the possibility that he wants to be neutral, is trying as hard as he can to be neutral, but that even from an attempted-neutral point of view he thinks the decline of the Republican Party is a threat to the stability of the country. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important that we maintain a stance where we recognize this is a potentially true state of affairs - it really is possible that one party is much worse than the other! - and don\u0026rsquo;t automatically condemn Klein for raising the possibility.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut after a bit of this he regains his footing and segues into a stronger argument that might give even conservatives some food for thought. Klein notes that although both Democrats and Republicans have some extremists in their coalition, the institutional Democrats seem to be doing a better job preventing them from gaining power. In a purely structural sense, without getting into whether you believe they\u0026rsquo;re morally equivalent or whatever, the democratic socialists/Bernie Sanders seem to be an \u0026ldquo;insurrection\u0026rdquo; comparable to the Tea Party/Trump on the Republican side. But the mainstream neoliberal Republicans surrendered to the Tea Party and to Trump in rapid succession, and the mainstream neoliberal Democrats are still resisting. The Democrats' Tea Party equivalent is probably AOC, but she and her allies are still a small minority in the Democratic caucus. And the Dem presidential nomination went to Joe Biden, a moderate who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t look out of place running for president in 1988 (in fact\u0026hellip;). Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized was published too early to mention Biden in this context, but we can count him as a correct prediction for its theory.\nKlein calls this \u0026ldquo;the Democratic party more successfully resisting polarization\u0026rdquo;, and thinks of this as related to structural differences between the two parties. He says that the Republican Party represents the modal American on various characteristics, eg Christian (the most common religion), white (the most common race), straight (the most common sexual orientation), etc, whereas the Democrats represent everyone else (eg Muslims, Jews, atheists, and every minority religion; blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and every minority race; etc). That means the Republicans are more ideologically uniform - Christians are genuinely similar to other Christians, but Jews are only superficially similar to Muslims by virtue of their non-Christianness. That means ideology can\u0026rsquo;t really capture the Democratic Party in the same way it captures the Republican Party. One point kind of in support of this - ask Democrats their favorite news source, and you get a long tail of stuff (most popular is CNN at 15%, then NPR at 13%, and so on). But ask conservatives and it\u0026rsquo;s dominated by FOX (47%). Does this lack of news-source diversity reflect a lack of ideological diversity? Could be.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nKlein understands he\u0026rsquo;s supposed to end the book with a collection of suggestions for how to be less polarized. He is not sure he wants to do this. Nonpolarization rested on a gentleman\u0026rsquo;s agreement to continue racism, which was bad. Voters benefit from having two clear alternatives to choose from. We Should Not Take A Rosy-Eyed View Of An Idealized Past. Plus he isn\u0026rsquo;t sure we could end polarization even if we wanted to.\nBut he suggests we also do some things to make sure polarization doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause national collapse or a civil war or something. He suggests fixing the Supreme Court (eg having more justices, with fixed-year terms) so that there aren\u0026rsquo;t constant crises about who gets to pick the swing vote. He wants to do something about the debt ceiling and other \u0026ldquo;ticking time bombs\u0026rdquo; where if the parties don\u0026rsquo;t agree, it causes some kind of disaster. And he suggests granting statehood to Puerto Rico and DC, because the better the electoral calculus is for the Democrats, the more the Republicans will have to change their strategy, and maybe their new strategy won\u0026rsquo;t involve them being evil racists, and then the Democrats won\u0026rsquo;t have to be so justly and correctly polarized against them (am I being unfair? check page 257 and see for yourself).\nFinally, he suggests some increased individual reflectivity and thoughtfulness on our own parts. If all of us just do a tiny bit each day to fight the polarization within ourselves, together we can form a growing tide of compassion and mutual understanding. Haha, yeah right.\n   This hit basically the notes a book like this should hit, but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel too much more enlightened about Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2021. “Book Review: Why We’re Polarized.” Substack Newsletter.

As an example: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the effect size of removing history from the curriculum and leaving more time for the kids to play?\u0026rdquo; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to remove history but that idea, \u0026ldquo;What are the opportunity costs of our curriculum\u0026rdquo;, are valuable.  Notes Why would mastery learning work? Some proposed experiments  Suppose that something by the name \u0026ldquo;The Incredible Learning Method\u0026rdquo; or TILM has been shown to increase performance by d=0.5. One then wonders what TILM is. TILM consists on doing spaced repetition and doing pushups every day.\nShould we then recommend that kids do pushups if they want to learn? Or should we find what, ultimately, causes TILM to work?\nIn this approach, we break down a method into its components and experiment with them separately, or together by parts, seeing what effects we find. Then, we could try to study how each of the subcomponents behaves in other samples, or try to find neuroscience-level explanations for them.\nFor spaced repetition, the answer here would be the underlying idea of there being a forgetting curve (a) which in turn might be possible to explain by some feature of how the brain works at a low level.\nIn fact, could it be that mastery learning is spaced repetition in disguise?\nOr, it could also be that the thing doing the trick is just more time: If we assume that the more exposed one is to a concept more one learns it (with perhaps some plateau at the end), then the fact that a student keeps studying over and over the same material would increase performance. If so, mastery learning wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have an effect if one controls for time invested in instruction. As Slavin puts it:\nIn an extreme form, the central contentions of mastery learning theory are almost tautologically true. If we establish a reasonable set of learning objectives and demand that every student achieve them at a high level regardless of how long that takes, then it is virtually certain that all students will ultimately achieve that criterion.\n Or, it could also be that it is just the testing that is doing the work. Recall, mastery learning is a study-test-feedback-corrective loop. Slavin found that the study-test-feedback loop works almost as well. But we also know that study-test also works! This is known as the testing effect (a).\nOr, it could also be that mastering lesson N does have an impact on better absorbing the knowledge in lessons N+i. If so, a way to study this would be teaching a group with mastery learning and another with regular methods one lesson, then teaching both groups with regular methods lesson 2. If mastery learning works, then the group of students that originally was taught with mastery learning should get better results. This is, it seems to me, the only genuine \u0026ldquo;mastery\u0026rdquo; effect.\n Conclusion  Bloom noted that mastery learning had an effect size of around 1 (one sigma); while tutoring leads to d=2. This is mostly an outlier case.\nNonetheless, Bloom was on to something: Tutoring and mastery learning do have a degree of experimental support, and fortunately it seems that carefully designed software systems can completely replace the instructional side of traditional teaching, achieving better results, on par with one to one tutoring. However, designing them is a hard endeavour, and there is a motivational component of teachers that may not be as easily replicable purely by software.\nOverall, it\u0026rsquo;s good news that the effects are present for younger and older students, and across subjects, but the effect sizes of tutoring, mastery learning or DI are not as good as they would seem from Bloom\u0026rsquo;s paper. That said, it is true that tutoring does have large effect sizes, and that properly designed software does as well. The DARPA case study shows what is possible with software tutoring, in the case the effect sizes went even beyond Bloom\u0026rsquo;s paper.\n[\u0026hellip;] Mastery learning, it seems, works by overfitting to a test, and the chances that those skills do not generalise are nontrivial.\n Coda: What should you learn  I have been discussing above learning methods. But what about learning content? What should one learn? Bryan Caplan, in his book The Case Against Education10 argues that skills are not very transferable: you get good at what you do, and you quickly forget everything else. This informed my priors when looking at the mastery learning literature; and so I was not that surprised to find the issue with the kinds of tests I outlined in my section on Slavin.\nCaplan is right, and this opens an avenue to improve teaching: Suppose you focus on the very basics that will most likely be useful to the students in the future (reading, writing, mathematics). With the time freed up from not teaching other subjects, one can both help disadvantaged students get good at those core topics, and let non-disadvantaged students use the extra time to learn about whatever they want. I would even suggest let them go home, but it may be argued one of the implicit roles of school is that of a place to keep the kids while the parents are working, a kindergarten for older children, but if parents are okay letting their kids roam around, and cities are safe, this is not an issue. Definitely worth exploring.\nGranting that one can use DI to hammer down very basic points, should one also hammer down History and English Literature? Just because you can make the learning of those happen doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should: the effectiveness of an intervention also depends on the values being used to judge it.

Schwarzenegger had a plan in place to address pandemics like the current one, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a plan, the equipment required was actually manufactured and subsequently purchased.\nThe state, flush with tax revenue (a), soon sunk more than $200 million into the mobile hospital program and a related Health Surge Capacity Initiative to stockpile medicines and medical gear for use in outbreaks of infectious disease, according to former emergency management officials and state budget records.\n But then\nBut the ambitious effort, which would have been vital as the state confronts the new coronavirus today, hit a wall: a brutal recession, a free fall in state revenues \u0026ndash; and in 2011, the administration of a fiscally minded Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, who came into office facing a $26 billion deficit.\nAnd so, that year, the state cut off the money to store and maintain the stockpile of supplies and the mobile hospitals. The hospitals were defunded before they\u0026rsquo;d ever been used.\nMuch of the medical equipment \u0026ndash; including the ventilators, critical life-saving tools that are in short supply in the current pandemic \u0026ndash; was given to local hospitals and health agencies, former health officials said. But the equipment was donated without any funding to maintain them. The respirators were allowed to expire without being replaced.\n Now one may wonder what can be done to avoid this entire class of mistakes. Sure enough, becoming a prepper society is not the most efficient thing there is, but if you are going to predictably have impredictable shocks (As to the when and what exactly) that affect everyone, you probably need those emergency plans. So the working assumption should be that there will be a next global pandemic for sure, what is unknown is what virus and where it will come from, but it will come. There will be plenty of time to plan and build and prepare, but those preparations have to be maintained over time.\n Death by friction  Finance is another of the topics touched on by the article; the fact that the US government can be paid by everyone but not easily pay everyone probably shares something with the US tax hell; in at least the UK there is no need to think about taxes for most people the government knows everything they need to know about you anyway so they are paid for you. In the US it is the same case - that\u0026rsquo;s why tax fraud is a thing, they are double checking your work for no good reason. In the UK I was once taxed in excess. As the meme goes, you won\u0026rsquo;t believe what happened next; I just had to log-in in a -nicely- designed website, write my bank account details in a box and two days later I was refunded. Just like that. No need for complex forms, any paperwork, phone calls, or anything of the sort.\n Skyscrapers, fast and slow  You don\u0026rsquo;t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.\nYou see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u0026rsquo;t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can\u0026rsquo;t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Westworld\u0026rdquo; wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn\u0026rsquo;t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\n(Andreessen 2020)\n I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it is smug complacency. There is some complacency, to be sure, though I don\u0026rsquo;t know how smug it is. There is no demand for smartphones unless Apple shows up; or there is no demand for fast email apps until Superhuman shows up. Once you see 90 Hz refresh rates on screens you didn\u0026rsquo;t know you wanted it. There is no demand for the future until the future is here.\nIn housing it\u0026rsquo;s not complacency either. Take San Francisco. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t San Francisco outcompeting Singapore at skypscraper building? It\u0026rsquo;s illegal to build. Okay, but why? After all San franciscoans do want more housing, it\u0026rsquo;s not just the tech bros who rant on twitter about it. Once it is possible to build those gleaming skyscrapers, the US does not do bad compared to other countries, the need for national flagellation here is rather moderate. So here it\u0026rsquo;s not that the real state developers are lazy and complacent, it\u0026rsquo;s that the political structures of, in this case, San Francisco, are captured by a politically organized minority who does not want density and skyscrapers. That\u0026rsquo;s not a problem of not building, but of not allowing building in the first place: politics and regulation. [\u0026hellip;]\nAt first a reaction I can imagine to the piece may be that focus on skyscrapers may be misguided; while they have some intrinsic appeal as unique works of art - a reason skyscrapers are so expensive is that each one tends to be an artisanal, one of a kind piece, not a mass-market product - they are demanded because they enable economies of scale in cities but in turn those exist because we are not pushing hard enough for remote work. The right ideal would thus be not skyscrapers but nice walkable cities and work from home, which while they appeal less to the futuristically inclined, is what people actually would prefer. However that critique would be misplaced: With skyscrapers and faster transportation, life in the city becomes compatible with life in a spacious house with an ample garden, so you can fluidly decide where you want to live.\n Education  You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing education research that\u0026rsquo;s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven\u0026rsquo;t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?\n(Andreessen 2020)\n One answer to why not do all the things we have learned is because very little works. I wrote a longer research essay on Bloom\u0026rsquo;s two sigma (a) [Jose Luis Ricon | On Bloom\u0026rsquo;s Two Sigma Problem] and education research in general and the conclusion one gets from it is that researching better ways to learn is hard. Bloom\u0026rsquo;s two sigma is more like Bloom\u0026rsquo;s one sigma, at best, though there is promise in software-based methods to complement or even replace teachers. It remains a puzzle why large public education systems have not deployed these systems at scale; for them developing software tutoring is a one-off cost - the content of what is taught changes very little -, so presumably this may have to do with either lack of knowledge that these systems are possible, or opposition from within the system itself (again, politics).\nThe emphasis on more universities is also misplaced; those top end universities are to a large extent accreditation systems (a) [Jose Luis Ricon | Notes on The Case Against Education] for those already skilled. Sure you can scale up Harvard to educate 1000x more people but I doubt that will yield anywhere near 1000x more patents, companies, or research coming out of the expanded set of alumni.\n The P-word  I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u0026rsquo;s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There\u0026rsquo;s an excellent chance I\u0026rsquo;ll agree with you.\n While I don\u0026rsquo;t intend this to be a critique of Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s essay; in fact I agree with its spirit; I think the more interesting question is Why aren\u0026rsquo;t thing being built? Why aren\u0026rsquo;t things being built faster than they are? What are the mechanistic forces at play in each sector?. My thesis is that the mentality of improvement - to put it in Anton Howes (a)' terms- has not been lost; rather the frictions in going from zero to curing cancer have increased.\nBut what should be built. Look at any organization that has been around for a long time. Is it a law of nature that, as they age, organizations degrade in function and stop making the most efficient use of resources, making their replacement a necessity4 (a)? Take the entire world\u0026rsquo;s space launch sector. For decades we launched rockets and threw them away; sure there were proof of concepts (a) that showed that avoiding this engineering form of economic masochism was achievable but the idea of reusing rockets didn\u0026rsquo;t really became a thing until SpaceX (a) came in.\n What better regulation could look like  [\u0026hellip;] imagine if you had, in the US, FDA competitors (regulated by a Meta-FDA); one could for example scrap the Phase I/II/III trial system and have relaxed requirements on a case-by-case basis. Any proposal on accelerating drug-to-market could be tried. One would have to design the meta-regulations carefully so as to line up incentives to balance safety and innovation [\u0026hellip;]\n Sounds like an adversarial relationship like a Generative adversarial network.\nFlashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Andreessen, Marc. 2020. “It’s Time to Build.” Andreessen Horowitz. https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/.

Doint so requires a certain amount of power consolidation since spreading power too thin leads to the vetocracy discussed below. I also agree that people don\u0026rsquo;t like this sort of work \u0026ndash; what Klein calls \u0026ldquo;[Meta]-building\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions\u0026rdquo;.\nNotes  I think Andreessen is uncharacteristically underestimating the appetite for building. The absence of creation doesn\u0026rsquo;t reflect an absence of desire \u0026mdash; even in that epicenter of supposed stagnation, Washington, DC.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve covered Congress for almost 20 years. The place is littered with proposals to construct universal pre-K (a) and reimagine the health system (a), to decarbonize the US economy (a) and incentivize drug development through prizes (a) and solve the housing crisis (a). They just don\u0026rsquo;t pass. It\u0026rsquo;s become a running joke (a) in Washington that every week is \u0026ldquo;infrastructure week.\u0026rdquo; But we\u0026rsquo;re not rebuilding American infrastructure.\nThe question, then, is why don\u0026rsquo;t we build? What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my answer: The institutions through which Americans build have become biased against action rather than toward it. They\u0026rsquo;ve become, in political scientist Francis Fukuyama\u0026rsquo;s term (a), \u0026ldquo;vetocracies,\u0026rdquo; in which too many actors have veto rights over what gets built. That\u0026rsquo;s true in the federal government. It\u0026rsquo;s true in state and local governments. It\u0026rsquo;s even true in the private sector.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not against soliciting more ideas of what to build. But what we need is sustained funding, focus, and organizing to make building in America possible again. And that requires patiently engaging with the kinds of institutions that frustrate builders.\n The federal vetocracy  That the US government has become a dysfunctional vetocracy is obvious. Hell, I wrote a whole book (a) [Ezra Klein | Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized] about it. But in short: America\u0026rsquo;s system of checks and balances requires unusual and even extraordinary levels of consensus to pass legislation. First, you need the agreement of the House, the Senate, the White House, and, increasingly, the Supreme Court.\nMore granularly, congressional power is diffused across committees. The Senate has built in a supermajority requirement, known as the filibuster, which effectively raises the threshold for passage from 51 votes to 60 votes.\nThis raises the question: If the problem is embedded in the structure of the US government, how did the US ever do anything big? The short answer is that for most of our political history, two unusual conditions held. First, the parties were ideologically mixed, which made compromise easier. Second, one party was usually electorally dominant (a), which gave the party in the minority a reason to compromise: If you can\u0026rsquo;t win, you may as well deal.\nBoth those conditions have dissolved. America\u0026rsquo;s political parties are more ideologically \u0026mdash; and demographically \u0026mdash; polarized than ever before. We\u0026rsquo;re also in the most competitive period American politics has ever seen. In a system like that, both sides utilize the system\u0026rsquo;s bias toward inaction to foil their opponents. You can see this in the rise of the filibuster over time. The rule has been around almost as long as America, but it\u0026rsquo;s only been deployed as an omnipresent veto in recent decades:\nThe result is a system biased toward inaction. The left can\u0026rsquo;t remake American health care. The right can\u0026rsquo;t voucherize American schools. The left can\u0026rsquo;t pass a climate bill. The right can\u0026rsquo;t privatize Social Security. Neither side can rewrite our immigration laws, hence the turn towards oscillating executive orders. Neither side can pass their infrastructure packages. Neither side can reform social insurance.\nIn the midst of a pandemic, a financial crisis, or a terrorist attack, emergency measures can pass, for a little while, but absent some kind of crisis, paralysis is the rule. (This is a sketch, and it ignores some important party asymmetries, so read the book (a) if you want to dig deeper into how polarization makes American ungovernable.)\n The state and local vetocracy  If paralysis ended once you walked out of the Capitol, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a housing crisis. We\u0026rsquo;d have better social insurance infrastructure. We\u0026rsquo;d have better infrastructure, period. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMarc Dunkelman spent years cataloging (a) the many failures to revamp Penn Station, a number of which came complete with hefty doses of federal funding. Each time, the story was the same: Plenty of people who wanted to build, and plenty of money with which to build, but too many people with vetoes who simply didn\u0026rsquo;t want the building to happen.\nThis is representative democracy at its worst: A democracy that only represents those who know to show up at meetings most people never hear about, and so ends up handing power to special interests and aggrieved NIMBYs. I highly recommend this Weeds podcast (a) on \u0026ldquo;neighborhood defenders\u0026rdquo; and the way participatory local processes favor the status quo for more on that dynamic.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs Dunkelman puts it, \u0026ldquo;in New York, and in other cities, government power is now spread so thin that places once incapable of stopping bad projects now cannot get good projects off the ground.\u0026rdquo; That applies far more broadly, of course, than just city governance.\n The capitalist vetocracy  But some of Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s examples really can\u0026rsquo;t be blamed on the government, at least not in a traditional sense.\nAmerica doesn\u0026rsquo;t have more ICU beds because hospitals have budgets to balance. You can\u0026rsquo;t both run a profitable hospital and maintain enough spare capacity for a once-in-a-century pandemic.\nSimilarly, the companies that make ventilators are private companies. They didn\u0026rsquo;t make more ventilators because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t demand for more ventilators. Same goes for surgical masks, eye shields, hospital gowns. Now, you can argue the government should\u0026rsquo;ve been stockpiling more of this stuff all along \u0026mdash; and definitely should have been ramping up production in January and February \u0026mdash; but a capitalist logic of efficiency prevails both inside and outside the market.\nTake, for instance, the wildly successful Obama administration program to loan money to renewable energy companies that became infamous because one of those companies, Solyndra, was a bust. That program led to a slew of successes (a) (including Tesla (a)) and turned a profit (a) to taxpayers. As Michael Lewis argues at length in his book The Fifth Risk (a), the problem, if anything, was that it was too cautious \u0026mdash; so afraid of a Solyndra-like story that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t funding sufficiently risky investments. But they proved right to be afraid.\nIf even the government is forced to turn a constant profit on its programs and to avoid anything that might look like a boondoggle, you can imagine the pressure actual private companies are under. CEOs of all kinds of companies lament \u0026ldquo;short-termism (a).\u0026rdquo; Startup theorist Eric Ries has even gotten SEC approval for a \u0026ldquo;long-term stock exchange (a)\u0026rdquo; meant to ease the problem.\nIn practice, short-term shareholder capitalism acts as a kind of vetocracy on public companies: If the market thinks whatever you\u0026rsquo;re doing is going to cut quarterly earning for an uncertain payoff, it can punish you severely, and instantly, for trying. There are CEOs like Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Jeff Bezos who\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get themselves a longer leash, but they\u0026rsquo;re the exceptions that infuriate the rules.\n We need to rebuild institutions  I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;ll be enough. So let me end with my answer to Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s question: What should we build? We should build institutions biased toward action [Bias toward action] and ambition, rather than inaction and incrementalism.\nBut that means doing the difficult work of reforming existing institutions that aren\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere. You can\u0026rsquo;t sidestep the existence of the government, as too many in Silicon Valley want to do. You have to engage with it. You have to muster the political power to rebuild parts of it. And then you need to use the government to make markets competitive again.\nAt the federal level, I\u0026rsquo;d get rid of the filibuster, simplify the committee system, democratize elections, and make sure majorities could implement their agendas once elected. As I\u0026rsquo;ve argued for years, we should prefer the problems of a system where elected majorities can fulfill the promises that got them elected to one where elected majorities cannot deliver on the promises that the American people voted for. The latter system, which is the one Americans live in now, drives frustration and dysfunction.\nBut legislators on both sides prefer the status quo because it gives them power when they\u0026rsquo;re in the minority, and because they\u0026rsquo;re more afraid of what their opponents might do than committed to what they\u0026rsquo;ve promised to do. The allure of what they could build isn\u0026rsquo;t as powerful as the fear of what the other side may build.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll let others make granular recommendations at the state, local, and market levels. But whatever the recommendations, the same thing is needed: A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions. [Meta]-building isn\u0026rsquo;t a popular pastime, and the patient, focused work it requires is particularly frustrating, in my experience, to entrepreneurial personalities.\n Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 6 140.97 2023-08-15T16:31:10Z    Ezra Klein proposes that we don\u0026rsquo;t build because {{key American systems bias toward inaction}@0}.\nSource (Klein 2020)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Klein, Ezra. 2020. “Why We Can’t Build.” Vox. https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21228469/marc-andreessen-build-government-coronavirus.

When we look around us, we see a world littered with the physical and institutional detritus of past failures\u0026mdash;with depressingly little to show for any recent action, whatsoever. Political and legal sclerosis grip our governing bodies from the national legislature to city governments, and they smother our ability to build anything at all. The only choice we seem able to make anymore is the choice not to make anything. The American built environment has ossified, preserving our stagnation in amber; those looking to the future now look elsewhere\u0026mdash;to science fiction and fantasy, perhaps. It is undeniable that we are undergoing a crisis of will\u0026mdash;and that nearly everything around us in America cuts against the impulse to build a future. But is there really capability to do so, strangled by our current system, waiting to be unshackled? And must we somehow transcend politics to unleash it?\nIf we want to succeed in rebuilding the nation, we will need not just the destruction of existing barriers but the construction of positive political goals. In this light, Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s answer to the question of politics is quite strange. What does it mean to \u0026ldquo;separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics\u0026rdquo;? One can imagine Bay Area tech entrepreneurs nodding along to this essay, wishing that politics and the pesky state would just leave them alone to BUILD. This would be a fatal mistake.\nTo be sure, we must circumvent our current political paradigm. Yet this is not a separation from politics qua politics\u0026mdash;it is politics. Building a new world is the most political question imaginable. Attempting to ignore the state in order to circumvent it only worsened its dysfunctionality; counterintuitively, it also led to administrative bloat, as a government replete with nonfunctional institutions is compelled to expand (a) as new problems emerge over time. Attempting to transcend the political with flashy Harvard Business School applied-management techniques and productivity enhancer apps is a surefire way to repeat the stagnation of the 1970s and the substance-free marketing of the 1990s. Silicon Valley must recognize that it is optimized for a dysfunctional national ecosystem, and it is in everyone\u0026rsquo;s interest to realize this and push for broader societal reinvigoration. Short of this, we are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\nTo regain the will to build for real, we must first recognize where we chose to give it up in the first place. At the end of the Cold War, still armed to the teeth with ideological weapons to fight the Soviets, we looked out blinkingly over our sprawling empire (also known as \u0026ldquo;the liberal international order\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the global economy\u0026rdquo;) and fell on our sword. The doctrines of free trade and market fundamentalism were useful ideological bludgeons against communism, but they also proved just as devastating to our own system when we unwittingly turned them against (a) ourselves.\nAs a result, we chose not only to ignore the maintenance of vital production but also to intentionally disintegrate much of our advanced industrial capacity. The heady techno-optimist 1990s saw legions of McKinsey consultants setting about touting (a) flashy \u0026ldquo;unbundling\u0026rdquo; schemes to dismember the supposedly archaic core of American industry. We attempted a total separation of production from the political, in the name of increased consumption and gains from trade. Questions of community well-being or geopolitical interest were waved away or even crushed. Under this ideology, no distinction can be made between a billion dollars in GDP generated from Netflix consumption and a billion dollars in GDP generated by domestic machine tool production. Nor does it permit us to discern which sectors are vital to retain and which can be safely offshored.\nOnce we finally set about trying to rebuild American industrial capacity, we may be in for a nasty surprise. We might not have the capability anymore to simply turn industry back on. Functional industry requires a great deal of implicit knowledge that is not easily regained once traditions of manufacturing die out—like a master dying before they can find an apprentice to teach. With the material death of advanced heavy industry comes the death of once-functional institutional ecosystems, taking with them to the grave the tacit intellectual code [Tacit knowledge] that they run on.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere has yet to be a post-industrial society that has re-industrialized. America should be the first. But this is a much taller order than applying will to current capacity: we also must rebuild capabilities. Building functional industry (a) takes massive up-front investment in processes with uncertain payoffs and long time horizons. Silicon Valley VCs may continue to seed new product startups, but when it comes time to produce their products \u0026ldquo;at scale,\u0026rdquo; these firms are invariably forced to move overseas. Most of these startups are far downstream of industrial fundamentals anyway. Capital\u0026rsquo;s time preference has been far too short to combat this dynamic (a), and there is no reason to believe that it can or should play the primary role. In fact, every single country to industrialize has done so with the guidance of the state (a), marshaling huge quantities of R\u0026amp;D funding and enforcing strict export discipline to wean the infant industries in which it invests.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Wilks, Isaac. 2020. “It’s Time to Build for Good.” https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/30/its-time-to-build-for-good/.

However, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a deep understanding of Chavez and have only picked up a generally positive vibe based on what I tend to read. It\u0026rsquo;s an opinion loosely held.\n The result is San Francisco, the most innovative city in a generation, proposing a Office of Emerging Technology to require any technology that uses public space, scooters for example, to get prior permission from the city. Politics is threatening technology and progress. Builders need to take that threat seriously if they want the freedom to build.\n I lived in San Francisco during the rise of the scooters and the subsequent backlash. I recall, just after parking one and walking toward my apartment, hearing a crash and seeing that someone had thrown the scooter I was riding only a minute before down onto the sidewalk. The hate was palpable.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what policies I would pursue if I was in a position of power with regard to changes and innovations in the public space. I\u0026rsquo;m sympathetic to arguments against unaccountable companies dropping hundreds of scooters across the city and the disturbance.\n There is an emerging political consciousness in Silicon Valley. Technologists are advancing a new way of understanding the challenges facing America and how to solve them that do not split neatly along the traditional left right axis. However, to implement change along those new lines, there must be a will.\n The \u0026ldquo;X isn\u0026rsquo;t left or right\u0026rdquo;, in my experience, tends to mean \u0026ldquo;X is mostly right, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound as good to our audience\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps this one is different or perhaps my view is incomplete because \u0026ldquo;traditional left right axis\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a firm definition.\n Institution building is a political act and needs to be understood as such. Tech giants like Google have figured out how to lobby effectively for their own interests. However, that parochial view of protecting one\u0026rsquo;s domain is no longer enough. There instead needs to be a push, a demand, for a broader set of pro-innovation reforms.\nIt is not enough, however, to simply call for reforms. There must be specifics. How is the current regulatory environment stifling innovation? How is NEPA limiting infrastructure? How is the FDA limiting drug development? After the specifics comes politics.\nThe first step to politics is the same first step that a technical founder takes when hiring their first salesperson. Just call up the best political operatives you know and learn everything you can about political influence. It is possible that much of the traditional mechanisms of political influence, think tanks, lobbyists, and media, are outdated. However, there is still much value there. It\u0026rsquo;s worth approaching with an open mind to figure out what can be improved and what works well.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nHowever, part of politics will also include building new institutions. Who is creating the Y Combinator for institution builders? Who is funding their intellectual development and empowering them with a network to execute it?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGetting there, however, requires politics. It is not enough to build apps.

This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it\u0026rsquo;s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.\nMany of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed — no Western country, or state, or city was prepared — and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.\nPart of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the other part of the problem is what we didn\u0026rsquo;t \\*do\\* in advance, and what we\u0026rsquo;re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our widespread inability to \\*build\\*.\n   We see this today with the things we urgently need but don\u0026rsquo;t have:\n coronavirus tests test materials — including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents surgical masks eye shields medical gowns therapies or a vaccine — despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses the manufacturing factories required to scale [the therapy or vaccine\u0026rsquo;s] production the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it  [paraphrasing, formatting mine]\nWhy do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to — specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to \\*build\\*.\n   You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u0026rsquo;t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can\u0026rsquo;t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Westworld\u0026rdquo; wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn\u0026rsquo;t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\n I disagree that gleaming skyscrapers are the emblem of an advanced city but that\u0026rsquo;s beside the point. San Francisco, and the Bay Area in general, has a horrible housing situation which prices out all but (1) the rich, (2) those who were here early (i.e Prop 13 (“1978 California Proposition 13” 2022)), and (3) those willing to lower their standard of living by doubling or tripling up, etc. I agree with the phrasing of \u0026ldquo;choosing\u0026rdquo; not to build. Councils in the Bay Area have chosen housing stagnation by not choosing agressive housing policies to keep pace with the population and demand growth. Then again, I am sympathetic to the idea that \u0026ldquo;just because people want to come here doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we need to change to facilitate that demand\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I\u0026rsquo;d handle the situation if I were to become BDFL as I\u0026rsquo;d inherit existing infrastructure and buildings with users and owners both happy and unhappy, as well as not enough money to push through truly dramatic changes. One change I\u0026rsquo;d love to make would be to radically restrict car transport throughout the Bay Area in favor of reliable, safe, clean, etc, public transport in the form of trains, light rail, and buses. I\u0026rsquo;d need to couple this with a similarly radical densification to facilitiate that public transportation. This would involve demolishing existing single-family homes, etc, and building denser housing options. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be immediately popular or profitable and would get me laughed out of the room before work even got started.\n You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing education research that\u0026rsquo;s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect [Bloom\u0026rsquo;s 2 sigma problem]); we have the internet; why haven\u0026rsquo;t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?\n See Evidence-based education.\n You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know — and we\u0026rsquo;re experiencing right now! — the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.\n I\u0026rsquo;d assumed capital moved manufacturing offshore because doing so was cheaper than the automation Marc suggests we embrace. Knowing the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing and doing it anyway is a Coordination problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not something any single person can solve \u0026ndash; even in government. You need buy-in from multiple parties each of whom would receive individual benefits from defecting (moving manufacturing offshore) (Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma, Tragedy of the commons).\n You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?\n To address specific points:\n Supersonic aircraft aren\u0026rsquo;t better than the aircraft we have now \u0026ndash; it takes more and more fuel to fly even a little bit faster. Current air travel optimizes along that curve to move more for less. High speed trains: Yes, 100%. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have trains!? Hyperloops: They were, in my opinion of course, introduced amid peak Elon hype to derail (pun intended) policical ambition in high-speed rail and public \u0026ndash; not private! \u0026ndash; transportation. Flying cars: I don\u0026rsquo;t trust anyone I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met on the road in a flying car  That said, yes, I continue to broadly agree that we have chosen not to \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo;.\n Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I\u0026rsquo;m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don\u0026rsquo;t know — all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.\n My bias toward thinking Systems are the problem does bristle when he moves past the idea that our primary economic system might be at fault. Capitalism isn\u0026rsquo;t the only problem but it is part, and I\u0026rsquo;d say a large part, of the problem. Capitalism:\n concentrates power in the hands of the few \u0026ndash; the very people who most benefit from a system will be reluctant to make dramatic changes to that system encourages short-term thinking (Tragedy of the commons; Moloch) on timescales less, sometimes much less, than a single human lifetime   The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.\n   The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge — build new things and show the results!\nShow that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective — how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can\u0026rsquo;t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building — energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let\u0026rsquo;s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?\n Agreed. I\u0026rsquo;m tired of the American left (read: Democrats, not the actual left) whining rather than getting things done (related: You go high, we go low and The left has no place it wants to go). While they get some things done, and I am sympathetic to the structural imbalances which hinder them (e.g. congressional bias toward republican states and first-past-the-post), it\u0026rsquo;s not nearly enough and it pales to the aggressive, Never play defense, approaches employed by the American right.\nThere are systemic reasons underlying the difficulty the American left has with regard to passing policy but I view those as explanations and the party tends to present them as excuses. Just fix it. X isn\u0026rsquo;t your fault but Y is your responsibility.\n Building isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, or we\u0026rsquo;d already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We\u0026rsquo;re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.\nEvery step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you\u0026rsquo;re doing isn\u0026rsquo;t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we\u0026rsquo;ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.\nI expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u0026rsquo;s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There\u0026rsquo;s an excellent chance I\u0026rsquo;ll agree with you.\nOur nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that\u0026rsquo;s to build.\n Good conversations about progress are ones in which people both critique existing ideas and contribute new ideas. People will \u0026ndash; or at least I tend to \u0026ndash; leave conversations in which criticism dominates. Think of brainstorming, etc, and \u0026ldquo;there are no bad ideas\u0026rdquo;. Creativity is a product of volume or, in this context, good ideas are the result of picking through lots of bad ideas.\nThe first step in problem solving is to Understand and agree about the problem. This essay puts forward a good, albeit vague and almost-too-encompasing, definition of one of our problems: America isn\u0026rsquo;t building enough and we\u0026rsquo;re suffering because of it. The next steps are identifying why we aren\u0026rsquo;t building, what we need to build, how we can build it, and generally constructing a Theory of change for the future in which we can and do build.\nAs for specifics, insofar as a direction is specific, I agree with Ezra Klein\u0026rsquo;s response:\n A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions. [Meta]-building isn\u0026rsquo;t a popular pastime, and the patient, focused work it requires is particularly frustrating, in my experience, to entrepreneurial personalities.\n(Klein 2020)\n Flashcards Summarize    position ease box interval due     front 2.95 6 176.26 2023-10-01T21:20:28Z   back 2.80 6 158.86 2023-09-17T13:10:38Z    Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build\nBack  Essay decrying America\u0026rsquo;s slowing recent movement of the gears of progress compared against historic speed Key American systems have a bias toward inaction (Klein 2020)  Source (Andreessen 2020)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 7 306.46 2024-05-22T02:15:33Z   back 2.95 6 141.02 2023-08-28T15:59:37Z    (Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build) Why is it difficult to build?\nBack  The general cultural vibe toward the future is one of pessimism Those with the power to change the system benefit from it and are unwilling to change it Key American systems have a bias toward inaction  Source  Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build (Klein 2020)  References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“1978 California Proposition 13.” 2022.

However, reading someone who espouses ideas contrary to my own so confidently does inspire me to read deeper to develop specific resposnes beyond a general \u0026ldquo;this doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right\u0026rdquo;.\nNotes  We are told that conservatives \u0026ldquo;lost the culture war.\u0026rdquo; I dissent from this view: American conservatives never waged a culture war. Conservatives certainly fought, there is no denying that. They fought with every bit of obstruction and scandal their operatives could muster. But this was not a culture war. Rather, America\u0026rsquo;s conservatives fought a political war over culture. Republicans used cultural issues to gain—or to try to gain—political power. Their brightest minds and greatest efforts went into securing control of judiciary, developing a judicial philosophy for their appointees, securing control of the Capitol, and developing laws that could be implemented in multiple state houses across the nation. No actual attempt to change the culture was attempted.\n[emphasis mine]\n This seems a bizarre take from my perspective. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the nuance between waging a culture war and fighting a political war over culture. Doubly bizarre is the claim the \u0026ldquo;No actual attempt to change the culture was attempted\u0026rdquo;. Yes \u0026ndash; yes there has been. Or is there a pedantry at play with regard to terms such that pushing legislative, judicial, media, and narrative (cultural!) policies are themselves not attempts to change culture?\n Culture wars are long wars. Instilling new ideas and overthrowing existing orthodoxies takes time—usually two to three generations of time. It is a 35-50 year process.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe logic of cohort change can be grasped by the graphic at the top of this essay (Putnam includes many similar ones in his book). America\u0026rsquo;s future is godless not because the God-fearing were convinced of the errors of their faith, but because their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren never adopted their faith to start out with. Cultures do not change when people replace old ideas with new ones; cultures change when people with new ideas replace the people with old ones.\n   If you want to see this process in real time, look no further than the Democrat\u0026rsquo;s socialist wing. Older party leaders view the socialists as spoilers and madmen, political contagions not to be fought against nor partnered with, but contained and quarantined. Socialism is not something they take seriously. This is a cohort problem. Democrats under 40 take socialism very seriously. The Great Recession was their formative event; the old orthodoxy did not seem equal to the fear and heartache it caused. Thus, gradually, the younger cohorts have been won over to the socialist cause. All that keeps the socialists at bay is the power of their elders. That power cannot last. At some point in the next decade the transition point will arrive. Gradually will become suddenly, and America\u0026rsquo;s most popular party will be openly run by socialists.\nUnderstanding this is equal parts clarifying and frustrating. Clarifying, because it gives us a clear idea of what must be done and of what cannot be done. Frustration comes from that second item: as culture wars are long wars, there are no quick victories. If you reject the quickly crystalizing orthodoxy of America\u0026rsquo;s millennials, your short-term options are limited. The millennials are a lost generation; they will persist in their errors to the end of their days. Theirs is a doomed cohort—and for most of the next two decades, this doomed cohort will be in charge.\n I suppose I\u0026rsquo;m a member of the cohort discussed here and don\u0026rsquo;t see eye-to-eye with the author\u0026rsquo;s use of \u0026ldquo;doomed\u0026rdquo; or the general maligning of socialism.\nFlashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 192.43 2023-12-16T00:57:33Z    Culture wars are {{long wars}@0}.\nSource (Greer 2021)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Greer, Tanner. 2021. “Culture Wars Are Long Wars.” The Scholar’s Stage. https://scholars-stage.org/culture-wars-are-long-wars/.

One the clearest presentations of his ideas is in his 2016 book The Secret of Our Success. The book is less a heavy scholarly tome than a poppified version of Henrich\u0026rsquo;s research, but Henrich\u0026rsquo;s decision to trade theoretical detail for accessibility is understandable (it is also why I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad quoting large blocks of text from the book in this post). Henrich advances the argument that brain-power alone is not enough to explain why humans are such a successful species. Humans, he argues, are not nearly as intelligent as we think they are. Remove them from the culture and environment they have learned to operate in and they fail quickly. His favorite example of this are European explorers who die in the middle of deserts, jungles, or arctic wastes even though thousands of generations of hunter-gatherers were able to survive and thrive in these same environments. If human success was due to our ability to problem solve, analyze, and rationally develop novel solutions to novel challenges, the explorers should have been fine. Their ghastly fates suggest that rationality may not be the key to human survival.\n   Henrich makes two arguments here, both relevant to contemporary debates in politics and philosophy. The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions stick around longest when they are adaptive. This process is \u0026ldquo;blind.\u0026rdquo; Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases (like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually reduce the efficacy of the tradition [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y]. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot) understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to artificially create replacements [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence].\nI do not think Henrich is willing to extend these points to all elements of human culture. If we are to take analogies with genetic evolution seriously, then we should not be surprised if a large amount of our cultural baggage are just random accretions passed on from one generation to the next—in essence, the cultural version of genetic drift. But that is the trouble: we have no way to tell which traditions are adaptive and which are merely drift.\nAll of this meshes splendidly with the work of James C Scott.[5] (If you have never read anything by him before, I recommend starting with this essay). Scott has spent a large amount of his career studying the way states shape the societies they rule over, and the way societies try to resist the advance of the state. The central problem of ruler-ship, as Scott sees it, is what he calls legibility. To extract resources from a population the state must be able to understand that population. The state needs to make the people and things it rules legible to agents of the government. Legibility means uniformity. States dream up uniform weights and measures, impress national languages and ID numbers on their people, and divvy the country up into land plots and administrative districts, all to make the realm legible to the powers that be. The problem is that not all important things can be made legible. Much of what makes a society successful is knowledge of the tacit sort: rarely articulated, messy, and from the outside looking in, purposeless. These are the first things lost in the quest for legibility. Traditions, small cultural differences, odd and distinctive lifeways—in other words, the products of cultural evolution that Henrich fills his book with—are all swept aside by a rationalizing state that preserves (or in many cases, imposes) only what it can be understood and manipulated from the 2,000 foot view. The result, as Scott chronicles with example after example, are many of the greatest catastrophes of human history.\nNone of Scott\u0026rsquo;s works are in Henrich\u0026rsquo;s bibliography, but it is hard to imagine Henrich being surprised by this outcome. The social engineer is attempting to replace hundreds of traditions, norms, and nuggets of local knowledge through rational calculation. He is the functional equivalent of the European explorer starving in lands of plenty. The only difference between the rationalist explorer and the rationalist social engineer is that the engineer has the power to force the land to starve with him.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Greer, Tanner. 2018. “Tradition Is Smarter Than You Are.” The Scholar’s Stage. https://scholars-stage.org/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are/.

You can prove anything with arguments.\n Arguments in domains you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with can sound convincing even if they\u0026rsquo;re false. Best to ignore them. However, its useful for some people not to ignore them and instead work from something closer to First principles so we continue to advance as a culture.\nNotes  A friend recently complained about how many people lack the basic skill of believing arguments. That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or you don\u0026rsquo;t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people believe something after it had been proven to them.\nAnd I nodded my head, because it sounded reasonable enough, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until a few hours later that I thought about it again and went \u0026ldquo;Wait, no, that would be a terrible idea.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhen I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky\u0026rsquo;s Ages in Chaos is a good example of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct, so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals.\nAnd then I read the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct, so devastating, that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe I had ever been so dumb as to believe Velikovsky.\nAnd then I read the rebuttals to the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct that I felt silly for ever doubting.\nAnd so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable. [\u0026hellip;]\nGiven a total lack of independent intellectual steering power and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled crackpots who write books about Venus being a comet.\nYou could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness [Learned helplessness], where I know any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don\u0026rsquo;t even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even the slightest possibility that you might be right.\n(This is the correct Bayesian action: if I know that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way. I should ignore it and stick with my prior.)\nI consider myself lucky in that my epistemic learned helplessness is circumscribed; there are still cases where I\u0026rsquo;ll trust the evidence of my own reason. In fact, I trust it in most cases other than infamously deceptive arguments in fields I know little about. But I think the average uneducated person doesn\u0026rsquo;t and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Anyone anywhere – politicians, scammy businessmen, smooth-talking romantic partners – would be able to argue them into anything. And so they take the obvious and correct defensive maneuver – they will never let anyone convince them of any belief that sounds \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo;.\n(and remember that, if you grow up in the right circles, beliefs along the lines of \u0026ldquo;astrology doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo; sound \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo;.)\n   Responsible doctors are at the other end of the spectrum from terrorists here.

Not only are there so many terrible studies, but pseudomedicine (not the stupid homeopathy type, but the type that links everything to some obscure chemical on an out-of-the-way metabolic pathway) has, for me, proven much like pseudohistory – unless I am an expert in that particular subsubfield of medicine, it can sound very convincing even when it\u0026rsquo;s very wrong.\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 308.07 2024-05-26T05:29:15Z   back 1.90 3 6.00 2023-07-30T04:00:41Z    Epistemic Learned helplessness\nBack A condition in which the person is unable to discern a convincing argument from a true argument and resolves to ignore the argument, or at least its conclusions.\nSource (Alexander 2019)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2019. “Epistemic Learned Helplessness.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/.

The Secret Of Our Success by anthropologist Joseph Henrich manages to be an amazing book anyway.\nHenrich wants to debunk (or at least clarify) a popular view where humans succeeded because of our raw intelligence. In this view, we are smart enough to invent neat tools that help us survive and adapt to unfamiliar environments.\nAgainst such theories: we cannot actually do this. Henrich walks the reader through many stories about European explorers marooned in unfamiliar environments. These explorers usually starved to death. They starved to death in the middle of endless plenty. Some of them were in Arctic lands that the Inuit considered among their richest hunting grounds. Others were in jungles, surrounded by edible plants and animals. One particularly unfortunate group was in Alabama, and would have perished entirely if they hadn\u0026rsquo;t been captured and enslaved by local Indians first.\nThese explorers had many advantages over our hominid ancestors. For one thing, their exploration parties were made up entirely of strong young men in their prime, with no need to support women, children, or the elderly. They were often selected for their education and intelligence. Many of them were from Victorian Britain, one of the most successful civilizations in history, full of geniuses like Darwin and Galton. Most of them had some past experience with wilderness craft and survival. But despite their big brains, when faced with the task our big brains supposedly evolved for – figuring out how to do hunting and gathering in a wilderness environment – they failed pathetically.\nNor is it surprising that they failed. Hunting and gathering is actually really hard. Here\u0026rsquo;s Henrich\u0026rsquo;s description of how the Inuit hunt seals:\nYou first have to find their breathing holes in the ice. It\u0026rsquo;s important that the area around the hole be snow-covered—otherwise the seals will hear you and vanish. You then open the hole, smell it to verify it\u0026rsquo;s still in use (what do seals smell like?), and then assess the shape of the hole using a special curved piece of caribou antler. The hole is then covered with snow, save for a small gap at the top that is capped with a down indicator. If the seal enters the hole, the indicator moves, and you must blindly plunge your harpoon into the hole using all your weight. Your harpoon should be about 1.5 meters (5ft) long, with a detachable tip that is tethered with a heavy braid of sinew line. You can get the antler from the previously noted caribou, which you brought down with your driftwood bow.\nThe rear spike of the harpoon is made of extra-hard polar bear bone (yes, you also need to know how to kill polar bears; best to catch them napping in their dens). Once you\u0026rsquo;ve plunged your harpoon\u0026rsquo;s head into the seal, you\u0026rsquo;re then in a wrestling match as you reel him in, onto the ice, where you can finish him off with the aforementioned bear-bone spike.\nNow you have a seal, but you have to cook it. However, there are no trees at this latitude for wood, and driftwood is too sparse and valuable to use routinely for fires. To have a reliable fire, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to carve a lamp from soapstone (you know what soapstone looks like, right?), render some oil for the lamp from blubber, and make a wick out of a particular species of moss. You will also need water. The pack ice is frozen salt water, so using it for drinking will just make you dehydrate faster. However, old sea ice has lost most of its salt, so it can be melted to make potable water. Of course, you need to be able to locate and identify old sea ice by color and texture. To melt it, make sure you have enough oil for your soapstone lamp.\n No surprise that stranded explorers couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure all this out. It\u0026rsquo;s more surprising that the Inuit did. And although the Arctic is an unusually hostile place for humans, Henrich makes it clear that hunting-gathering techniques of this level of complexity are standard everywhere. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the Indians of Tierra del Fuego make arrows:\nAmong the Fuegians, making an arrow requires a 14-step procedure that involves using seven different tools to work six different materials. Here are some of the steps:\n– The process begins by selecting the wood for the shaft, which preferably comes from chaura, a bushy, evergreen shrub. Though strong and light, this wood is a non-intuitive choice since the gnarled branches require extensive straightening (why not start with straighter branches?).\n– The wood is heated, straightened with the craftsman\u0026rsquo;s teeth, and eventually finished with a scraper. Then, using a pre-heated and grooved stone, the shaft is pressed into the grooves and rubbed back and forth, pressing it down with a piece of fox skin. The fox skin becomes impregnated with the dust, which prepares it for the polishing stage (Does it have to be fox skin?).\n– Bits of pitch, gathered from the beach, are chewed and mixed with ash (What if you don\u0026rsquo;t include the ash?).\n– The mixture is then applied to both ends of a heated shaft, which must then be coated with white clay (what about red clay? Do you have to heat it?). This prepares the ends for the fletching and arrowhead.\n– Two feathers are used for the fletching, preferably from upland geese (why not chicken feathers?).\n– Right-handed bowman must use feathers from the left wing of the bird, and vice versa for lefties (Does this really matter?).\n– The feathers are lashed to the shaft using sinews from the back of the guanaco, after they are smoothed and thinned with water and saliva (why not sinews from the fox that I had to kill for the aforementioned skin?).\nNext is the arrowhead, which must be crafted and then attached to the shaft, and of course there is also the bow, quiver and archery skills. But, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it there, since I think you get the idea.\n How do hunter-gatherers know how to do all this? We usually summarize it as \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo;. How did it form? Not through some smart Inuit or Fuegian person reasoning it out; if that had been it, smart European explorers should have been able to reason it out too.\nThe obvious answer is \u0026ldquo;cultural evolution\u0026rdquo; [Cultural evolution], but Henrich isn\u0026rsquo;t much better than anyone else at taking the mystery out of this phrase. Trial and error must have been involved, and less successful groups/people imitating the techniques of more successful ones. But is that really a satisfying explanation?\nI found the chapter on language a helpful reminder that we already basically accept something like this is true. How did language get invented? I\u0026rsquo;m especially interested in this question because of my brief interactions with conlanging communities – people who try to construct their own languages as a hobby or as part of a fantasy universe, like Tolkien did with Elvish. Most people are terrible at this; their languages are either unusable, or exact clones of English. Only people who (like Tolkien) already have years of formal training in linguistics can do a remotely passable job. And you\u0026rsquo;re telling me the original languages were invented by cavemen? Surely there was no committee of Proto-Indo-European nomads that voted on whether to have an inflecting or agglutinating tongue? Surely nobody ran out of their cave shouting \u0026ldquo;Eureka!\u0026rdquo; after having discovered the interjection? We just kind of accept that after cavemen working really hard to communicate with each other, eventually language – still one of the most complicated and impressive productions of the human race – just sort of happened.\nTaking the generation of culture as secondary to this kind of mysterious process, Henrich turns to its transmission. If cultural generation happens at a certain rate, then the fidelity of transmission determines whether a given society advances, stagnates, or declines.\nFor Henrich, humans started becoming more than just another species of monkey when we started transmitting culture with high fidelity. Some anthropologists talk about the Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis (a) \u0026ndash; the theory that humans evolved big brains in order to succeed at social maneuvering and climbing dominance hierarchies. Henrich counters with his own Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis \u0026ndash; humans evolved big brains in order to be able to maintain things like Inuit seal hunting techniques. Everything that separates us from the apes is part of an evolutionary package designed to help us maintain this kind of culture, exploit this kind of culture, or adjust to the new abilities that this kind of culture gave us.\n II  Secret gives many examples of many culture-related adaptations, and not all are in the brain.\nOur digestive tracts evolved alongside our cultures. Specifically, they evolved to be unusually puny:\nOur mouths are the size of the squirrel monkey\u0026rsquo;s, a species that weighs less than three pounds. Chimpanzees can open their mouths twice as wide as we can and hold substantial amounts of food compressed between their lips and large teeth. We also have puny jaw muscles that reach up only to just below our ears. Other primates' jaw muscles stretch to the top of their heads, where they sometimes even latch onto a central bony ridge. Our stomachs are small, having only a third of the surface area that we\u0026rsquo;d expect for a primate of our size, and our colons are too short, being only 60% of their expected mass.\n Compared to other animals, we have such atrophied digestive tracts that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to live. What saves us? All of our food processing techniques, especially cooking, but also chopping, rinsing, boiling, and soaking. We\u0026rsquo;ve done much of the work of digestion before food even enters our mouths. Our culture teaches us how to do this, both in broad terms like \u0026ldquo;hold things over fire to cook them\u0026rdquo; and in specific terms like \u0026ldquo;this plant needs to be soaked in water for 24 hours to leach out the toxins\u0026rdquo;. Each culture has its own cooking knowledge related to the local plants and animals; a frequent cause of death among European explorers was cooking things in ways that didn\u0026rsquo;t unlock any of the nutrients, and so starving while apparently well-fed.\nFire is an especially important food processing innovation, and it is entirely culturally transmitted. Henrich is kind of cruel in his insistence on this. He recommends readers go outside and try to start a fire. He even gives some helpful hints \u0026ndash; flint is involved, rubbing two sticks together works for some people, etc. He predicts \u0026ndash; and stories I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from unfortunate campers confirm \u0026ndash; that you will not be able to do this, despite an IQ far beyond that of most of our hominid ancestors. In fact, some groups (most notably the aboriginal Tasmanians) seem to have lost the ability to make fire, and never rediscovered it. Fire-making was discovered a small number of times, maybe once, and has been culturally transmitted since then.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not just about chopping things up or roasting them. Traditional food processing techniques can get arbitrarily complicated. Nixtamalization of corn, necessary to prevent vitamin deficiencies, involves soaking the corn in a solution containing ground-up burnt seashells. The ancient Mexicans discovered this and lived off corn just fine for millennia. When the conquistadors took over, they ignored it and ate corn straight. For four hundred years, Europeans and Americans ate unnixtamalized corn. By official statistics, three million Americans came down with corn-related vitamin deficiencies during this time, and up to a hundred thousand died. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until 1937 that Western scientists discovered which vitamins were involved and developed an industrial version of nixtamalization that made corn safe. Early 1900s Americans were very smart and had lots of advantages over ancient Mexicans. But the ancient Mexicans' culture got this one right in a way it took Westerners centuries to match.\nOur hands and limbs also evolved alongside our cultures. We improved dramatically in some areas: after eons of tool use, our hands outclass those of any other ape in terms of finesse. In other cases, we devolved systems that were no longer necessary; we are much weaker than any other ape. Henrich describes a circus act of the 1940s where the ringmaster would challenge strong men in the audience to wrestle a juvenile chimpanzee. The chimpanzee was tied up, dressed in a mask that prevented it from biting, and wearing soft gloves that prevented it from scratching. No human ever lasted more than five seconds. Our common ancestor with other apes grew weaker and weaker as we became more and more reliant on artificial weapons to give us an advantage.\nEven our sweat glands evolved alongside culture. Humans are persistence hunters: they cannot run as fast as gazelles, but they can keep running for longer than gazelles (or almost anything else). Why did we evolve into that niche? The secret is our ability to carry water. Every hunter-gatherer culture has invented its own water-carrying techniques, usually some kind of waterskin. This allowed humans to switch to perspiration-based cooling systems, which allowed them to run as long as they want.\n III  But most of our differences from other apes are indeed in the brain. They\u0026rsquo;re just not where you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nTomasello et al tested human toddlers vs. apes on a series of traditional IQ type questions. The match-up was surprisingly fair; in areas like memory, logic, and spatial reasoning, the three species did about the same. But in ability to learn from another person, humans wiped the floor with the other two ape species:\n  Remember, Henrich thinks culture accumulates through random mutation. Humans don\u0026rsquo;t have control over how culture gets generated. They have more control over how much of it gets transmitted to the next generation. If 100% gets transmitted, then as more and more mutations accumulate, the culture becomes better and better. If less than 100% gets transmitted, then at some point new culture gained and old culture lost fall into equilibrium, and your society stabilizes at some higher or lower technological level. This means that transmitting culture to the next generation is maybe the core human skill. The human brain is optimized to make this work as well as possible.\nHuman children are obsessed with learning things. And they don\u0026rsquo;t learn things randomly. There seem to be \u0026ldquo;biases in cultural learning\u0026rdquo;, ie slots in an infant\u0026rsquo;s mind that they know need to be filled with knowledge, and which they preferentially seek out the knowledge necessary to fill.\nOne slot is for language. Human children naturally listen to speech (as early as in the womb). They naturally prune the phonemes they are able to produce and distinguish to the ones in the local language. And they naturally figure out how to speak and understand what people are saying, even though learning a language is hard even for smart adults.\nAnother slot is for animals. In a world where megafauna has been relegated to zoos, we still teach children their ABCs with \u0026ldquo;L is for lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B is for bear\u0026rdquo;, and children still read picture books about Mr. Frog and Mrs. Snake holding tea parties. Henrich suggests that just as the young brain is hard-coded to want to learn language, so it is hard-coded to want to learn the local animal life (maybe little boys' vehicle obsession is an outgrowth of this – buses and trains are the closest thing to local megafauna that most of them will encounter!)\nAnother slot is for plants:\nTo see this system in operation, let\u0026rsquo;s consider how infants respond to unfamiliar plants. Plants are loaded with prickly thorns, noxious oils, stinging nettles and dangerous toxins, all genetically evolved to prevent animals like us from messing with them. Given our species wide geographic range and diverse use of plants as foods, medicines and construction materials, we ought to be primed to both learn about plants and avoid their dangers. To explore this idea in the lab, the psychologists Annie Wertz and Karen Wynn first gave infants, who ranged in age from eight to eighteen months, an opportunity to touch novel plants (basil and parsley) and artifacts, including both novel objects and common ones, like wooden spoons and small lamps.\nThe results were striking. Regardless of age, many infants flatly refused to touch the plants at all. When they did touch them, they waited substantially longer than they did with the artifacts. By contrast, even with the novel objects, infants showed none of this reluctance. This suggests that well before one year of age infants can readily distinguish plants from other things, and are primed for caution with plants. But, how do they get past this conservative predisposition?\nThe answer is that infants keenly watch what other people do with plants, and are only inclined to touch or eat the plants that other people have touched or eaten. In fact, once they get the \u0026lsquo;go ahead\u0026rsquo; via cultural learning, they are suddenly interested in eating plants. To explore this, Annie and Karen exposed infants to models who both picked fruit from plants and also picked fruit-like things from an artifact of similar size and shape to the plant. The models put both the fruit and the fruit-like things in their mouths. Next, the infants were given a choice to go for the fruit (picked from the plant) or the fruit-like things picked from the object. Over 75% of the time the infants went for the fruit, not the fruit-like things, since they\u0026rsquo;d gotten the \u0026lsquo;go ahead\u0026rsquo; via cultural learning.\nAs a check, the infants were also exposed to models putting the fruit or fruit-like things behind their ears(not in their mouths). In this case, the infants went for the fruit or fruit-like things in equal measure. It seems that plants are most interesting if you can eat them, but only if you have some cultural learning cues that they aren\u0026rsquo;t toxic.\nAfter Annie first told me about her work while I was visiting Yale in 2013, I went home to test it on my 6-month-old son, Josh. Josh seemed very likely to overturn Annie\u0026rsquo;s hard empirical work, since he immediately grasped anything you gave him and put it rapidly in his mouth. Comfortable in his mom\u0026rsquo;s arms, I first offered Josh a novel plastic cube. He delighted in grabbing it and shoving it directly into his mouth, without any hesitation. Then, I offered him a sprig of arugula. He quickly grabbed it, but then paused, looked with curious uncertainty at it, and then slowly let it fall from his hand while turning to hug his mom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out how rich the psychology is here. Not only do infants have to recognize that plants are different from objects of similar size, shape and color, but they need to create categories for types of plants, like basil and parsley, and distinguish \u0026lsquo;eating\u0026rsquo; from just \u0026lsquo;touching\u0026rsquo;. It does them little good to code their observation of someone eating basil as \u0026lsquo;plants are good to eat\u0026rsquo; since that might cause them to eat poisonous plants as well as basil. But, it also does them little good to narrowly code the observation as \u0026lsquo;that particular sprig of basil is good to eat\u0026rsquo; since that particular sprig has just been eaten by the person they are watching. This another content bias in cultural learning.\n This ties into the more general phenomenon of figuring out what\u0026rsquo;s edible. Most Westerners learn insects aren\u0026rsquo;t edible; some Asians learn that they are. This feels deeper than just someone telling you insects aren\u0026rsquo;t edible and you believing them. When I was in Thailand, my guide offered me a giant cricket, telling me it was delicious. I believed him when he said it was safe to eat, I even believed him when he said it tasted good to him, but my conditioning won out – I didn\u0026rsquo;t eat the cricket. There seems to be some process where a child\u0026rsquo;s brain learns what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t locally edible, then hard-codes it against future change.\n(Or so they say; I\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to eat shrimp either.)\nAnother slot is for gender roles. By now we\u0026rsquo;ve all heard the stories of progressives who try to raise their children without any exposure to gender. Their failure has sometimes been taken as evidence that gender is hard-coded. But it can\u0026rsquo;t be quite that simple: some modern gender roles, like girls = pink, are far from obvious or universal. Instead, it looks like children have a hard-coded slot that gender roles go into, work hard to figure out what the local gender roles are (even if their parents are trying to confuse them), then latch onto them and don\u0026rsquo;t let go.\nIn the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis, humans live in obligate symbiosis with a culture. A brain without an associated culture is incomplete and not very useful. So the infant brain is adapted to seek out the important aspects of its local culture almost from birth and fill them into the appropriate slots in order to become whole.\n IV  The next part of the book discusses post-childhood learning. This plays an important role in hunter-gatherer tribes:\nWhile hunters reach their peak strength and speed in their twenties, individual hunting success does not peak until around age 30, because success depends more on know-how and refined skills than on physical prowess.\n This part of the book made most sense in the context of examples like the Inuit seal-hunting strategy which drove home just how complicated and difficult hunting-gathering was. Think less \u0026ldquo;Boy Scouts\u0026rdquo; and more \u0026ldquo;PhD\u0026rdquo;; a primitive tribesperson\u0026rsquo;s life requires mastery of various complicated technologies and skills. And the difference between \u0026ldquo;mediocre hunter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;great hunter\u0026rdquo; can be the difference between high status (and good mating opportunities) and low status, or even between life and death. Hunter-gatherers really want to learn the essentials of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and learning it is really hard. Their heuristics are:\n  Learn from people who are good at things and/or widely-respected\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t already read about the difference between dominance and prestige hierarchies, check out Kevin Simler\u0026rsquo;s blog post (a) [Kevin Simler | Social Status: Down the Rabbit Hole] on the topic. People will fear and obey authority figures like kings and chieftains, but they give a different kind of respect (\u0026ldquo;prestige\u0026rdquo;) to people who seem good at things. And since it\u0026rsquo;s hard to figure out who\u0026rsquo;s good at things (can a non-musician who wants to start learning music tell the difference between a merely good performer and one of the world\u0026rsquo;s best?) most people use the heuristic of respecting the people who other people respect. Once you identify someone as respect-worthy, you strongly consider copying them in, well, everything\nOf course, this creates the risk of prestige cascades, where some irrelevant factor (Henrich mentions being a reality show star) catapults someone to fame, everyone talks about them, and you end up with Muggeridge\u0026rsquo;s definition of a celebrity: someone famous for being famous.\nSome of this makes more sense if you go back to the evolutionary roots, and imagine watching the best hunter in your tribe to see what his secret is, or being nice to him in the hopes that he\u0026rsquo;ll take you under his wing and teach you stuff.\n(but if all this is true, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t public awareness campaigns that hire celebrity spokespeople be wild successes? Don\u0026rsquo;t they just as often fail, regardless of how famous a basketball player they can convince to lecture schoolchildren about how Winners Don\u0026rsquo;t Do Drugs?)\n  Learn from people who are like you\nIf you are a man, it is probably a bad idea to learn fashion by observing women. If you are a servant, it is probably a bad idea to learn the rules of etiquette by observing how the king behaves. People are naturally inclined to learn from people more similar to themselves.\n  Learn from old people\nHumans are almost unique in having menopause; most animals keep reproducing until they die in late middle-age. Why does evolution want humans to stick around without reproducing?\nBecause old people have already learned the local culture and can teach it to others. Henrich asks us to throw out any personal experience we have of elders; we live in a rapidly-changing world where an old person is probably \u0026ldquo;behind the times\u0026rdquo;. But for most of history, change happened glacially slowly, and old people would have spent their entire lives accumulating relevant knowledge. Imagine a Silicon Valley programmer stumped by a particularly tough bug in his code calling up his grandfather, who has seventy years' experience in the relevant programming language.\nSometimes important events only happen once in a generation. Henrich tells the story of an Australian aboriginal tribe facing a massive drought. Nobody knew what to do except Paralji, the tribe\u0026rsquo;s oldest man, who had lived through the last massive drought and remembered where his own elders had told him to find the last-resort waterholes.\n  [formatting mine]\n V  I was inspired to read Secret by Scholar\u0026rsquo;s Stage\u0026rsquo;s review (a) [Tanner Greer | Tradition Is Smarter Than You Are]. I hate to be unoriginal, but after reading the whole book, I agree that the three sections Tanner cites \u0026ndash; on divination, on manioc, and on shark taboos \u0026ndash; are by far the best and most fascinating.\nOn divination:\nWhen hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou.\nHowever, this situation is like [the Matching pennies game]. The caribou are mismatchers and the hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding those locations (where they have previously seen humans). Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing.\nCan cultural evolution compensate for our cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own decision-making biases.\nThis is not some obscure, isolated practice, and other cases of divination provide more evidence. In Indonesia, the Kantus of Kalimantan use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots. Geographer Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy, and lead them to expect floods to be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that location (which is not true). Second\u0026hellip;Kantus pay attention to others' success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. To reduce the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, Kantu rely on a system of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them avoid catastrophic crop failures. Divination results depend not only on seeing a particular bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call may be favorable, and another unfavorable).\nThe patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the 17th century when rice cultivation was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by randomizing garden locations. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On-average, over a lifetime, these farmers would do better \u0026ndash; be more successful \u0026ndash; than farmers who relied on the Gambler\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy or on copying others' immediate behavior. Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system spread throughout the agricultural populations of this Borneo region. Yet, it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions where it\u0026rsquo;s most adaptive.\n Scott Aaronson has written about how easy it is to predict people trying to \u0026ldquo;be random\u0026rdquo;:\nIn a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a simple little program that would let people type either \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; and would predict which key they were going to push next. It\u0026rsquo;s actually very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about 70% of the time. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to type randomly. They\u0026rsquo;ll have too many alternations and so on. There will be all sorts of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of probabilistic model. Even a very crude one will do well. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even beat my own program, knowing exactly how it worked. I challenged people to try this and the program was getting between 70% and 80% prediction rates. Then, we found one student that the program predicted exactly 50% of the time. We asked him what his secret was and he responded that he \u0026ldquo;just used his free will.\u0026rdquo;\n But being genuinely random is important in pursuing mixed game theoretic strategies. Henrich\u0026rsquo;s view is that divination solved this problem effectively.\nI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the Romans using augury to decide when and where to attack. This always struck me as crazy; generals are going to risk the lives of thousands of soldiers because they saw a weird bird earlier that morning? But war is a classic example of when a random strategy can be useful. If you\u0026rsquo;re deciding whether to attack the enemy\u0026rsquo;s right vs. left flank, it\u0026rsquo;s important that the enemy can\u0026rsquo;t predict your decision and send his best defenders there. If you\u0026rsquo;re generally predictable \u0026ndash; and Scott Aaronson says you are \u0026ndash; then outsourcing your decision to weird birds might be the best way to go.\nAnd then there\u0026rsquo;s manioc. This is a tuber native to the Americas. It contains cyanide, and if you eat too much of it, you get cyanide poisoning. From Henrich:\nIn the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing.\n  Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever, seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, stomach troubles, and vomiting).\nSo, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She\u0026rsquo;d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.\nThus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque\u0026mdash;an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.\nWait. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s actually rather easy to individually figure out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations. The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven\u0026rsquo;t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places, there\u0026rsquo;s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, but these techniques are spreading only slowly.\n Rationalists always wonder: how come people aren\u0026rsquo;t more rational? How come you can prove a thousand times, using Facts and Logic, that something is stupid, and yet people will still keep doing it?\nHenrich hints at an answer: for basically all of history, using reason would get you killed.\nA reasonable person would have figured out there was no way for oracle-bones to accurately predict the future. They would have abandoned divination, failed at hunting, and maybe died of starvation.\nA reasonable person would have asked why everyone was wasting so much time preparing manioc. When told \u0026ldquo;Because that\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;ve always done it\u0026rdquo;, they would have been unsatisfied with that answer. They would have done some experiments, and found that a simpler process of boiling it worked just as well. They would have saved lots of time, maybe converted all their friends to the new and easier method. Twenty years later, they would have gotten sick and died, in a way so causally distant from their decision to change manioc processing methods that nobody would ever have been able to link the two together.\nHenrich discusses pregnancy taboos in Fiji; pregnant women are banned from eating sharks. Sure enough, these sharks contain chemicals that can cause birth defects. The women didn\u0026rsquo;t really know why they weren\u0026rsquo;t eating the sharks, but when anthropologists demanded a reason, they eventually decided it was because their babies would be born with shark skin rather than human skin. As explanations go, this leaves a lot to be desired. How come you can still eat other fish? Aren\u0026rsquo;t you worried your kids will have scales? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t the slightest familiarity with biology prove this mechanism is garbage? But if some smart independent-minded iconoclastic Fijian girl figured any of this out, she would break the taboo and her child would have birth defects.\nIn giving humans reason at all, evolution took a huge risk. Surely it must have wished there was some other way, some path that made us big-brained enough to understand tradition, but not big-brained enough to question it. Maybe it searched for a mind design like that and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find one. So it was left with this ticking time-bomb, this ape that was constantly going to be able to convince itself of hare-brained and probably-fatal ideas.\nHere, too, culture came to the rescue. One of the most important parts of any culture \u0026ndash; more important than the techniques for hunting seals, more important than the techniques for processing tubers \u0026ndash; is techniques for making sure nobody ever questions tradition. Like the belief that anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t conform is probably a witch who should be cast out lest they bring destruction upon everybody. Or the belief in a God who has commanded certain specific weird dietary restrictions, and will torture you forever if you disagree. Or the fairy tales where the prince asks a wizard for help, and the wizard says \u0026ldquo;You may have everything you wish forever, but you must never nod your head at a badger\u0026rdquo;, and then one day the prince nods his head at a badger, and his whole empire collapses into dust, and the moral of the story is that you should always obey weird advice you don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a monster at the end of this book. Humans evolved to transmit culture with high fidelity. And one of the biggest threats to transmitting culture with high fidelity was Reason. Our ancestors lived in Epistemic Hell [I\u0026rsquo;d say we currently live in Less-Hell as opposed to No-Hell], where they had to constantly rely on causally opaque processes with justifications that couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be true, and if they ever questioned them then they might die. Historically, Reason has been the villain of the human narrative, a corrosive force that tempts people away from adaptive behavior towards choices that \u0026ldquo;sounded good at the time\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy are people so bad at reasoning? For the same reason they\u0026rsquo;re so bad at letting poisonous spiders walk all over their face without freaking out. Both \u0026ldquo;skills\u0026rdquo; are really bad ideas, most of the people who tried them died in the process, so evolution removed those genes from the population, and successful cultures stigmatized them enough to give people an internalized fear of even trying.\n VI  This book belongs alongside Seeing Like A State [James C. Scott | Seeing like a State] and the works of G.K. Chesterton [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence] as attempts to justify tradition, and to argue for organically-evolved institutions over top-down planning. What unique contribution does it make to this canon?\nFirst, a lot more specifically anthropological / paleoanthropological rigor than the other two.\nSecond, a much crisper focus: Chesterton had only the fuzziest idea that he was writing about cultural evolution, and Scott was only a little clearer. I think Henrich is the only one of the three to use the term, and once you hear it, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously the right framing.\nThird, a sense of how traditions contain the meta-tradition of defending themselves against Reason, and a sense for why this is necessary.\nAnd fourth, maybe we\u0026rsquo;re not at the point where we really want unique contributions yet. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re still at the point where we have to have this hammered in by more and more examples. The temptation is always to say \u0026ldquo;Ah, yes, a few simple things like taboos against eating poisonous plants may be relics of cultural evolution, but obviously by now we\u0026rsquo;re at the point where we know which traditions are important vs. random looniness, and we can rationally stick to the important ones while throwing out the garbage.\u0026rdquo; And then somebody points out to you that actually divination using oracle bones was one of the important traditions, and if you thought you knew better than that and tried to throw it out, your civilization would falter.\n Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 272.87 2024-04-05T21:07:04Z    For basically all of history, using reason could {{get you killed}@0}.\nSource (Alexander 2019)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2019. “Book Review: The Secret Of Our Success.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/.

Scott | Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.\nNotes I  Scott starts with the story of \u0026ldquo;scientific forestry\u0026rdquo; in 18th century Prussia. Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, like a chump. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.\nThis went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn\u0026rsquo;t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and \u0026ldquo;scientific forestry\u0026rdquo; spread across Europe and the world.\nAnd this pattern repeats with suspicious regularity across history, not just in biological systems but also in social ones.\nNatural organically-evolved cities tend to be densely-packed mixtures of dark alleys, tiny shops, and overcrowded streets. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of identical giant Brutalist apartment buildings separated by wide boulevards, with everything separated into carefully-zoned districts. Yet for some reason, whenever these new rational cities were built, people hated them and did everything they could to move out into more organic suburbs. And again, for some reason the urban planners got promoted, became famous, and spread their destructive techniques around the world.\nYe olde organically-evolved peasant villages tended to be complicated confusions of everybody trying to raise fifty different crops at the same time on awkwardly shaped cramped parcels of land. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: giant collective mechanized farms growing purpose-bred high-yield crops and arranged in (say it with me) evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these giant collective farms had lower yields per acre than the old traditional methods, and wherever they arose famine and mass starvation followed. And again, for some reason governments continued to push the more \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; methods, whether it was socialist collectives in the USSR, big agricultural corporations in the US, or sprawling banana plantations in the Third World.\nTraditional lifestyles of many East African natives were nomadic, involving slash-and-burn agriculture in complicated jungle terrain according to a bewildering variety of ad-hoc rules. Modern scientific rationalists in African governments (both colonial and independent) came up with a better idea – resettlement of the natives into villages, where they could have modern amenities like schools, wells, electricity, and evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these villages kept failing: their crops died, their economies collapsed, and their native inhabitants disappeared back into the jungle. And again, for some reason the African governments kept trying to bring the natives back and make them stay, even if they had to blur the lines between villages and concentration camps to make it work.\nWhy did all of these schemes fail? And more importantly, why were they celebrated, rewarded, and continued, even when the fact of their failure became too obvious to ignore? Scott gives a two part answer.\nThe first part of the story is High Modernism [High modernism], an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific philosophy. The High Modernists claimed to be about figuring out the most efficient and high-tech way of doing things, but most of them knew little relevant math or science and were basically just LARPing being rational by placing things in evenly-spaced rectangular grids.\nBut the High Modernists were pawns in service of a deeper motive: the centralized state wanted the world to be \u0026ldquo;legible\u0026rdquo; [Legible], ie arranged in a way that made it easy to monitor and control. An intact forest might be more productive than an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of Norway spruce, but it was harder to legislate rules for, or assess taxes on.\nThe state promoted the High Modernists' platitudes about The Greater Good as cover [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y], in order to implement the totalitarian schemes they wanted to implement anyway. The resulting experiments were usually failures by the humanitarian goals of the Modernists, but resounding successes by the command-and-control goals of the state. And so we gradually transitioned from systems that were messy but full of fine-tuned hidden order, to ones that were barely-functional but really easy to tax.\n II Examples and quotes from (Scott 2020) illustrating the difficulty of ruling/administering a population which lacks certain shared standards (e.g. weights, measures, definitions of what is \u0026ldquo;taxable land\u0026rdquo;).\nIII  The moral of the story is: premodern states had very limited ability to tax their citizens effectively. Along with the problems mentioned above – nonstandardized measurement, nonstandardized property rights, nonstandardized personal names – we can add a few others. At this point national languages were a cruel fiction; local \u0026ldquo;dialects\u0026rdquo; could be as different from one another as eg Spanish is from Portuguese, so villagers might not even be able to understand the tax collectors. Worst of all, there was no such thing as a census in France until the 17th century, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a good idea of how many people or villages there were.\nKings usually solved this problem by leaving the tax collection up to local lords, who presumably knew the idiosyncracies of their own domains. But one step wasn\u0026rsquo;t always enough. If the King only knew Dukes, and the Dukes only knew Barons, and the Barons only knew village headmen, and it was only the village headmen who actually knew anything about the peasants, then you needed a four-step chain to get any taxes. Each link in the chain had an incentive to collect as much as they could and give up as little as they could get away with. So on the one end, the peasants were paying backbreaking punitive taxes. And on the other, the Royal Treasurer was handing the King half a loaf of moldy bread and saying \u0026ldquo;Here you go, Sire, apparently this is all the grain in France.\u0026rdquo;\nSo from the beginning, kings had an incentive to make the country \u0026ldquo;legible\u0026rdquo; – that is, so organized and well-indexed that it was easy to know everything about everyone and collect/double-check taxes. Also from the beginning, nobles had an incentive to frustrate the kings so that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be out of a job. And commoners, who figured that anything which made it easier for the State to tax them and interfere in their affairs was bad news, usually resisted too.\n IV  So the early modern period is defined by an uneasy truce between states who want to be able to count and standardize everything, and citizens who don\u0026rsquo;t want to let them. Enter High Modernism [High modernism].\n   Scott uses Le Corbusier as the epitome of five High Modernist principles.\n [T]here can be no compromise with the existing infrastructure. It was designed by superstitious people who didn\u0026rsquo;t have architecture degrees, or at the very least got their architecture degrees in the past and so were insufficiently Modern. The more completely it is bulldozed to make way for the Glorious Future, the better. [H]uman needs can be abstracted and calculated. A human needs X amount of food. A human needs X amount of water. A human needs X amount of light, and prefers to travel at X speed, and wants to live within X miles of the workplace. These needs are easily calculable by experiment, and a good city is the one built to satisfy these needs and ignore any competing frivolities. [T]he solution is the solution. It is universal. The rational design for Moscow is the same as the rational design for Paris is the same as the rational design for Chandigarh, India. As a corollary, all of these cities ought to look exactly the same. It is maybe permissible to adjust for obstacles like mountains or lakes. But only if you are on too short a budget to follow the rationally correct solution of leveling the mountain and draining the lake to make your city truly optimal. [A]ll of the relevant rules should be explicitly determined by technocrats, then followed to the letter by their subordinates. Following these rules is better than trying to use your intuition, in the same way that using the laws of physics to calculate the heat from burning something is better than just trying to guess, or following an evidence-based clinical algorithm is better than just prescribing whatever you feel like. [T]here is nothing whatsoever to be gained or learned from the people involved (eg the city\u0026rsquo;s future citizens). You are a rational modern scientist with an architecture degree who has already calculated out the precise value for all relevant urban parameters. They are yokels who probably cannot even spell the word architecture, let alone usefully contribute to it. They probably make all of their decisions based on superstition or tradition or something, and their input should be ignored For Their Own Good.  [formatting mine]\n   What happened? Scott writes:\nMost of those who have moved to Brasilia from other cities are amazed to discover \u0026ldquo;that it is a city without crowds.\u0026rdquo; People complain that Brasilia lacks the bustle of street life, that it has none of the busy street corners and long stretches of storefront facades that animate a sidewalk for pedestrians. For them, it is almost as if the founders of Brasilia, rather than having planned a city, have actually planned to prevent a city. The most common way they put it is to say that Brasilia \u0026ldquo;lacks street corners,\u0026ldquo;by which they mean that it lacks the complex intersections of dense neighborhoods comprising residences and public cafes and restaurants with places for leisure, work, and shopping.\nWhile Brasilia provides well for some human needs, the functional separation of work from residence and of both from commerce and entertainment, the great voids between superquadra, and a road system devoted exclusively to motorized traffic make the disappearance of the street corner a foregone conclusion. The plan did eliminate traffic jams; it also eliminated the welcome and familiar pedestrian jams that one of Holston\u0026rsquo;s informants called \u0026ldquo;the point of social conviviality\nThe term brasilite, meaning roughly Brasilia-itis,which was coined by the first-generation residents, nicely captures the trauma they experienced. As a mock clinical condition, it connotes a rejection of the standardization and anonymity of life in Brasilia. \u0026ldquo;They use the term brasilite to refer to their feelings about a daily life without the pleasures-the distractions, conversations, flirtations, and little rituals of outdoor life in other Brazilian cities.\u0026rdquo; Meeting someone normally requires seeing them either at their apartment [First place] or at work [Second place]. Even if we allow for the initial simplifying premise of Brasilia\u0026rsquo;s being an administrative city, there is nonetheless a bland anonymity built into the very structure of the capital. The population simply lacks the small accessible spaces that they could colonize and stamp with the character of their activity, as they have done historically in Rio and Sao Paulo. To be sure, the inhabitants of Brasilia haven\u0026rsquo;t had much time to modify the city through their practices, but the city is designed to be fairly recalcitrant to their efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;Brasilite,\u0026rdquo; as a term, also underscores how the built environment affects those who dwell in it. Compared to life in Rio and Sao Paulo, with their color and variety, the daily round in bland, repetitive, austere Brasilia must have resembled life in a sensory deprivation tank. The recipe for high-modernist urban planning, while it may have created formal order and functional segregation, did so at the cost of a sensorily impoverished and monotonous environment-an environment that inevitably took its toll on the spirits of its residents.\nThe anonymity induced by Brasilia is evident from the scale and exterior of the apartments that typically make up each residential superquadra. For superquadra residents, the two most frequent complaints are the sameness of the apartment blocks and the isolation of the residences (\u0026ldquo;In Brasilia, there is only house and work\u0026rdquo;). The facade of each block is strictly geometric and egalitarian. Nothing distinguishes the exterior of one apartment from another; there are not even balconies that would allow residents to add distinctive touches and create semipublic spaces.\n [\u0026hellip;]\nI never really \u0026ldquo;got\u0026rdquo; Jane Jacobs. I originally interpreted her as arguing that it was great for cities to be noisy and busy and full of crowds, and that we should build neighborhoods that are confusing and hard to get through to force people to interact with each other and prevent them from being able to have privacy, and no one should be allowed to live anywhere quiet or nice. As somebody who (thanks to the public school system, etc) has had my share of being forced to interact with people, and of being placed in situations where it is deliberately difficult to have any privacy or time to myself, I figured Jane Jacobs was just a jerk.\nBut Scott has kind of made me come around. He rehabilitates her as someone who was responding to the very real excesses of High Modernism. She was the first person who really said \u0026ldquo;Hey, maybe people like being in cute little neighborhoods\u0026rdquo;. Her complaint wasn\u0026rsquo;t really against privacy or order per se as it was against extreme High Modernist perversions of those concepts that people empirically hated. And her background makes this all too understandable – she started out as a journalist covering poor African-Americans who lived in the projects and had some of the same complaints as Brazilians.\nHer critique of Le Corbusierism was mostly what you would expect, but Scott extracts some points useful for their contrast with the Modernist points earlier:\n [E]xisting structures are evolved organisms built by people trying to satisfy their social goals. They contain far more wisdom about people\u0026rsquo;s needs and desires than anybody could formally enumerate. Any attempt at urban planning should try to build on this encoded knowledge, not detract from it. [M]an does not live by bread alone. People don\u0026rsquo;t want the right amount of Standardized Food Product, they want social interaction, culture, art, coziness, and a host of other things nobody will ever be able to calculate. Existing structures have already been optimized for these things, and unless you\u0026rsquo;re really sure you understand all of them, you should be reluctant to disturb them [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence]. [S]olutions are local. Americans want different things than Africans or Indians. One proof of this is that New York looks different from Lagos and from Delhi. Even if you are the world\u0026rsquo;s best American city planner, you should be very concerned that you have no idea what people in Africa need, and you should be very reluctant to design an African city without extensive consultation of people who understand the local environment. [E]ven a very smart and well-intentioned person who is on board with points 1-3 will never be able to produce a set of rules. Most of people\u0026rsquo;s knowledge is implicit [Implicit knowledge], and most rule codes are quickly replaced by informal systems [Tacit knowledge] of things that work which are much more effective (the classic example of this is work-to-rule [Work-to-rule] strikes). [A]lthough well-educated technocrats may understand principles which give them some advantages in their domain, they are hopeless without the on-the-ground experience of the people they are trying to serve, whose years of living in their environment and dealing with it every day have given them a deep practical knowledge which is difficult to codify.  [formatting mine]\n V  Even in less exotic locales like Russia, the peasant farmers were extraordinary experts on the conditions of their own farms, their own climates, and their own crops. Take all of these people, transport them a thousand miles away, and give them a perfectly rectangular grid to grow Wheat Cultivar #6 on, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n VI  So if this was such a bad idea, why did everyone keep doing it?\n In short, governing bodies continued (and continue) to push these solutions not because they solve the people\u0026rsquo;s problems but because they solve the problems the governing bodies have.\n Historically, the relative illegibility to outsiders of some urban neighborhoods has provided a vital margin of political safety from control by outside elites. A simple way of determining whether this margin exists is to ask if an outsider would have needed a local guide in order to find her way successfully. If the answer is yes, then the community or terrain in question enjoys at least a small measure of insulation from outside intrusion. Coupled with patterns of local solidarity, this insulation has proven politically valuable in such disparate contexts as eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century urban riots over bread prices in Europe, the Front de Liberation Nationale\u0026rsquo;s tenacious resistance to the French in the Casbah of Algiers, and the politics of the bazaar that helped to bring down the Shah of Iran. Illegibility, then, has been and remains a reliable resource for political autonomy\n This was a particular problem in Paris, which was famous for a series of urban insurrections in the 19th century (think Les Miserables, but about once every ten years or so). Although these generally failed, they were hard to suppress because locals knew the \u0026ldquo;terrain\u0026rdquo; and the streets were narrow enough to barricade. Slums full of poor people gathered together formed tight communities where revolutionary ideas could easily spread. The late 19th-century redesign of Paris had the explicit design of destroying these areas and splitting up poor people somewhere far away from the city center where they couldn\u0026rsquo;t do any harm.\n   So although modernist cities and farms may have started out as attempts to help citizens with living and farming, they ended up as contributors to the great government project of legibility and taxing people effectively.\nSeeing Like A State summarizes the sort of on-the-ground ultra-empirical knowledge that citizens have of city design and peasants of farming as metis, a Greek term meaning \u0026ldquo;practical wisdom\u0026rdquo;. I was a little concerned about this because they seem like two different things. The average citizen knows nothing about city design and in fact does not design cities; cities sort of happen in a weird way through cultural evolution or whatever. The average farmer knows a lot about farming (even if it is implicit and not as book learning) and applies that knowledge directly in how they farm. But Scott thinks these are more or less the same thing, that this thing is a foundation of successful communities and industries, and that ignoring and suppressing it is what makes collective farms and modernist planned cities so crappy. He generalizes this further to almost every aspect of a society \u0026ndash; its language, laws, social norms, and economy. But this is all done very quickly, and I feel like there was a sleight of hand between \u0026ldquo;each farmer eventually figures out how to farm well\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;social norms converge on good values\u0026rdquo;.\nInsofar as Scott squares the above circle, he seems to think that many actors competing with each other will eventually carve out a beneficial equilibrium better than that of any centralized authority. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mesh will with my own fear that many actors competing with each other will eventually shoot themselves in the foot and destroy everything, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really seen a careful investigation of when we get one versus the other.\n VII  What are we to make of all of this?\nWell, for one thing, Scott basically admits to stacking the dice against High Modernism and legibility. He admits that the organic livable cities of old had life expectancies in the forties because nobody got any light or fresh air and they were all packed together with no sewers and so everyone just died of cholera. He admits that at some point agricultural productivity multiplied by like a thousand times and the Green Revolution saved millions of lives and all that, and probably that has something to do with scientific farming methods and rectangular grids. He admits that it\u0026rsquo;s pretty convenient having a unit of measurement that local lords can\u0026rsquo;t change whenever they feel like it. Even modern timber farms seem pretty successful. After all those admissions, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to see what\u0026rsquo;s left of his case.\n(also, I grew up in Irvine, the most planned of planned cities, and I loved it.)\nWhat Scott eventually says is that he\u0026rsquo;s not against legibility and modernism per se, but he wants to present them as ingredients in a cocktail of state failure. You need a combination of four things to get a disaster like Soviet collective farming (or his other favorite example, compulsory village settlement in Tanzania). First, a government incentivized to seek greater legibility for its population and territory. Second, a High Modernist ideology. Third, authoritarianism. And fourth, a \u0026ldquo;prostrate civil society\u0026rdquo;, like in Russia after the Revolution, or in colonies after the Europeans took over.\nI think his theory is that the back-and-forth between centralized government and civil society allows scientific advances to be implemented smoothly instead of just plowing over everyone in a way that leads to disaster. I also think that maybe a big part of it is incremental versus sudden: western farming did well because it got to incrementally add advances and see how they worked, but when you threw the entire edifice at Tanzania it crashed and burned.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not really sure what\u0026rsquo;s left. Authoritarianism is bad? Destroying civil society is bad? You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do things when you have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and all you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go on is your rectangle fetish? The book contained some great historical tidbits, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what overarching lesson I learned from it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t think Scott\u0026rsquo;s preference for metis over scientific omnipotence has value. I think it has lots of value. I see this all the time in psychiatry, which always has been and to some degree still is really High Modernist. We are educated people who know a lot about mental health, dealing with a poor population who (in the case of one of my patients) refers to Haldol as \u0026ldquo;Hound Dog\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get in the trap of thinking that you know better than these people, especially since you often do (I will never understand how many people are shocked when I diagnose their sleep disorder as having something to do with them drinking fifteen cups of coffee a day).\nBut psychiatric patients have a metis of dealing with their individual diseases the same way peasants have a metis of dealing with their individual plots of land. My favorite example of this is doctors who learn their patients are taking marijuana, refuse to keep prescribing them their vitally important drugs unless the patient promises to stop, and then gets surprised when the patients end up decompensating because the marijuana was keeping them together. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying smoking marijuana is a good thing. I\u0026rsquo;m saying that for some people it\u0026rsquo;s a load-bearing piece of their mental edifice. And if you take it away without any replacement they will fall apart. And they have explained this to you a thousand times and you didn\u0026rsquo;t believe them.\nThere are so many fricking patients who respond to sedative medications by becoming stimulated, or stimulant medications by becoming sedated, or who become more anxious whenever they do anti-anxiety exercises, or who hallucinate when placed on some super common medication that has never caused hallucinations in anyone else, or who become suicidal if you try to reassure them that things aren\u0026rsquo;t so bad, or any other completely perverse and ridiculous violation of the natural order that you can think of. And the only redeeming feature of all of this is that the patients themselves know all of this stuff super-well and are usually happy to tell you if you ask.\nI can totally imagine going into a psychiatric clinic armed with the Evidence-Based Guidelines the same way Le Corbusier went into Moscow and Paris armed with his Single Rational City Plan and the same way the agricultural scientists went into Tanzania armed with their List Of Things That Definitely Work In Europe. I expect it would have about the same effect for about the same reason.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo fine, Scott is completely right here. But I\u0026rsquo;m only bringing this up because it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve already thought about. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t already believe this, I\u0026rsquo;d be indifferent between applying the narrative of the wise Tanzanian farmers knowing more than their English colonizers, versus the narrative of the dumb yokels who refuse to get vaccines because they might cause autism. Heuristics work until they don\u0026rsquo;t. Scott provides us with these great historical examples of local knowledge outdoing scientific acumen, but other stories present us with great historical examples of the opposite, and when to apply which heuristic seems really unclear. Even \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t bulldoze civil society and try to change everything at once\u0026rdquo; goes astray sometimes; the Meiji Restoration was wildly successful by doing exactly that.\n Flashcards See James C.

Cheap global talk and travel continue to tie our global economy and culture more closely together. But in the distant future, our descendants will probably have spread out across space, and redesigned their minds and bodies to explode Cambrian-style into a vast space of possible creatures. If they are free enough to choose where to go and what to become, our distant descendants will fragment into diverse local economies and cultures.\nGiven a similar freedom of fertility, most of our distant descendants will also live near a subsistence level. Per-capita wealth has only been rising lately because income has grown faster than population. But if income only doubled every century, in a million years that would be a factor of 103000, which seems (a) impossible to achieve with only the 1070 atoms of our galaxy available by then. Yes we have seen a remarkable demographic transition, wherein richer nations have fewer kids, but we already see contrarian subgroups like Hutterites, Hmongs, or Mormons that grow much faster. So unless strong central controls prevent it, over the long run such groups will easily grow (a) faster than the economy, making per person income drop to near subsistence levels. Even so, they will be basically happy (a) in such a world.\nOur distant descendants will also likely have hit diminishing returns to discovery; by then most everything worth knowing will be known by many; truly new and important discoveries will be quite rare. Complete introspection will be feasible, and immortality will be available to the few who can afford it. Wild nature will be mostly gone, and universal coordination and destruction will both be far harder than today.\nSo what will these distant descendants think of their ancestors? They will find much in common with our distant hunting ancestors, who also continued for ages at near subsistence level in a vast fragmented world with slow growth amid rare slow contact with strange distant cultures. While those ancestors were quite ignorant about their world, and immersed in a vast wild nature instead of a vast space of people, their behavior was still pretty well adapted to the world they lived in. While they suffered many misconceptions, those illusions rarely made them much worse off; their behavior was usually adaptive.\nWhen our distant descendants think about our era, however, differences will loom larger. Yes they will see that we were more like them in knowing more things, and in having less contact with a wild nature. But our brief period of very rapid growth and discovery and our globally integrated economy and culture will be quite foreign to them. Yet even these differences will pale relative to one huge difference: our lives are far more dominated by consequential delusions: wildly false beliefs and non-adaptive values that matter. While our descendants may explore delusion-dominated virtual realities, they will well understand that such things cannot be real, and don\u0026rsquo;t much influence history. In contrast, we live in the brief but important \u0026ldquo;dreamtime\u0026rdquo; when delusions drove history. Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nPerhaps most important, our descendants may remember how history hung by a precarious thread on a few crucial coordination choices that our highly integrated rapidly changing world did or might have allowed us to achieve, and the strange delusions that influenced such choices. These choices might have been about global warming, rampaging robots, nuclear weapons, bioterror, etc.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Hanson, Robin. n.d. “This Is the Dream Time.” Accessed June 21, 2022. https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html.

Higher filter efficiency means lower filter leakage.\n  The choice of facepiece depends on the level of protection needed–that is, the assigned protection factor (APF) needed.\n  (“NIOSH Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators Certified under 42 CFR 84.” 2020), formatting mine\n Respirator for crystalline silica  NIOSH recommends the use of half-facepiece particulate respirators with N95 or better filters for airborne exposures to crystalline silica at concentrations less than or equal to 0.5 mg/m3.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL) remains 50 μg/m3 today.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe improved filtering efficiency characteristics of the particulate filters certified according to 42 CFR 84, compared to DM filters, result in filter ef- ficiencies of at least 95% for all sizes of silica dust; consequently, 100-rated filter efficiency (99.97%) is not required to achieve an APF of 10 in a properly fitted half-facepiece particulate respirator for crystalline silica exposures.\n(“NIOSH Policy Statement: Respiratory Protection Recommendations for Airborne Exposures to Crystalline Silica.” 2008)\n Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 6 113.11 2023-08-23T02:05:05Z    For crystalline silica, use a {{n95 or better}{type}@0} filter.\nSource (“NIOSH Policy Statement: Respiratory Protection Recommendations for Airborne Exposures to Crystalline Silica.” 2008)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“NIOSH Guide to the Selection and Use of Particulate Respirators Certified under 42 CFR 84.” 2020, October. https://doi.org/10.26616/NIOSHPUB96101. “NIOSH Policy Statement: Respiratory Protection Recommendations for Airborne Exposures to Crystalline Silica.” 2008.

With the decline of antiquity and the spread of Christianity, the concept fell into disuse in the Western world, with the exception of 19th century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who resurrected it as a thought experiment.","title":"Eternal return"},{"content":"Flashcards Author    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 8 396.54 2024-04-04T03:58:49Z    Dmytro Matsypura\nBack Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nBacklinks  Jessica Leung, Dmytro Matsypura | Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares  ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/8f382815-45a4-4eaf-9d0c-a5a0c27adbe8/","summary":"Flashcards Author    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 8 396.54 2024-04-04T03:58:49Z    Dmytro Matsypura\nBack Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nBacklinks  Jessica Leung, Dmytro Matsypura | Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares  ","title":"Dmytro Matsypura"},{"content":"Flashcards Author    position ease box interval due     front 2.20 7 148.03 2023-08-31T17:05:12Z    Jessica Leung\nBack Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nBacklinks  Jessica Leung, Dmytro Matsypura | Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares  ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/7229c3b7-41df-4122-88ab-0a808cc272af/","summary":"Flashcards Author    position ease box interval due     front 2.20 7 148.03 2023-08-31T17:05:12Z    Jessica Leung\nBack Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nBacklinks  Jessica Leung, Dmytro Matsypura | Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares  ","title":"Jessica Leung"},{"content":"Jessica Leung, Dmytro Matsypura, (Leung and Matsypura 2019)\nThis is the Python companion to VMLS.\nSummary Thoughts Notes Flashcards Source    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 7 179.18 2023-12-14T18:46:19Z    Python Language Companion to Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nBack  Jessica Leung Dmytro Matsypura  References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Leung, Jessica, and Dmytro Matsypura. 2019.

A final scan of all the edges is performed and if any distance is updated, then a path of length \\(|V|\\) edges has been found which can only occur if at least one negative cycle exists in the graph.\n(“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\n Bellman-Ford implementation in Python\nFlashcards Compare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 7 291.51 2024-04-17T13:59:00Z    Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm\nBack  Both solve the Single-pair and Single-source shortest path problem Bellman-Ford algorithm supports negative weights whereas Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm doesn\u0026rsquo;t  Source  (“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022) (“Dijkstra’s Algorithm” 2022)  Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 6 133.28 2023-07-29T20:12:26Z   1 2.65 7 269.55 2024-03-20T02:35:03Z    Failure cases for {{Bellman-Ford algorithm}@0} are {{Negative cycles}@1}, but not negative edges.\nSource (“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 347.49 2024-07-02T03:03:32Z    Bellman-Ford algorithm is {{slower}{speed}@0} than Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm\nSource (“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 1.60 6 25.44 2023-07-24T03:57:13Z    Time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm is {{\\(\\bigtheta{|V||E|}\\)}@0}.\nSource (“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 300.07 2024-05-05T17:19:30Z    Bellman-Ford algorithm iterates over {{Edges}@0}\nSource (“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 5 32.99 2023-08-13T12:49:56Z   back 2.95 6 152.57 2023-09-03T05:07:29Z    Iterations in Bellman-Ford algorithm\nBack The algorithm iterates through all edges in the graph \\(|V|\\) times.\n The first \\(|V|-1\\) times are to solve the Single-source shortest path problem.

It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.\nAt each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes\n\\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\)\nwhere n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. A* terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended. The heuristic function is problem-specific.\n(“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\n   Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm], as another example of a uniform-cost search algorithm, can be viewed as a special case of A* where \\(h(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\).\n(“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\n Like Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm, A*\u0026rsquo;s implementation uses Dynamic programming.\nWhat does the \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; mean?  The reason is that scientists first came up with an improved version of the Dijkstra algorithm they called A1. Later on, the inventors of A* discovered an improvement of A1 that they called A2. These people then managed to prove that A2 was actually optimal under some assumptions on the heuristic in use. Because A2 was optimal, it was renamed A*. In science, and in optimisation in particular, a \u0026quot; * \u0026quot; symbol is often used to denote optimal solutions. Some also interpret the \u0026quot; * \u0026quot; as meaning \u0026ldquo;any version number\u0026rdquo; since it was proven impossible to build an \u0026ldquo;A3\u0026rdquo; algorithm that would outperform A2/A*.\nBy the way, in this context, \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it reaches the optimal solution, but that it does so while exploring the minimum number of nodes. Of course, A* is also complete, which means it reaches the optimal solution (if we use an admissible heuristic).\n(francoisr 2016)\n Flashcards Example(s)    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 7 204.76 2023-11-30T11:03:44Z    Heuristics for A-star search algorithm\nBack  Manhattan distance Euclidian distance  Source (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 171.77 2023-10-31T10:39:06Z    The time complexity of A* {{depends on the heuristic}@0}.\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDenotes    position ease box interval due     0 2.95 6 161.79 2023-09-01T11:01:05Z   1 2.95 6 159.38 2023-09-01T22:32:15Z    {{The *, for example in A*,}@0} denotes {{optimal solutions}@1}\nSource (francoisr 2016)\nCloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 7 214.24 2024-01-06T20:19:07Z   1 2.35 7 167.65 2023-11-10T06:04:18Z    A* is {{optimal}{property}@0} if {{it uses an Admissible heuristic}@1}\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 261.66 2024-03-10T17:14:01Z   back 2.95 6 133.50 2023-07-29T01:58:42Z    \\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\) (A*)\nBack A* selects the path which minimizes the sum of:\n The cost of the path from the start node to \\(n\\) The value of the heuristic function at \\(n\\)  Source (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDenotes    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 277.23 2024-04-05T06:37:30Z   1 2.50 7 296.99 2024-04-30T00:08:07Z     {{\\(f(n)\\)}@0}  {{The cost of the path from the start node to the target node}@1} (A*)\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDenotes (A*)    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 261.35 2024-03-11T21:43:15Z   1 2.20 7 118.96 2023-09-06T15:15:25Z     {{\\(g(n)\\)}@0}  {{The cost of the path from the start node to \\(n\\)}@1}\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDenotes    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 6 141.86 2023-08-13T14:23:05Z   1 2.95 6 159.95 2023-09-03T16:01:09Z     {{\\(h(n)\\)}@0}  {{The heuristic function which estimates the cost of the path from \\(n\\) to the target node}@1} (A*)\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nCompare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 6 137.54 2023-08-06T06:16:48Z    Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm and A*\nBack  Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm can solve both the Single-pair and Single-source shortest path problem whereas A* can only solve the Single-pair shortest path problem A* is Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm plus a heuristic function  Source  (“Dijkstra’s Algorithm” 2022) (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)  Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 324.37 2024-06-06T22:28:43Z    A* is {{faster}{speed}@0} than Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm\nSource (“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“A* Search Algorithm.” 2022.

It\u0026rsquo;s too easy to conclude that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to work hard \u0026ndash; only smart. This is the pitfall.\nThoughts I feel seen by this years-old blog post and it\u0026rsquo;s unpleasant. Particularly:\n An overinflated sense of your own abilities creates a constant state of production deficit, because you assume that you can make it up with a burst of brilliance and/or crunch.\n That\u0026rsquo;s been me for years now. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful to see it written out.\nNotes  If my coworkers were grinding through stuff that took them 20 hours, I\u0026rsquo;d be all \u0026ldquo;I work smart, not hard\u0026rdquo; with accompanying snarky eye roll, and I\u0026rsquo;d assume I could bust through an equivalent work load in four hours and still look like a goddamn superhero.\nAnd sometimes I could, so, hey, validation!\nAnd you can skate by like this (God knows I did) for a long time before a couple things eventually rear their heads and bite you in your entitled face.\n Productivity deficit: Your attitude writing checks your work ethic can\u0026rsquo;t cash  An overinflated sense of your own abilities creates a constant state of production deficit, because you assume that you can make it up with a burst of brilliance and/or crunch.\nBut there is no countering surplus to offset the deficit. The only way surpluses show up is when you finish a (presumably) hard task much faster than you anticipated. But instead of banking the surplus (i.e. moving on immediately to your next task), you spend it relaxing and screwing off because, whew, you just earned a small vacation by busting shit out in an hour that you thought would take all day. Hey, what\u0026rsquo;s on Facebook and Twitter right now? Do I have any new mail? No? I wonder if anyone has tweeted something recently since the last time I checked\u0026hellip;what about Reddit? Oh, an inspirational/funny/cool YouTube video, it\u0026rsquo;s only eight minutes long, let me watch it now! (Eight minutes later) Sweet\u0026hellip;what\u0026rsquo;s up Twitter? Oh man, I have to make a snarky response, but first I have to Google for that XKCD comic that totally makes my point for me\u0026hellip;\nAnd before you know it, the day is done, and you\u0026rsquo;re still feeling good because you finished in one hour what should have taken all day, so all good, right?\n Trap of the easy task  And yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s often all good, but when operating at a slight deficit things can go pear shaped quickly when you accidentally spring the trap of the easy task. Tasks so trivial that they barely register as work. Update an SDK? Hour, tops. Implement this feature that I\u0026rsquo;ve already done on every other platform? Hour, tops. [\u0026hellip;]\nIn other words, an easy task like this is so easy that it\u0026rsquo;s a constant time cost for everyone irrespective of ability, so there\u0026rsquo;s no opportunity nor need for crazy overestimation since what could possibly go wrong?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo what should have taken less than an hour took a week.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like having a perfect monetary budget that assumes no crazy \u0026ldquo;one time\u0026rdquo; only bills, except life is full of crazy one time only bills and the only way you can keep those under control is by giving yourself a budgetary capacitor to dampen the fluctuations.\nAnd now you\u0026rsquo;re defensive about losing a week to something stupid because you budgeted an hour for it and waited until the last second to do it and now the schedule has gone to hell, but it\u0026rsquo;s not your fault, because it could have happened to anyone! But if you had banked your surplus hours before and/or worked at closer to your theoretical peak effectiveness then this type of thing would get absorbed in the wash.\nAnd now you live in a state of mild panic because you\u0026rsquo;re way smarter than all this but you\u0026rsquo;re never actually getting things done on time.\n Identity recalibration crisis  Which leads to a potential identity recalibration crisis upon landing at a company with high performers that work hard and smart. And that will happen if you\u0026rsquo;re good. Now you\u0026rsquo;re no longer at the top of the curve. In fact, shit, you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle or bottom of the curve, a situation your brain probably never considered as an option.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSometimes it takes a while for this to sink in. Sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sink in at all, and you\u0026rsquo;re let go because you\u0026rsquo;re not very productive compared to your new team of high performers. Sometimes it sinks in, and you panic and get depressed because your self-image has always been that of being the strongest swimmer in the school, and right now you\u0026rsquo;re just trying not to drown, much less keep up with everyone else.\nBut ideally you shrug off the old counter productive mentality and habits and emerge as another one of the high functioning team members, but that can take a lot of work, particularly if you have to get over years of giving it twenty percent.\n Killing the underachiever  If my pithy advice were little more than \u0026ldquo;Be more like John Carmack\u0026rdquo; then I can imagine a lot of readers throwing up their hands and saying \u0026ldquo;Well, fuck it, I\u0026rsquo;m a lost cause, because that\u0026rsquo;s not going to happen.\u0026rdquo; But what I can do is relate some of the things that helped me kill off some of my underachieving habits. The point isn\u0026rsquo;t to become a superstar, it\u0026rsquo;s to become better [Get good], since that\u0026rsquo;s always the first step.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe in mechanical solutions (\u0026ldquo;Turn off the internet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Listen to music\u0026rdquo;, and stuff like that) because I don\u0026rsquo;t think they address the core issues, which are psychological. Instead I found that I had to do the following.\n I disagree with the author\u0026rsquo;s assessment that solutions such as \u0026ldquo;turning off the internet\u0026rdquo; are ineffective. This reads similarly to me as saying that someone should recover without crutches. Crutches are useful and important. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to say it\u0026rsquo;s a binary in which you can\u0026rsquo;t do both \u0026ndash; you can and you should. Embrace crutches and strive to build mental resilience, Grit, the capacity for Deep work, etc.\n   Develop self-awareness\nIt took working with John Carmack and other high productivity programmers and admitting that they were way more productive than me before I really understood how much more productive I could be. In other words, if you don\u0026rsquo;t admit it\u0026rsquo;s something worth improving, then obviously you\u0026rsquo;re not going to search for a solution, and if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, you should go here or here.\n  Give a shit\nOriginally I called this \u0026ldquo;develop a sense of urgency\u0026rdquo;, but really it\u0026rsquo;s just about caring about getting your work done. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter what you specifically care about! It can be your professional image, your product, your team, your customers, whatever. You just have to care about something that will drive you to getting things done, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t, apathy will occupy that void.\n  Minimize uncertainty\nIn another blog article, Productivity vs. Uncertainty and Apathy, I talk about how poorly defined goals can lead to poor productivity. If it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what you need to get done today, then there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable chance you won\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything today.\n  Commit to getting something done every day\nWhen you show up in the morning have a well defined set of things to finish that day. Stay as late as you have to in order to finish. By committing to finishing that task other distractions will naturally fall by the wayside. For example, I have jiu-jitsu training at 7pm. If I screw off too much during the day, I don\u0026rsquo;t get to train. Also, by committing to a task, you avoid \u0026ldquo;being busy\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;getting work done\u0026rdquo;, they\u0026rsquo;re not the same thing.\n  Never say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll finish it up tomorrow\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll make up for it by coming in early/staying late/working the weekend\u0026rdquo;\nThis is an easy trap to get into, where you keep incurring time debt until at some point you realize you\u0026rsquo;re now three weeks behind on a task that should have taken two days. This is like racking up credit card bills assuming you can pay them off later. Which is fine, until \u0026ldquo;later\u0026rdquo; arrives and you\u0026rsquo;ve only accumulated more debt.\n  Do not overpromise to make up for poor productivity\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a tendency when we\u0026rsquo;re falling behind to try to overcompensate with future promises. \u0026ldquo;When I\u0026rsquo;m done, it\u0026rsquo;ll be AWESOME\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m late, but I\u0026rsquo;m positive I\u0026rsquo;ll be done by Monday\u0026rdquo;. By doing those things we just build more debt we can\u0026rsquo;t pay off, and that will eventually lead to a catastrophic melt down when the super final absolutely last deadline date shows up. Just get shit done, don\u0026rsquo;t talk about how you\u0026rsquo;re going to get shit done.\n  Have an objective productivity metric\nThis is a mechanical thing, but it acts as a reasonable backstop. If you have changelogs you can reference, then it\u0026rsquo;s easy to sit down on Friday and ask yourself \u0026ldquo;What have I done this week?\u0026rdquo; And if you know that it\u0026rsquo;s possible for others to check on you, then it makes you take each day a lot more seriously. If you judge your value solely on output, not subjective things like \u0026ldquo;being smart\u0026rdquo;, you will be more productive.\n  Accept that \u0026ldquo;the grind\u0026rdquo; is part of the job\nA friend of mine\u0026rsquo;s father has a great quote: \u0026ldquo;Son, i don\u0026rsquo;t wake up every day and go to a place called fun.

Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant\u0026rsquo;s body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people\u0026rsquo;s limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:[7][2]\nA group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: \u0026ldquo;We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable\u0026rdquo;. So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, \u0026ldquo;This being is like a thick snake\u0026rdquo;. For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, \u0026ldquo;is a wall\u0026rdquo;. Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.\n In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant\u0026rsquo;s body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.[4][7]\nThe parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and fallacies; broadly, the parable implies that one\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation. In this respect, it provides an easily understood and practical example that illustrates ontologic reasoning. That is, simply put, what things exist, what is their true nature, and how can their relations to each other be accurately categorized? For example, is the elephant\u0026rsquo;s trunk a snake, or its legs trees, just because they share some similarities with those? Or is that just a misapprehension that differs from an underlying reality? And how should human beings treat each other as they strive to understand better (anger, respect, tolerance or intolerance)?\n(“Blind Men and an Elephant” 2022)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 313.16 2024-05-04T20:18:39Z   back 2.95 6 139.05 2023-08-10T19:10:19Z    Blind men and an elephant\nBack Humans tend to:\n claim absolute truth based on limited, subjective, experience ignore other people\u0026rsquo;s limited, subjective, experiences which may be equally true  Source (“Blind Men and an Elephant” 2022)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 6 144.24 2023-08-09T19:19:15Z    Tell the parable of the Blind men and an elephant\nBack A group of blind men who have never come across an elephant come across one.

They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other.","title":"Blind men and an elephant"},{"content":" The section sign, §, is a typographical character for referencing individually numbered sections of a document; it is frequently used when citing sections of a legal code.\n(“Section Sign” 2022)\n Flashcards Denotes    position ease box interval due     0 2.95 6 140.59 2023-07-24T07:02:20Z   1 2.95 6 138.52 2023-07-26T15:26:38Z    {{Section sign}@0}\n {{§}@1}  Source (“Section Sign” 2022)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Section Sign.” 2022.

But it\u0026rsquo;s like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you\u0026rsquo;re making stuff, what you\u0026rsquo;re making isn\u0026rsquo;t so good. It\u0026rsquo;s not that great. It\u0026rsquo;s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that good.\nBut your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you\u0026rsquo;re making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.\nEverybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.\nAnd if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you\u0026rsquo;re going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you\u0026rsquo;re going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you\u0026rsquo;re making will be as good as your ambitions.\nI took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met. It takes awhile. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna take you a while. It\u0026rsquo;s normal to take a while.

This recyclable waste can come from numerous places the most prevalent being from the trimming process where layers of leather hard clay are trimmed away from the pots that fill up the wheel tray with thin coils of clay. As they\u0026rsquo;re so thin, and disintegrate really easily, I immediately just chuck them into the reclaim bucket that lives next to my wheel and anytime my tray gets full I simply just dump them straight into it. Anything thicker than these turnings say a larger chunk of leather hard clay \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll never throw that directly into the reclaimed bucket if it\u0026rsquo;s still slightly wet as it\u0026rsquo;ll take weeks to degrade to a point where it can be recycled nicely so, instead, I\u0026rsquo;ll let it turn completely bone dry before placing it into this bucket. I also add things like the slops left over from my throwing water and when all these trimmings and other bits of waste are soaked overnight it\u0026rsquo;ll slake down into a fine slurry.\nWhenever I\u0026rsquo;m throwing pots if I need to remove the slip off my hands I do so against this sharp edge of a bucket filled with water. Then at the end of the day once I\u0026rsquo;ve finished throwing all my pots I\u0026rsquo;ll sponge down the wheel and then I\u0026rsquo;ll clean all of my tools and I\u0026rsquo;ll ring out the sponge in that same bucket of water. Even though I have a clay trap under the sink in my studio I still wash all of my tools and sponges and towels and things in this bucket of water first. I also don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily worry about cleaning every tool perfectly as, under normal circumstances, I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to use them in the next few days. I\u0026rsquo;ll lay out all of these wash tools on a cloth to dry overnight and at the same time all the clay will settle in a layer at the bottom.\nThe following morning I then carefully pour away the water trying my very best not to disturb the settled clay in the bottom. I swirl together what\u0026rsquo;s left and then this once again is added to my reclaim bucket.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAgain after a week or maybe two of throwing and trimming the bucket usually gets full. I then use a large sponge to remove as much excess water from the top as possible \u0026ndash; which I ring out in my other bucket of water that will eventually get added back to this. I then drag the bucket over to my plaster bats (which are made from a mixture of 80 potters plaster and 20 casting plaster, for strength). I place these plaster bats onto three kiln props so air can get beneath them and help dry them out.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re heavy thick bats that\u0026rsquo;ll absorb a lot of water from the clay that\u0026rsquo;s placed onto it, yet, they can still quickly become saturated and from time to time when they\u0026rsquo;re not in use I\u0026rsquo;ll either take them outside to sit in the sun or I\u0026rsquo;ll place them underneath my gas kiln when I\u0026rsquo;m firing it. I used to prop them up with wooden slats but they quickly become very moldy whereas these kiln props can\u0026rsquo;t. They\u0026rsquo;re also given a scrub clean every now and then to dislodge any loose plaster that might find its way into your clay body which you definitely want to try and avoid as small specks of plaster lodged in clay once fired can cause the clay and glaze above it to shear off, which is something potters called lime popping [Lime popping], so if you do recycle your clay like this and you find a little hard bead of white in your clay it\u0026rsquo;s best to remove it.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Florian Gadsby. 2022. “How I Recycle My Stoneware Pottery Reclaim.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmosgAAiiok.

Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.\nMastery learning methods suggest that the focus of instruction should be the time required for different students to learn the same material and achieve the same level of mastery. This is very much in contrast with classic models of teaching that focus more on differences in students' ability and where all students are given approximately the same amount of time to learn and the same set of instructions.\nIn mastery learning, there is a shift in responsibilities, so that the students' failure is considered to be more due to the instruction and not necessarily their lack of ability. This also means teachers' attention to individual students is emphasised as opposed to assessing group performance. Therefore, in a mastery learning environment, the challenge becomes providing enough time and employing instructional strategies so that all students can achieve the same level of learning.\nSince its conception, mastery learning has empirically been demonstrated to be effective in improving education outcomes in a variety of settings. Its effectiveness is influenced by the subject being taught, whether testing is designed locally or nationally, course pace and the amount of feedback provided to students.\n(“Mastery Learning” 2022)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 272.52 2024-03-19T03:41:42Z   back 2.50 7 196.19 2023-11-23T19:45:49Z    Mastery learning\nBack \u0026hellip; maintains that students must achieve a level of competance (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information.

One of the worst things you can do is blow your 5 tries within a day or two. You can think of the \u0026lsquo;forgetting curve\u0026rsquo; [Forgetting curve] as being like a chart of a radioactive half-life: each review bumps your memory up in strength 50% of the chart, say, but review doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much in the early days because the memory simply hasn\u0026rsquo;t decayed much! [\u0026hellip;]\nA graphical representation of the forgetting curve:\n  Even better, it\u0026rsquo;s known that active recall is a far superior method of learning than simply passively being exposed to information.⁠6 Spacing also scales to huge quantities of information; [\u0026hellip;]\n If you\u0026rsquo;re go good, why aren\u0026rsquo;t you rich?  Of course, [cramming] is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can\u0026rsquo;t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I\u0026rsquo;m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠\nBecause it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠12⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! [\u0026hellip;]\nAcross experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing\u0026hellip;.When they do consider spacing, they often exhibit the illusion that massed study is more effective than spaced study, even when the reverse is true (⁠Dunlosky \u0026amp; Nelson, 1994 (a)⁠; Kornell \u0026amp; Bjork, 2008a; ⁠Simon \u0026amp; Bjork2001 (a)⁠; Zechmeister \u0026amp; Shaughnessy, 1980 (a)).\nAs one would expect if the testing and spacing effects are real things, students who naturally test themselves and study well in advance of exams tend to have higher GPAs.⁠ If we interpret questions as tests, we are not surprised to see that 1-on-1 tutoring works dramatically better (a) [Bloom\u0026rsquo;s 2 sigma problem] than regular teaching and that tutored students answer orders of magnitude more questions⁠⁠.\nThis short-term perspective is not a good thing in the long term, of course. Knowledge builds on knowledge; one is not learning independent bits of trivia [Andy Matuschak | Knowledge Work Should Accrete]. Richard Hamming recalls in \u0026ldquo;You and Your Research\u0026rdquo;:\nYou observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs⁠. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest⁠.\u0026rdquo; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode\u0026rsquo;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.\n This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant \u0026amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near \u0026amp; vivid. (See hyperbolic discounting (a)⁠.)\n Literature review Review summary  To bring it all together with the gist:\n  testing is effective and comes with minimal ⁠negative factors (a)\n  expanding spacing is roughly as good as or better than (wide) fixed intervals, but expanding is more convenient and the default\n  testing (and hence spacing) is best on intellectual, highly factual, verbal domains, but may still work in many low-level domains\n  the research favors questions which force the user to use their memory as much as possible; in descending order of preference:\n free recall short answers multiple-choice Cloze deletion recognition    the research literature is comprehensive and most questions have been answered - somewhere.\n  the most common mistakes with spaced repetition are\n formulating poor questions and answers assuming it will help you learn, as opposed to maintain and preserve what one already learned⁠^{54} (a)⁠. (It\u0026rsquo;s hard to learn from cards, but if you have learned something, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to then devise a set of flashcards that will test your weak points.)     Using it How much to add  [\u0026hellip;] That\u0026rsquo;s our key rule of thumb that lets us decide what to learn and what to forget: if, over your lifetime, you will spend more than 5 minutes looking something up or will lose more than 5 minutes as a result of not knowing something, then it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to memorize it with spaced repetition. 5 minutes is the line that divides trivia from useful data.⁠ (There might seem to be thousands of flashcards that meet the 5 minute rule. That\u0026rsquo;s fine. Spaced repetition can accommodate dozens of thousands of cards. [\u0026hellip;])\n The workload  On average, when I\u0026rsquo;m studying a new topic, I\u0026rsquo;ll add 3-20 questions a day. Combined with my particular memory, I usually review about 90 or 100 items a day (out of the total \u0026gt;18,300). This takes under 20 minutes, which is not too bad.\n When to review  When should one review? In the morning? In the evening? Any old time? The studies demonstrating the spacing effect do not control or vary the time of day, so in one sense, the answer is: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter - if it did matter, there would be considerable variance in how effective the effect is based on when a particular study had its subjects do their reviews.\nSo one reviews at whatever time is convenient. Convenience makes one more likely to stick with it, and sticking with it overpowers any temporary improvement.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Branwen, Gwern. 2009. “Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning,” March. https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition.

Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe solution to this is two-fold - learn to take breaks before being completely drained, so I can resist the default and take rejuvenating actions. And lower the activation energy of rejuvenating actions, to shape the default - making them as close to the default as possible.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been deliberately vague about exactly what to do, I expect this to vary a lot between people - I recommend brainstorming the things that you feel rejuvenated after doing and building a system such that doing those is the default. But, if it helps, this was my process:\nWhen brainstorming what rejuvenated me, I found that being outside, away from screens, and doing something that felt pleasant and virtuous was the best source of rejuvenation per unit time. And an easy way to do this was to go lie down in my garden for 10 minutes and read a physical book (which also meant I began to actually work my way through my to-read list!). And actually doing this initially had high activation energy - I needed to get up to walk to the garden, there was less of a dopamine rush than checking messages, etc. So, for a week, I made a policy of always doing this during breaks and ensured I stuck to it - locking my phone and blocking distracting websites during breaks, having brief pings at the start and end. And I shaped my environment to make it easier, making sure to always have my current book close to hand. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly stick to this, and it took some energy to do. But making it a habit significantly lowered the activation energy, and built positive associations with it, to the point that it now feels way easier. And I don\u0026rsquo;t stick to it religiously, but it\u0026rsquo;s now much easier to do when I feel tired.\n(Nanda n.d.-a)\n Flashcards See Meaningful rest References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Nanda, Neel. n.d.-a. “Meaningful Rest.” Accessed May 23, 2021. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iYR9hKzTKGhZwTPWK/meaningful-rest. ———. n.d.-b. “Post 29: Meaningful Rest.” Neel Nanda.

There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \u0026ldquo;Morning, boys. How\u0026rsquo;s the water?\u0026rdquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \u0026ldquo;What the hell is water?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you\u0026rsquo;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don\u0026rsquo;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.\nOf course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education\u0026rsquo;s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about \u0026ldquo;teaching you how to think.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re like me as a student, you\u0026rsquo;ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to get in a place like this isn\u0026rsquo;t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I\u0026rsquo;d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: \u0026ldquo;Look, it\u0026rsquo;s not like I don\u0026rsquo;t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I haven\u0026rsquo;t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out \u0026lsquo;Oh, God, if there is a God, I\u0026rsquo;m lost in this blizzard, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna die if you don\u0026rsquo;t help me.'\u0026rdquo; And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. \u0026ldquo;Well then you must believe now,\u0026rdquo; he says, \u0026ldquo;After all, here you are, alive.\u0026rdquo; The atheist just rolls his eyes. \u0026ldquo;No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people\u0026rsquo;s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy\u0026rsquo;s interpretation is true and the other guy\u0026rsquo;s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person\u0026rsquo;s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there\u0026rsquo;s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They\u0026rsquo;re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists\u0026rsquo; problem is exactly the same as the story\u0026rsquo;s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know he\u0026rsquo;s locked up.\nThe point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.\nHere is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it\u0026rsquo;s so socially repulsive. But it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t worry that I\u0026rsquo;m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being \u0026ldquo;well-adjusted\u0026rdquo;, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.\nGiven the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education–least in my own case–is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about \u0026ldquo;the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.\u0026rdquo;\nThis, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.\nAnd I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let\u0026rsquo;s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what \u0026ldquo;day in day out\u0026rdquo; really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about.\nBy way of example, let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you\u0026rsquo;re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there\u0026rsquo;s no food at home. You haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It\u0026rsquo;s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it\u0026rsquo;s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can\u0026rsquo;t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store\u0026rsquo;s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough check-out lanes open even though it\u0026rsquo;s the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can\u0026rsquo;t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.\nBut anyway, you finally get to the checkout line\u0026rsquo;s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to \u0026ldquo;Have a nice day\u0026rdquo; in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.\nEveryone here has done this, of course. But it hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year.\nBut it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don\u0026rsquo;t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.\nOr, of course, if I\u0026rsquo;m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV\u0026rsquo;s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] — this is an example of how NOT to think, though — most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children\u0026rsquo;s children will despise us for wasting all the future\u0026rsquo;s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.\nYou get the idea.\nIf I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It\u0026rsquo;s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I\u0026rsquo;m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world\u0026rsquo;s priorities.\nThe thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible that some of these people in SUV\u0026rsquo;s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he\u0026rsquo;s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he\u0026rsquo;s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.\nOr I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket\u0026rsquo;s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.\nAgain, please don\u0026rsquo;t think that I\u0026rsquo;m giving you moral advice, or that I\u0026rsquo;m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it\u0026rsquo;s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do it, or you just flat out won\u0026rsquo;t want to.\nBut most days, if you\u0026rsquo;re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s not usually like this. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you\u0026rsquo;re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won\u0026rsquo;t consider possibilities that aren\u0026rsquo;t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\nNot that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that\u0026rsquo;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you\u0026rsquo;re gonna try to see it.\nThis, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. You get to decide what to worship.\nBecause here\u0026rsquo;s something else that\u0026rsquo;s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It\u0026rsquo;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It\u0026rsquo;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.\nWorship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they\u0026rsquo;re evil or sinful, it\u0026rsquo;s that they\u0026rsquo;re unconscious. They are default settings.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nAnd the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving…. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\nThat is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.\nI know that this stuff probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don\u0026rsquo;t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.\nThe capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.\nIt is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:\n\u0026ldquo;This is water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is water.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.\nI wish you way more than luck.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}David Foster Wallace. n.d. “This Is Water.” Accessed November 23, 2022. https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/.

Thus, pyrometric cones give a temperature equivalent; they are not simple temperature-measuring devices.","title":"Pyrometric cone"},{"content":"Gwern Branwen, (Branwen 2018)\nSummary Thoughts Notes  Any product is the joint outcome of a large number of individual components, each of which layers is necessary but not sufficient to the final valuable use of the entire stack put together; a smartphone is not much good without a power-efficient sensitive radio, but the radio is not much good without a good OS on top of it, and a good OS is not much good either without great apps like web browsers (and is a web browser all that useful if there aren\u0026rsquo;t useful websites to use in it, and where are the languages \u0026amp; compilers for all this coming from anyway…?).\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Another way that I like to express that is \u0026ldquo;create a desert of profitability around you\u0026rdquo;. I once had a strategy professor define the Google business model somewhat like that, where \u0026ldquo;Google tries to make every other business around it free or irrelevant\u0026rdquo;…A desert of profitability shifts consumers to you, and keeps competitors away.\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Vertical integration can be an effective way of resolving the intractable market dispute with top-down dictatorships, but can require lax anti-monopoly regulations, high capital investment, massive corporation overextension \u0026amp; empire-building, and risks being outcompeted at every level by nimbler competitors; this makes it difficult for any up-and-coming company to implement, and often ineffective. Commoditizing the complements, in contrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small \u0026amp; lean, can often be accomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual property or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific layers without the \u0026ldquo;Big Bang\u0026rdquo; orientation of vertical integration and permitting \u0026ldquo;defeat in detail\u0026rdquo;, retains the general facade of competition, and ensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack where the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but is not itself at any risk.\nIn practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market dynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging competitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits \u0026amp; software patent trolling, proprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate incompatibility or \u0026ldquo;embrace and extend\u0026rdquo;, FUD, operating at a loss indefinitely, etc. (\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s An App For That\u0026rdquo; is why you buy an iPhone—but it\u0026rsquo;s Apple with the $930 billion market cap \u0026amp; not the app developers.)\nDone correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents' long-term control of markets \u0026amp; justifies their enormous valuations—by definition, the competitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too numerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening R\u0026amp;D4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be relatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor does this require convoluted explanations like \u0026ldquo;they are pretending to not be monopolists\u0026rdquo; or fully general unfalsifiable claims like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s good PR\u0026rdquo; for why big companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects like new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts \u0026amp; TrueType itself) or open source TCP/​IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly profitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable—but do have clear explanations in terms of business objectives like \u0026ldquo;driving more mobile web browsing\u0026rdquo; (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement, mobile web browsing, has become cheaper/​easier). I wonder if this also explains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes—as entities get worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but was formerly considered \u0026lsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; or because they assume the other entity knows something they don\u0026rsquo;t. (Google cared little about an also-ran code-hosting site like GitLab other than some VC investment—well, right up until Microsoft outbid it for Github \u0026amp; Github became free for individual developers \u0026amp; acquired NPM⁠, and then suddenly GitLab becomes a unicorn with even more VC from Google \u0026amp; others.)\n(Branwen 2018)\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Branwen, Gwern. 2018. “Laws of Tech: Commoditize Your Complement,” March. https://www.gwern.net/Complement.

Striving to adopt a schedule that significantly reduces the amount of sleep per 24 hours and/or fragments sleep into multiple episodes throughout the 24-hour day is not recommended.\n Thoughts Their findings align with my experience.\nNotes Abstract  Polyphasic sleep is the practice of distributing multiple short sleep episodes across the 24-hour day rather than having one major and possibly a minor (\u0026ldquo;nap\u0026rdquo;) sleep episode each day. While the prevalence of polyphasic sleep is unknown, anecdotal reports suggest attempts to follow this practice are common, particularly among young adults. Polyphasic-sleep advocates claim to thrive on as little as 2 hours of total sleep per day. However, significant concerns have been raised that polyphasic sleep schedules can result in health and safety consequences. We reviewed the literature to identify the impact of polyphasic sleep schedules (excluding nap or siesta schedules) on health, safety, and performance outcomes. Of 40,672 potentially relevant publications, with 2,023 selected for full-text review, 22 relevant papers were retained. We found no evidence supporting benefits from following polyphasic sleep schedules. Based on the current evidence, the consensus opinion is that polyphasic sleep schedules, and the sleep deficiency inherent in those schedules, are associated with a variety of adverse physical health, mental health, and performance outcomes. Striving to adopt a schedule that significantly reduces the amount of sleep per 24 hours and/or fragments sleep into multiple episodes throughout the 24-hour day is not recommended.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Weaver, Matthew D., Tracey L.

Striving to adopt a schedule that significantly reduces the amount of sleep per 24 hours and/or fragments sleep into multiple episodes throughout the 24-hour day is not recommended.\n Thoughts Their findings align with my experience.","title":"Matthew D.

Mental models can help shape behaviour and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.\n(“Mental Model” 2022)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.","title":"Mental model"},{"content":" Geometry (from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría) \u0026lsquo;land measurement\u0026rsquo;; from γῆ (gê) \u0026lsquo;earth, land\u0026rsquo;, and μέτρον (métron) \u0026lsquo;a measure\u0026rsquo;) is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics.

Looking at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not be worth it.\n Notes  There\u0026rsquo;s a well-known quote by author Michael Pollan: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. I like it because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get you 90% of the way there 90% of the time.\n Write code Not too much  Just be aware of your project\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;appetite\u0026rdquo;: write what needs to be written, and then try not to over-indulge.\n Mostly functions  By \u0026ldquo;functions\u0026rdquo; here I mean \u0026ldquo;Pure functions\u0026rdquo;. You could make a case that pure functions aren\u0026rsquo;t the \u0026ldquo;plants\u0026rdquo; of code, though I feel that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly always a win for the long-term health of the project.\nOf course the qualifier is \u0026ldquo;mostly\u0026rdquo;: this isn\u0026rsquo;t a dogma. Writing a 100% functional system (\u0026ldquo;going vegan\u0026rdquo;, if you will) often requires you to jump through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not be worth it.\nAnd then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or performance-sensitivity. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.\n \u0026ldquo;Real code\u0026rdquo;  Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:\n\u0026ldquo;He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother\u0026rsquo;s generation would have recognized as food.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is \u0026ldquo;code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what they do\u0026rdquo;. Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too clever, \u0026ldquo;manufacturing artificial ingredients\u0026rdquo;. Use the primitives that are there, when possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Smith, Brandon. n.d. “Write Code. Not Too Much.

The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself.","title":"Greatness is a transitory experience"},{"content":" Seek freedom and become captive of your desires.

He builds his cabin, gathers around him a few other families of similar tastes and habits, and occupies till the range is somewhat subdued, and hunting a little precarious, or, which is more frequently the case, till the neighbors crowd around, roads, bridges, and fields annoy him, and he lacks elbow room. The preëmption law enables him to dispose of his cabin and cornfield to the next class of emigrants; and, to employ his own figures, he \u0026ldquo;breaks for the high timber,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;clears out for the New Purchase,\u0026rdquo; or migrates to Arkansas or Texas, to work the same process over…. [T]he real Eldorado is still farther on.\nA similar pattern can be seen in the open source community. There has been, for instance, a consistent migratory pattern from Ruby to node.js to Go, Rust, and Elixir. At first, each community is defined by its potential. But as that potential is realized, the community begins to be defined by its compromises. That change is felt most keenly by the people who were there first, who remember what it was like when anything seemed possible. They feel fenced in and so they move on, in search of their golden city.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nFor some people, creating widely used software is highly rewarding, and the administrative responsibilities it introduces are a small price to pay.

Legibility as faceted: Complements our own experience; allows us to apply it where we see fit  Thoughts This dichotomy reminds me of Unix philosophy; Composability versus monolithic design.\nNotes  In Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; [Legibility] as something a state imposes on its people and resources. It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.\nOne of Scott\u0026rsquo;s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests. These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.\nAnd so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps. A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand. If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it. Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.\nIn The Image of the City, Kevin Lynch defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it. It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.\nLynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they\u0026rsquo;d navigate from one part of the city to another. He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.\n   In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software. [Not in Emacs!]\nThis is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s continuous attempts to resurrect logical positivism (a). Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles. As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.\nScott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they\u0026rsquo;re mostly process-oriented (\u0026ldquo;take small steps\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;favor reversibility\u0026rdquo;) and entirely focused on harm reduction. For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.\n   The legibility described in Seeing Like a State, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is singular; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator. The legibility described in Image of the City, and offered by Marco Polo, is faceted; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.\nCreating singular legibility is simple: find something that\u0026rsquo;s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it. What\u0026rsquo;s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you\u0026rsquo;d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.\nFaceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively. It\u0026rsquo;s not, however, something we can simply create on our own. Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.\nBut if you, like me, are interested in software, there are no readymade references.5 I believe, however, that the answer lies in articulation points:\n  As we compose our abstractions, we must ensure we create, at regular intervals, interfaces which fully separate our upstream and downstream components. These interfaces not only delineate subgraphs which can be understood in isolation [Black boxes], they represent decision points in our design process. From any given articulation point, we can branch off in a dozen different directions, perhaps even all at once. These are separate interpretations of what the interface represents, each of which can be considered or ignored in isolation.\nThis is more easily said than done. Countless decisions go into every bit of software, but not all of them deserve to be enshrined as an interface. Once used, interfaces ossify. They allow the code on either side to drift apart, to lose consistency in idiom and purpose. If we don\u0026rsquo;t expect an interface to require multiple interpretations, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist. To make the right decision, we must predict the future.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Two Concepts of Legibility.” Accessed November 11, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/two-concepts-of-legibility.html.

Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object\u0026rsquo;s velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \u0026ldquo;instantaneous rate of change\u0026rdquo;, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe process of finding a derivative is called differentiation [Differentiation].

In a large skillet, heat a glug of oil or veggie broth over medium. When the pan is hot, add the garlic and sauté until it becomes fragrant. This will take about a minute. Add the mushrooms, tamari, and thyme. Cook, stirring every minute or so, for 6 to 8 minutes or until the mushrooms release their water and a little broth starts to form. Combine the cashews and veggie broth in a high-speed blender and blend until the mixture is completely smooth. This might take up to 5 minutes, depending on the speed and power of your blender. Pour the cashew sauce into the pan with the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for a couple minutes to let the sauce thicken, stirring frequently. Throw in the spinach and stir for another minute. Prepare the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Make sure to do this after your mushroom sauce is ready to go, so the noodles don\u0026rsquo;t sit for too long and start sticking together. Spread a third of the marinara sauce on the bottom of an 8-by-11-inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles. Cover the noodles with half of the mushroom cream. Add a layer of noodles. Use another third of the marinara to cover these noodles. Add the remaining mushroom cream. Add the last layer of noodles and cover it with the remaining marinara sauce. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, add a sprinkle of nutritional yeast over the top, if you like, and bake for another 15 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Murnane, Jessica. 2017.

Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation. A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need. A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the problem and its solution.  (“Agile Software Development” 2022)\n   The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:\n Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months). Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location). Working software is the primary measure of progress. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

The first mile is packed with wastewater. This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives.\nBecause your pipe has only one faucet, there\u0026rsquo;s no shortcut to achieving clarity other than first emptying the wastewater.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s apply this to creativity: At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that unavoidably comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting them, recognize bad ideas as progress. Bad ideas are usually the clichés your brain has been overexposed to.\nOnce the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my guess as to why: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve generated enough bad output, your mind reflexively identifies which elements caused the badness. Then it becomes good at avoiding them. You start pattern-matching interesting ideas with greater intuition.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to look at something bad then intuit how to make it better than to make something good out of thin air.\nMost creators resist their bad ideas and never reach the clear water. If you\u0026rsquo;ve opened a blank document, scribbled a few thoughts, then walked away because you weren\u0026rsquo;t struck with gold, then you too never got past it.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYour work starts as a weak imitation.

In other words, \u0026ldquo;your third place is where you relax in public, where you encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances.\u0026rdquo;\nOther scholars have summarized Oldenburg\u0026rsquo;s view of a third place with eight characteristics:\n  Neutral ground\nOccupants of third places have little to no obligation to be there. They are not tied down to the area financially, politically, legally, or otherwise and are free to come and go as they please.\n  Leveler (a leveling place)\nThird places put no importance on an individual\u0026rsquo;s status in a society. One\u0026rsquo;s socioeconomic status does not matter in a third place, allowing for a sense of commonality among its occupants. There are no prerequisites or requirements that would prevent acceptance or participation in the third place.\n  Conversation is the main activity\nPlayful and happy conversation is the main focus of activity in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of conversation is usually light-hearted and humorous; wit and good-natured playfulness are highly valued.\n  Accessibility and accommodation\nThird places must be open and readily accessible to those who occupy them. They must also be accommodating, meaning they provide for the wants of their inhabitants, and all occupants feel their needs have been fulfilled.\n  The regulars\nThird places harbor a number of regulars that help give the space its tone, and help set the mood and characteristics of the area. Regulars to third places also attract newcomers, and are there to help someone new to the space feel welcome and accommodated.\n  A low profile\nThird places are characteristically wholesome. The inside of a third place is without extravagance or grandiosity, and has a homely feel. Third places are never snobby or pretentious, and are accepting of all types of individuals, from various different walks of life.\n  The mood is playful\nThe tone of conversation in third places is never marked with tension or hostility. Instead, third places have a playful nature, where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common, but highly valued.\n  A home away from home\nOccupants of third places will often have the same feelings of warmth, possession, and belonging as they would in their own homes. They feel a piece of themselves is rooted in the space, and gain spiritual regeneration by spending time there.\n  (“Third Place” 2022)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 314.05 2024-04-11T02:19:55Z   back 2.65 3 6.00 2023-07-29T03:49:03Z    Third place\nBack A place for people to gather which is distinct from home and the workplace.\nSource (“Third Place” 2022)\nExample(s)    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 319.93 2024-05-10T15:43:21Z   back 2.95 6 151.48 2023-08-07T06:08:26Z    Third place\nBack  Barbershops Libraries Parks Coffee shops  Source References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Third Place.” 2022.

Human evolution has primarily occurred in small hunter-gatherer groups, as opposed to in larger and more recently settled agricultural societies or civilizations. With a negative connotation and in a political context, tribalism can also mean discriminatory behavior or attitudes towards out-groups, based on in-group loyalty.\n(“Tribalism” 2022)\n   Tribalism or Coalitional Instincts is closely connected to the concept of in/out-groups. Coalitional instincts drive humans to act in ways which cause them join, support, defend, and maintain their membership in various coalitions that are defined by sharing a common identity.\n(Lesswrong n.d.)\n   Every human—not excepting scientists—bears the whole stamp of the human condition. This includes evolved neural programs specialized for navigating the world of coalitions—teams, not groups. (Although the concept of coalitional instincts has emerged over recent decades, there is no mutually-agreed-upon term for this concept yet.) These programs enable us and induce us to form, maintain, join, support, recognize, defend, defect from, factionalize, exploit, resist, subordinate, distrust, dislike, oppose, and attack coalitions. Coalitions are sets of individuals interpreted by their members and/or by others as sharing a common abstract identity (including propensities to act as a unit, to defend joint interests, and to have shared mental states and other properties of a single human agent, such as status and prerogatives).\nWhy do we see the world this way? Most species do not and cannot. Even those that have linear hierarchies do not. Among elephant seals, for example, an alpha can reproductively exclude other males, even though beta and gamma are physically capable of beating alpha—if only they could cognitively coordinate. The fitness payoff is enormous for solving the thorny array of cognitive and motivational computational problems inherent in acting in groups: Two can beat one, three can beat two, and so on, propelling an arms race of numbers, effective mobilization, coordination, and cohesion.\nAncestrally, evolving the neural code to crack these problems supercharged the ability to successfully compete for access to reproductively limiting resources. Fatefully, we are descended solely from those better equipped with coalitional instincts. In this new world, power shifted from solitary alphas to the effectively coordinated down-alphabet, giving rise to a new, larger landscape of political threat and opportunity: rival groups or factions expanding at your expense or shrinking as a result of your dominance.\n(Tooby n.d.)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.20 7 196.73 2023-11-16T15:14:23Z   back 2.50 7 222.74 2023-12-22T10:23:54Z    Tribalism\nBack Discriminatory behavior or attitudes towards out-groups based on in-group loyalty\nSource (“Tribalism” 2022)\nAKA    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 340.45 2024-06-28T14:44:29Z   1 2.20 6 83.28 2023-08-05T21:40:17Z     {{Tribalism}@0} {{Coalitional instincts}@1}  Source (Lesswrong n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Lesswrong. n.d. “Tribalism.” Accessed January 14, 2023. https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/tribalism.

Apple did not attain this compatibility through Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cooperation: it attained it despite Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s noncooperation. Apple didn\u0026rsquo;t just make an \u0026ldquo;interoperable\u0026rdquo; product that worked with an existing product in the market: they made an adversarially interoperable product whose compatibility was wrested from the incumbent, through diligent reverse-engineering and reimplementation. What\u0026rsquo;s more, Apple committed to maintaining that interoperability, even though Microsoft continued to update its products in ways that temporarily undermined the ability of Apple customers to exchange documents with Microsoft customers, paying engineers to unbreak everything that Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s maneuvers broke. Apple\u0026rsquo;s persistence paid off: over time, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s customers became dependent on compatibility with Apple customers, and they would complain if Microsoft changed its Office products in ways that broke their cross-platform workflow.\nSince Pages' launch, document interoperability has stabilized, with multiple parties entering the market, including Google\u0026rsquo;s cloud-based Docs offerings, and the free/open alternatives from LibreOffice. The convergence on this standard was not undertaken with the blessing of the dominant player: rather, it came about despite Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s opposition. Docs are not just interoperable, they\u0026rsquo;re adversarially interoperable: each has its own file format, but each can read Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s file format.\n(Doctorow 2019a)\n Flashcards Definition    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 380.53 2024-07-04T09:02:17Z   back 2.80 7 266.73 2024-02-17T07:59:56Z    Adversarial interoperability\nBack Interoperability achieved without the permission or support of, and sometimes in spite of resistance on the part of, the makers of the original thing.\nSource (Doctorow 2019b)\nExample(s)    position ease box interval due     front 3.10 7 465.80 2024-10-07T12:13:03Z   back 2.80 7 302.25 2024-03-12T23:22:13Z    Adversarial interoperability\nBack  Apple\u0026rsquo;s office suite recognizing Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Word/etc file formats  Source (Doctorow 2019a)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Doctorow, Cory. 2019a. “Adversarial Interoperability: Reviving an Elegant Weapon From a More Civilized Age to Slay Today’s Monopolies.” Electronic Frontier Foundation. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay. ———. 2019b. “Adversarial Interoperability.” Electronic Frontier Foundation. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability.

The stag hunt problem originated with philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on Inequality. In Rousseau\u0026rsquo;s telling, two hunters must decide separately, and without the other knowing, whether to hunt a stag or a hare. However, both hunters know the only way to successfully hunt a stag is with the other\u0026rsquo;s help. One hunter can catch a hare alone with less effort and less time, but it is worth far less than a stag and has much less meat. Rousseau therefore posits it would be much better for each hunter, acting individually, to give up total autonomy and minimal risk, which brings only the small reward of the hare. Instead, each hunter should separately choose the more ambitious and far more rewarding goal of getting the stag, thereby giving up some autonomy in exchange for the other hunter\u0026rsquo;s cooperation and added might.\n(“Stag Hunt” 2022)\n See also: Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma.\nExamples  Social cooperation; international agreements regarding climate change  Flashcards Example(s)    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 3 6.00 2022-12-09T19:56:23Z   1 2.5 -1 0 2022-09-30T21:36:06Z    {{Stag hunt}@0} (Game theory)\n {{Social cooperation; international agreements regarding climate change}@1}  Source (“Stag Hunt” 2022)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 7 162.01 2023-10-07T23:03:45Z   back 2.20 7 127.21 2023-08-16T21:19:46Z    Stag hunt\nBack  Players can gain more through cooperation than they can on their own Sometimes involves deciding whether or not to cooperate with Imperfect information  Source (“Stag Hunt” 2022)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Stag Hunt.” 2022.

Discard the water covering the dough and fill the bowl again with cool, clean water. As the new water fills the bowl, begin stretching and kneading the dough. Keeping your hands and dough in the bowl of water, continue kneading and stretching until the water becomes very opaque.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Dump out your milky water, using a colander to catch the dough ball and any stray pieces\n   Cover your dough ball again, this time using luke-warm water, and continue to stretch and knead until the water becomes opaque again. Alternating cool and warm water affects how the dough breaks apart and comes back together again. The goal of this is to hopefully lessen the amount of times you need to wash. However, you can do all cool water and get the same result. It is not recommended to use water that is too warm or hot, because your dough can become stickier or more gluey and harder to work with.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Repeat steps 3 and 4\n   (Le 2021)\n   You will likely need to repeat this process at least few times. You will see the dough begin to look more stringy and feel a little \u0026ldquo;squeaky\u0026rdquo; between your fingers. The more starch you wash out, the more chewy your seitan will become, so the end result is up to you.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWash until the water is at least a little bit cloudy.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Once you have finished washing to your desired level of water clarity, let the dough rest in the colander for at least 20 minutes\n This is to both drain the excess water and let the strands begin to develop. If you are adding additional spices or proteins, proceed to step [7]. If you are not, you should let it rest even longer until the gluten becomes very elastic and you are able to stretch it far without it breaking.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   (optional) Add in seasonings\n A good rule of thumb if adding proteins or liquids is to only add about 2oz to this size dough ball so your seitan does not become too soft. I prefer just adding in dry spices to keep the texture chewier, but you can also add liquids such as soy sauce or liquid smoke to boost flavor, and/or additional proteins such as tofu or beans to soften the texture of your final result and also make your seitan a complete protein. My preferred method for incorporating them is to use a food processor, but you can also cut them into the dough or knead them in by hand. Then you will need to let the dough rest again until it starts to come back together and become more elastic and stretchy. You want it strong enough to knot, even if you do not intend to cook it that way. This usually takes about 20 minutes, but can take up to an hour or so depending on what you\u0026rsquo;ve added. You can also leave it sit overnight so the gluten continues to develop, but that is unnecessary.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Prepare Seitan for cooking\nStretch and knot (braid) the Seitan dough.\n   (Le 2021)\n   Cook Seitan\nBring enough broth to cover Seitan to a simmer in a pot, then add the Seitan and cook for 2+ hours (depending on the thickness of the dough).\n  Let it rest in the fridge for at least 8 hours\n While you can skip this step, the texture will not have had a chance to completely firm up.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Flashcards Describe the steps to make Wash the flour seitan    position ease box interval due     front 2.05 7 172.74 2023-10-20T12:35:20Z     Combine flour and water Cover dough ball with water and let rest for \\(1\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;8\\) hours Wash flour repeatedly until you achieve desired water clarity Add seasonings Let rest for \\(\u0026gt;1\\) hour(s) Braid the dough Simmer dough in broth Let dough rest for \\(\u0026gt;8\\) hours  Source Wash the flour method\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Le, Lisa. 2021. “Washed Flour Seitan Method.” The Viet Vegan. https://thevietvegan.com/washed-flour-seitan-method/.

It\u0026rsquo;s okay to sacrifice (a) minorities in order to win. This applies to more than just racism and is termed the cost of doing business.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] controversy = attention and attention = brand recognition. [\u0026hellip;] [The] economy runs on engagement, and hate-clicks are still clicks.\n   This is privilege. Indeed, this is part of what makes privilege privilege: it\u0026rsquo;s the identity that\u0026rsquo;s treated as a norm. The one you don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about.\n   The Alt-Right is the gentrification of white nationalism. Their pocket squares and MBAs and $90 haircuts short out the white moderate\u0026rsquo;s brain because they still associate white supremacy with white trash.\n   The boundaries are not policed from the inside.\n   Now, these people frequently are self-identified, card-carrying racists. My point is, for this system of incentives and rewards to operate, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Any of them may, but none of them must. Racism exists and it\u0026rsquo;s efficient. And, in a capitalist society, where cops are competing for promotions, private prisons are competing for contracts, and politicians are competing for votes, if an unethical behavior sees a higher return than the alternative… then ethics are a luxury. There are hundreds of examples of businesses that claim, in periods of prosperity, that they prefer to do what is right over what is profitable. But what tune do they play when prosperity ends? Every boom has a bust - since 1900, the US has spent one out of every four years in recession. And, in the lean season, not using this generations-old system built by white people to advantage their descendents is a liability. A values-based business typically goes one of three ways: compromising their values to stay competitive, getting bought by someone who compromised their values to stay competitive, or sticking to their guns and facing a higher risk of going out of business. Many choose to do the right thing, and some even survive. But that\u0026rsquo;s beating the odds. The market trends toward the optimal strategy.\n See also:\n Specifically: Moloch and This is the dreamtime Generally: Systems   [\u0026hellip;] white supremacy is about power.\n   Because, I mean, what if they genuinely believe the Voting Rights Act unfairly targets Southern states? Or even if - and I\u0026rsquo;m saying if here - they did do it to suppress votes, if hurting Black people isn\u0026rsquo;t their goal, and they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to win elections, is that really \u0026ldquo;racist?\u0026rdquo;\nModerates are very cagey about breaking out the R-word for a fellow white person.\nSee, there\u0026rsquo;s this other definition of racism that most white people learn in grade school: racism is when you say mean things to other kids about skin color and it hurts their feelings; racism is about cruelty. And harm done by white people, therefore, isn\u0026rsquo;t racism if isn\u0026rsquo;t cruel; it\u0026rsquo;s merely ignorant. Or apathetic. But ignorance and apathy can be reasoned with; you just gotta sit down and hash it out. As long as it takes. Real white supremacy is about emotional distress or interpersonal violence; it\u0026rsquo;s uncommon, it\u0026rsquo;s unpopular, and it\u0026rsquo;s a hearts and minds issue.\nWhat this definition leaves out is any notion that white supremacy is about power. That white people who disavow racism still live longer, get paid better, get arrested less often, and are typically in position to negotiate with whomever\u0026rsquo;s in power. That this society was built for The Everyman, and being The Everyman confers power upon you.\nWhen children of white moderates get older and first brush up against this definition, wherein white supremacy is not small but all-encompassing, where it can be cruel, but is at least as often indifferent, and where every white person in the country is bound up in it and privileged by it whether they want to be or not, and will never, ever experience it themselves - where it\u0026rsquo;s not about feelings but power - how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition I grew up with was simplified for 9-year-olds\u0026rdquo;?; or, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition given to me by white grown-ups was less complete than the one a Black grown-up might\u0026rsquo;ve given\u0026rdquo;? And how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t just redefine racism?\u0026rdquo;\nRight out the gate, the white moderate is possessive not just of their whiteness but of the very definition of racism.\nIn the definition they know, racism exists only over here. And the white collaborator is a compatriot who shares their ultimate vision for the future, but has simply gone off course somewhere. And they don\u0026rsquo;t see themselves as flawed individuals with a long way still to go; they\u0026rsquo;ve already arrived! They\u0026rsquo;re the destination everyone else needs to get to! Living proof that white supremacy can be easily and painlessly opted out of. They can\u0026rsquo;t see collaborators as opponents because there is no definition of white supremacy that includes collaborators and doesn\u0026rsquo;t also include them.\nAnd this is critically important: they don\u0026rsquo;t want to start thinking of themselves as white. They don\u0026rsquo;t want the constant awareness of one\u0026rsquo;s race or how one\u0026rsquo;s race is perceived – you know, the things the rest of humanity deals with. And who would want that? I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who wants that: Nazis and klansmen want that. They\u0026rsquo;re the only ones who like thinking about whiteness every day. So, white moderates cling to the other definition, the comfortable one. They may be more or less willing to collaborate with people of color, but mostly in ways that don\u0026rsquo;t foreground their whiteness. White-as-default is one concession that can never be made, in part because it\u0026rsquo;s the one that can\u0026rsquo;t be spoken.\n   Racism must be understood as more than a set of individual beliefs and feelings, but as a tool for achieving political ends, first and foremost because claiming otherwise is both factually and morally wrong.

In the context of journalism, a sound bite is characterized by a short phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what the speaker was trying to say, and is used to summarize information and entice the reader or viewer. The term was coined by the U.S. media in the 1970s. Since then, politicians have increasingly employed sound bites to summarize their positions.\nDue to its brevity, the sound bite often overshadows the broader context in which it was spoken, and can be misleading or inaccurate.

The determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants (the preceding property is a corollary of this one).","title":"Determinant"},{"content":" The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used set of clear code words for communicating the letters of the English alphabet, technically a radiotelephonic spelling alphabet.\n(“NATO Phonetic Alphabet” 2022)\n    Character Telephony     A Alfa   B Bravo   C Charlie   D Delta   E Foxtrot   F Golf   G Hotel   H India   J Juliett   K Kilo   L Lima   M Mike   N November   O Oscar   P Papa   Q Quebec   R Romeo   S Sierra   T Tango   U Uniform   V Victor   W Whiskey   X X-ray   Y Yankee   Z Zulu    Flashcards (NATO phonetic alphabet) A: {{Alfa}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.20 7 221.29 2023-09-22T00:35:08Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) B: {{Bravo}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 297.20 2023-12-26T20:05:06Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) C: {{Charlie}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 285.04 2024-03-01T13:52:34Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) D : {{Delta}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 257.74 2023-11-09T21:30:07Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) E: {{Echo}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 197.16 2023-07-28T19:02:32Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) F: {{Foxtrot}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.90 6 50.41 2023-08-30T22:57:34Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) G: {{Golf}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 9 248.73 2023-09-12T08:24:19Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) H: {{Hotel}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.20 7 180.29 2023-11-07T22:04:00Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) I: {{India}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 10 296.47 2024-01-27T03:54:13Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) J: {{Juliett}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.90 6 35.27 2023-08-23T20:16:06Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) K: {{Kilo}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.55 7 34.61 2023-08-16T03:24:54Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) L: {{Lima}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 301.94 2023-11-23T15:25:59Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) M: {{Mike}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.85 8 118.89 2023-08-08T13:51:20Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) N: {{November}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 8 356.10 2024-03-23T00:03:13Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) O: {{Oscar}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 261.46 2023-10-14T03:59:56Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) P: {{Papa}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.90 6 46.93 2023-08-26T13:51:23Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) Q: {{Quebec}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 342.46 2024-05-02T01:08:29Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) R: {{Romeo}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.30 10 31.77 2023-07-26T07:47:30Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) S: {{Sierra}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 414.47 2024-08-04T01:23:21Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) T: {{Tango}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.75 9 136.86 2023-10-26T13:53:45Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) U: {{Uniform}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.45 9 111.33 2023-11-04T21:51:10Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) V: {{Victor}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 217.40 2023-09-01T00:43:01Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) W: {{Whiskey}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.30 8 20.07 2023-08-03T02:26:43Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) X: {{X-ray}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.75 8 73.56 2023-09-07T07:00:36Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) Y: {{Yankee}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 9 414.72 2024-08-25T17:35:17Z    (NATO phonetic alphabet) Z: {{Zulu}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 6 103.35 2023-08-20T01:34:52Z    References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“NATO Phonetic Alphabet.” 2022.

The B-tree generalizes the Binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. Unlike other Self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\n   ((Programiz n.d.))\n Each internal node of a B-tree contains a number of keys. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) [(e.g. \\(30\\) and \\(33\\) in the image above)]. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than \\(a_1\\), all values in the middle subtree will be between \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than \\(a_2\\).\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\n Properties For a given B-tree of order \\(m\\):\n Each Vertex has at most \\(m\\) children The root has at least two children unless it\u0026rsquo;s a leaf Internal (non-leaf) Vertices store:  Pointers to child Vertices Keys which indicate the bounds of the elements in the leaves below.   Internal Vertices have between \\(\\lceil m/2 \\rceil\\) and \\(m\\) children Internal Vertices with \\(k\\) children have \\(k - 1\\) keys Leaf Vertices store data Leaf Vertices are all on the same level  Operations Lookup  Lookup in a B-tree is straightforward. Given a node to start from, we use a simple linear or binary search to find whether the desired element is in the node, or if not, which child pointer to follow from the current node.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n Time complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nInsertion  Insertion and deletion from a B-tree are more complicated; in fact, they are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. For insertion, we first find the appropriate leaf node into which the inserted element falls (assuming it is not already in the tree). If there is already room in the node, the new element can be inserted simply. Otherwise the current leaf is already full and must be split into two leaves, one of which acquires the new element. The parent is then updated to contain a new key and child pointer. If the parent is already full, the process ripples upwards, eventually possibly reaching the root. If the root is split into two, then a new root is created with just two children, increasing the height of the tree by one.\nFor example, here is the effect of a series of insertions. The first insertion (13) merely affects a leaf. The second insertion (14) overflows the leaf and adds a key to an internal node. The third insertion propagates all the way to the root.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n       ((“B-Trees” n.d.))\n  ((“Insertion into a B-tree” n.d.))\nTime complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nDeletion  Deletion works in the opposite way: the element is removed from the leaf. If the leaf becomes empty, a key is removed from the parent node. If that breaks invariant 3, the keys of the parent node and its immediate right (or left) sibling are reapportioned among them so that invariant 3 is satisfied. If this is not possible, the parent node can be combined with that sibling, removing a key another level up in the tree and possible causing a ripple all the way to the root. If the root has just two children, and they are combined, then the root is deleted and the new combined node becomes the root of the tree, reducing the height of the tree by one.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n Time complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nFlashcards {{Inner Vertices}@0} in B-trees of order \\(m\\) have {{between \\(\\lceil \\frac{m}{2} \\rceil\\) and \\(m\\)}@1} children    position ease box interval due     0 1.75 8 117.05 2023-08-12T17:12:58Z   1 1.30 8 21.80 2023-08-10T08:56:47Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\n{{Vertices}@0} in B-trees with \\(k\\) children have {{\\(k-1\\)}@1} keys    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 7 145.75 2023-08-13T10:18:14Z   1 2.05 7 148.07 2023-08-31T18:08:47Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nB-tree {{leaf Vertices}@0} are {{all on the same level}{level}@1}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 353.47 2024-05-01T03:38:34Z   1 2.95 7 474.40 2024-10-16T06:34:30Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nThe root Vertex of a B-tree has {{\\(\\ge 2\\)}@0} children unless {{it\u0026rsquo;s a leaf}@1}    position ease box interval due     0 2.20 7 131.90 2023-08-16T18:19:01Z   1 2.35 7 190.18 2023-11-16T20:20:40Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nB-tree {{internal Vertices}@2} store {{keys}@0} and {{pointers to child Vertices}@1}    position ease box interval due     2 2.50 7 277.43 2024-02-13T01:20:31Z   0 2.65 7 284.87 2024-03-12T22:01:54Z   1 2.65 7 309.73 2024-05-02T08:57:45Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nB-tree {{leaf}@0} Vertices store {{data}@1}    position ease box interval due     0 3.10 7 454.13 2024-10-06T18:41:40Z   1 2.80 7 317.21 2024-04-18T19:44:15Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nImage    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 262.91 2023-12-17T01:08:07Z   back 2.80 7 326.21 2024-04-15T01:18:17Z    B-tree\nBack   Source (Programiz n.d.)\nB-trees are {{self-balancing}{balance}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 7 248.51 2024-01-10T05:39:00Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\n{{B-trees}@0} generalize {{Binary search tree}@1}    position ease box interval due     0 3.10 7 473.36 2024-09-10T23:19:20Z   1 2.20 7 160.42 2023-08-31T02:17:28Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nTime complexity for B-tree insert: {{\\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.50 7 339.97 2024-05-07T00:43:20Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nTime complexity for B-tree delete: {{\\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 7 258.08 2024-01-27T16:46:13Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nTime complexity for B-tree lookup: {{\\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 7 384.86 2024-05-31T12:37:41Z    Source (“B-Tree” 2022)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“B-Tree.” 2022.

Each Vertex stores an extra bit representing \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;black\u0026rdquo;), used to ensure that the Tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.\nWhen the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged [Tree rotation] and \u0026ldquo;repainted\u0026rdquo; to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.

The purpose of the media spin is to provide a narrative for liberals to latch on to which explains why the United States is doing bad things, engaging with bad people, etc.\n Nima: The lie is that Biden is meeting with an enemy. He\u0026rsquo;s not.\n Notes  Adam: Right. So every three, four years, five years, the President of the United States, going back to since before I was born, they visit Saudi Arabia and they codify a long existing geopolitical relationship in the Middle East. Namely, a few things which we\u0026rsquo;ll go over, which is the US support of Saudi\u0026rsquo;s bombing in Yemen, which is seen as a quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;counter measure\u0026rdquo; against quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;expansionist\u0026rdquo; Iran. That\u0026rsquo;s how they view it. They support, everyone reduces this to oil, and oil is a part of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s much more than that.\n   Adam: In the 17th and 18th century, whenever a royal needed to get a divorce because they hated their wife or they wanted a younger wife or the wife more likely couldn\u0026rsquo;t breed them a male heir, they would have some council of priests come up with, almost always say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re cousins, this is a violation of a taboo against marriage because they\u0026rsquo;re all cousins,\u0026rsquo; right? So this is sort of similar to that where there\u0026rsquo;s this clergy class of reporters who needed to explain why the fist bump was not bad but because, my favorite was Peter Baker — who is the biggest fucking hack in the world — who\u0026rsquo;s a foreign policy for The New York Times wrote, quote, \u0026ldquo;As soon as Biden got out of the car and saw MBS waiting, he immediately put his fist out making clear it would not be a handshake.\u0026rdquo; This is followed by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard who said, quote, \u0026ldquo;A chilly fist bump with M.B.S. welcomes Biden.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Right.\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly,\u0026rdquo; see Adam.\nAdam: A \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nNima: They\u0026rsquo;re not friends, it was a \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nAdam: Right. And so then you get into this whole thing where everyone\u0026rsquo;s debating whether or not this, you know, about the fist bump, the optics, you know, cozying up to dictators, human rights, that\u0026rsquo;s all bullshit.\nNima: As if the decades long relationship, which is clear as fucking day, is not the actual story here.\nAdam: Right and so the fist bump becomes a distraction in a sense, right? It becomes a way of, then the crime is not the selling of the $650 million in arms.\nNima: Right. Then we\u0026rsquo;re just reading fucking tea leaves instead of talking about the real issue.\nAdam: Right. And so the big crime really should be the month-long Washington Post investigation, that came out on June 4 of this year, detailing how despite the fact that Biden claimed he was going to end the war in Yemen to much fanfare when he first came in office — obviously, on this show, we said that\u0026rsquo;s probably bullshit, turns out total bullshit — the US has been continuing to support the Saudi bombing of Yemen to this day since Biden\u0026rsquo;s office. So the crime is not that we\u0026rsquo;re supporting their war on Yemen or supporting the blockade of Yemen, although we sort of speak in platitudes about ceasefires and lifting blockades. Fundamentally, they\u0026rsquo;re still giving intelligence support, replacing parts, et cetera. Literally pointing to a map saying this is where you want to, you know, this is where the Houthi rebels are or whatever. The US obviously sells them hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons. None of that\u0026rsquo;s changed. Then there\u0026rsquo;s this whole narrative that, \u0026lsquo;Oh, he had to do it because of Ukraine.\u0026rsquo; There was a Bloomberg headline that read, \u0026ldquo;Soaring Oil Prices Forced Biden to Engage with Saudis He\u0026rsquo;d Spurned.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Again, remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not that Biden fundamentally as President of the United States is fine with the relationship with Saudi Arabia because it\u0026rsquo;s an absolutely critical relationship to what US foreign policy is and has been for decades. Biden does not have a problem with this. He is not hand wringing about this. He is not concerned with meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. This is not an issue and yet our media needs it to be this twisted, tough decision to make.\nAdam: So from June 3, 2020, \u0026ldquo;Biden forced into Saudi thaw amid rising oil prices.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Meeting with Crown Prince would cement U-turn for a US president who labeled kingdom a \u0026lsquo;pariah.'\u0026rdquo; Financial Times — not a U turn at all. Fundamentally, policy never changed.\nNima: Right. Labeling a pariah but doing nothing to create pariah status is not actually making a pariah.\n   Adam: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;The president\u0026rsquo;s Middle East reset raises human rights concerns for some fellow Democrats. Others are prepared to get pragmatic.\u0026rdquo; So —\nNima: Oh, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s a really good one.\nAdam: Pragmatic.\nNima: Human rights concerns: niche issue. Pragmatism: reality.\n   Adam: So every single time we do this we get the same hand wringing concerns and part of me is just kind of frustrated by this because I\u0026rsquo;m like, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this theater? What\u0026rsquo;s the point at this point, in the year of our Lord, Ken Roth has been the head of Human Rights Watch for going on, you know, 35 years or going on 30 years now, right? You\u0026rsquo;d think after Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, Biden all did the exact same trip, they greenlit the exact same weapons deals, they have soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia who then left but then sort of came back. You have the US selling every single Gulf despot from Kuwait to UAE to Saudi Arabia the same spy technology so they can spy on dissidents and lock them up. You have these very cozy business relationships between Saudi Arabia funds Vice media, UAE funds CNN, you would think after these decades of relationships that this is not something that deviates from quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;abandoning principles,\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s actually the principle itself and that once you shred that pretense, again, what replaces it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, might makes right nihilism or kind of Kissinger view of the world about power1, it should be okay, well, what would a government that actually cares about human rights both negative and positive, right? Not just freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, but freedom from poverty, freedom for education, freedom for housing.\nAdam: Right. What would that regime look like and is that something we could maybe pressure our government to do or fight for? The sort of classic critique of this arrangement is that allied states, the United States and allied states, are viewed as being, when they commit human rights violations, it\u0026rsquo;s seen as a deviation whereas when human rights are committed by enemy states, they\u0026rsquo;re existential to who they are.\nNima: Right. Fundamental to what those states are all about. They only understand power, they don\u0026rsquo;t care about their people, that\u0026rsquo;s all the stuff that we\u0026rsquo;ve that about on the show like about what these kinds of countries elsewhere deemed to be official US state enemies. They are fundamentally bad and we are fundamentally good.\nAdam: Right and we just deviate. Yeah, we need a mild talking to, we need a mild chiding. And so a very infamous version of this was in January of 2015 when King Abdullah died, this is again this sort of worst of the worst human rights violators, this is before the war in Yemen started but we\u0026rsquo;re talking, you know, women can\u0026rsquo;t drive, chopping up dissenters, mass beheadings, oppressive Shia religious intolerance, blah, blah, blah, you name it, they got it, a lot of connections to al Qaeda, which we\u0026rsquo;ll table for another episode. Yeah, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Saudi Arabia: King\u0026rsquo;s Reform Agenda Unfulfilled,\u0026rdquo; and the article said, quote:\nKing Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s reign brought about marginal advances for women but failed to secure the fundamental rights of Saudi citizens to free expression, association, and assembly. Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s successor, King Salman, should halt persecution of peaceful dissidents and religious minorities…\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, his reform agenda was unfulfilled, right? And contrast this with Hugo Chavez who died about 21 months prior, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Venezuela: Chavez\u0026rsquo;s Authoritarian Legacy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Dramatic Concentration of Power and Open Disregard for Basic Human Rights.\u0026rdquo; Throughout the obituary of Chavez he\u0026rsquo;s seen as existential to the regime as human rights abuses whereas Saudi Arabia remains, even though of course, they commit hundreds and hundreds of more human rights abuses than Chavez ever did, Saudi Arabia is seen as having a reform, unironically, said to have a reform agenda, which was simply unfulfilled.\nNima: Reform agenda. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t get to be completed, because the noble reformist died. Oops.\nAdam: Yeah, their dog ate the reform agenda so they had to sort of write it again, it was a whole thing. I mean, this whole thing is so, you realize again, just after years and years and years of this kind of discourse how empty it is, how much it\u0026rsquo;s meant to sort of limit the conversation.\n[links and footnotes added]\n   Adam: Would any New York Times reporter without irony say that scholars of the Middle East claim that it\u0026rsquo;s best that Russia align with Iran and Syria? Because that\u0026rsquo;ll promote good behavior, dissuade, no, you would be laughed out of the room if you said that. But this goofy, childish bullshit that has absolutely no empirical basis, is based on a bunch of racist assumptions, that somehow the US is the human rights Boys and Girls Club, is going to be your mentor, it\u0026rsquo;s going to look after you, it\u0026rsquo;s just going to look after these otherwise kind of restless young countries, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to, we\u0026rsquo;re going to guide them to the right path? What the fuck is that? After school special? Saudi Arabia knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, we know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, they\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the same thing for decades, they serve a very specific function, and this idea that we\u0026rsquo;re going to change them from the inside. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the height of cynicism and Ben Hubbard is just a total fucking White House flunky, he\u0026rsquo;s a total national security state flunky, is going to just kind of seeing how many the sophistic little ratchet pellets he can shove in his article to so liberals can go, \u0026lsquo;Yeah, well, I guess he\u0026rsquo;s right, I guess we have no choice.\u0026rsquo; So all that hemming and hawing and huffing and puffing over Trump patting dictators on the back and going to Saudi Arabia and doing this, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026lsquo;I guess that this is somehow different than that.\u0026rsquo; Well, no, it\u0026rsquo;s not different. Oh, because he did it with a heavy fucking heart.\nNima: Well, because see, this goes back to that sophistry, right? This goes back to the fucking sophistry, Adam, which is Trump did it because he fundamentally agreed with them and he wanted to be like them and he was impressed by dictators, right? But Biden, Biden does it because he just, ah, it\u0026rsquo;s such a bummer, he\u0026rsquo;s so forced, he\u0026rsquo;s going to, he\u0026rsquo;s going to be forced to give a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump\u0026rdquo; as opposed to —\nAdam: Oh, a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Right. Here\u0026rsquo;s a chilly fist bump along with your $650 million worth of weapons.\n   Nima: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Cut Biden some slack. U.S. presidents have to deal with dictators.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the headline, and in it, Max Boot argues, of course, what you would think which is, you know, hey, this is the way Realpolitik is executed, why is everyone getting so up in arms about this? In the article he writes this, quote:\n\u0026ldquo;In truth, MBS is a more ambivalent figure than the cartoon villain that he is so often made out to be in media coverage. It\u0026rsquo;s true that he is cruel and repressive. He has created a climate of fear in Saudi Arabia, imprisoned dissidents and accumulated absolute power. But, while illiberal politically, he is liberalizing Saudi society.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Yeah, which he\u0026rsquo;s not, whatever, he\u0026rsquo;s been doing the same reform agenda for, you know, the 250 year Saudi Foreign reform agenda.\nNima: The long game.\nAdam: It\u0026rsquo;ll be ready when my great-great grandson.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. \u0026ldquo;Tourists are welcome for the first time,\u0026rdquo; he writes. \u0026ldquo;Theaters and concerts have been opened.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Oh, theaters and concerts. Okay.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right.\nAdam: Yeah. Lord knows that that\u0026rsquo;s the mark of a liberal democracy is bread and circuses that historically —\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. And meanwhile, The Washington Post is publishing this and Jamal Khashoggi, again, who was bone sawed alive by the MBS regime, by, you know, guys carrying this fucking shit out, that is the same outlet that is publishing this shit for Max Boot justifying it.\nAdam: Max Boot argues on Twitter that Nixon met with Mao Zedong, FDR met with Stalin blah, blah, blah, and it\u0026rsquo;s like, look, it\u0026rsquo;s true, I actually think that all the anger about the fist bump is a distraction. It\u0026rsquo;s not really the problem.\nNima: Right. The meeting is not the issue. That could be diplomacy. He\u0026rsquo;s not meeting MBS for diplomatic reasons.\nAdam: Right. He\u0026rsquo;s meeting with him to talk about increasing the weapons sales that we, the substance of the relationship is the problem, which is supporting and backing the subjugation of dissidents, the bombing of Yemeni, the oppression of women, I mean, you name it, right?

Backlinks  Upstream | Fully Automated Luxury Communism  ","title":"Upstream"},{"content":"Upstream, (Upstream 2022)\nSummary A discussion of Fully automated luxury communism.\nNotes  [Della Z Duncan]\nAnd so what about this term, Fully automated luxury communism communism? How might you introduce that to someone who\u0026rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, I would say essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization \u0026ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible \u0026ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what\u0026rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.\nI should also say it really pushes back on the image and stereotype of a sort of bleak drab, sort of breadline poverty that many people associate with the term communism and tries to reinvent that term, from a position of abundance. So fully automated luxury communism really emphasizes communism instead of capitalism to because capitalism has these internal mechanisms that prevent it from generating abundance, it really relies on scarcity. Moreover, in a world where human labor is largely valueless in the production process \u0026ndash; that is a world where robots can do it so much better \u0026ndash; wages no longer makes sense. So you just gain either an income or some version of access to material benefits without necessarily putting in working hours.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning and we can talk maybe more about this later, there\u0026rsquo;s actually a manifesto style book that explains the concept by Aaron Bastani, entitled [Aaron Bastani | Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto], published by verso in 2019. But those are the broad strokes of the term, I\u0026rsquo;d say.\n[formatting added]\n   [Della Z Duncan]\n[\u0026hellip;] Eric, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering what about you like you describe this sense of being in a grocery store and machine kind of delivering the goods on the on the shelves? What else might we see or feel in under fully automated luxury communism?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a great question. And I think like Mark Fisher, I also start with the questions of urbanism.\nI think urbanism is really important, it\u0026rsquo;s important to imagine our built environment operating under a different logic. So when I try to imagine a fully automated luxury communist world, the key thing I ponder is how our relationship to space and time would change. And something I really want to know is what cities would be like, again, if they were not oriented around work and consumerism. I mean, think about like how much of the street level experience is dominated by those things, and what it could be like if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThis is something that a friend of mine and collaborator, [unclear] Bria and I were working on and a project we were we had going last year called Imagining the Postwork City, where we invited artists and designers to submit visions of what postwork cities and an automated society could look like. And these are some of the prompts, which I think start to really answer the question.\nSo in terms of public space, you know what kinds of public spaces might exist in place of offices and factories and stores that currently dominate the landscapes of our downtown\u0026rsquo;s and central districts? What facilities and attractions might exist to occupy the time that\u0026rsquo;s freed from work? How might people interact with the forms and functions of the city and determine its uses? In terms of housing? What kinds of dwellings would people have in such a world? Would people even continue to have homes and the traditional sort of fixed sense? Or might they just drift, either from fixed place to fixed place, or else become part of a sort of urban hunter gatherer society, just eating, sleeping, playing wherever you happen to be at the time entirely in public spaces, never really claiming these as your own? Or perhaps we would always be on vacation and just follow some around the world? Who knows? This also leads into questions about the sort of regional distribution of the population would you know, if you\u0026rsquo;re not, if you\u0026rsquo;re no longer working, then you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be somewhere based on economic opportunity, that being the key driver of both migration and settlement patterns throughout history. So who knows? Maybe everyone would live in tropical regions, or maybe people who live in the types of regions that make them happy.\nThis begs questions of whether certain regions would perhaps depopulate and others would grow because they\u0026rsquo;re just more conducive to human happiness. Would existing cities dissipate as people became free of the economic tethers that keep them there? Would everyone become rural? I like to think we would continue to value cities but for new and better reasons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s infrastructural questions, what kinds of transit might we have, how we get around? How would goods be distributed? I mean, this vision of the grocery store that\u0026rsquo;s just sort of roboticized? Isn\u0026rsquo;t an interesting one. Would it continue to be a grocery store? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if you\u0026rsquo;d need walls around it anymore because there\u0026rsquo;s no point in stealing in a world where all the things are available to you.\nLots of questions too to ask about how we spend our time. And there\u0026rsquo;s no more sort of distinct breakdown between like leisure time and work time, you\u0026rsquo;re kind of always being creative. You know, you\u0026rsquo;d have new kinds of divisions between space and maybe have spaces specifically for rest and other spaces specifically for healing or for thinking or for feeling good, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it becomes a really exciting design problem, really.\nAnd it was fun to see what these artists and designers came up with in response to these prompts. There were lots of visions of green spaces, multi layered urbanism, drawing inspiration from resorts, you know, seeing resorts, and currently like luxury and exclusive spaces almost as like prefigurative little aspects of what the whole world can be like.\n[formatting added]\n   [Zarinah Agnew]\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s one other thing I want to mention, which is, I think important, because I think when people think of communism, they think a lot of austerity and bleak equality, where everyone has access to the same things, but the things that they have access to a kind of rubbish. And I wanted to mention something from David Graeber, his most recent book, in which they reference indigenous and native forms of economics. And they talk about, you know, in these early forms of economic societies, people still had private ownership, they could have trinkets and objects and symbols, things that they use to denote the individualism, things that they gifted to others to sort of, say, thank you, and so on, and so forth. But crucially, the things that were privately owned, could not be turned into power over others. And the resources that were fundamental for collective survival, like land couldn\u0026rsquo;t be privately owned. And so I think what luxury communism points to is both the ability to make sure that everybody\u0026rsquo;s needs are met, and we have a good life. And also the sort of luxury and quality of being able to have our own aesthetic and our own ways of being and adorning our lives, I think is really important.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Upstream. 2022. “Fully Automated Luxury Communism.” https://soundcloud.com/upstreampodcast/fully-automated-luxury-communism.

This includes the cases of finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements. There are O(n)-time (worst-case linear time) selection algorithms, and sublinear performance is possible for structured data; in the extreme, O(1) for an array of sorted data.

A hash table uses a Hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.\nIdeally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n Collision resolution  A search algorithm that uses hashing consists of two parts. The first part is computing a hash function which transforms the search key into an array index. The ideal case is such that no two search keys hashes to the same array index. However, this is not always the case and is impossible to guarantee for unseen given data. Hence the second part of the algorithm is collision resolution. The two common methods for collision resolution are Separate chaining and Open addressing.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n Separate chaining  [\u0026hellip;] the process involves building a linked list with key–value pair for each search array index. The collided items are chained together through a single linked list, which can be traversed to access the item with a unique search key.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n   Open addressing  [\u0026hellip;] is another collision resolution technique in which every entry records are stored in the bucket array itself, and the hash resolution is performed through probing. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates an unsuccessful search.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n    Well-known probe sequences include:\n Linear probing, in which the interval between probes is fixed (usually 1). Quadratic probing, in which the interval between probes is increased by adding the successive outputs of a quadratic polynomial to the value given by the original hash computation. Double hashing, in which the interval between probes is computed by a secondary hash function.

The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype).

Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (\u0026ldquo;disorganized distress\u0026rdquo;), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.\n(“Attachment Theory” 2022)\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 9 374.58 2024-06-03T04:05:00Z   back 2.35 8 339.34 2024-04-24T21:05:03Z    Avoidant attachment\nBack An unhealthy attachment pattern in which the child \u0026ldquo;gives up\u0026rdquo; on receiving comfort from their guardian(s) and instead attempts to distance themselves emotionally; go it alone and become distrustful of interpersonal relationships.\nSource (“Attachment Theory” 2022)\nExample(s)    position ease box interval due     front 1.45 9 116.78 2023-11-16T22:26:42Z   back 2.05 7 158.87 2023-09-19T10:12:56Z    Avoidant attachment\nBack  A neglected or abused child seeking to distance themselves from their guardians.

Backlinks  Ian Danskin | I Hate Mondays  ","title":"He's not hurting the people he needs to be"},{"content":"Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2020)\nThis is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.\nSummary I hate mondays is an embrace of coping strategies and a refusal to address a problem stemming from the belief that the problem is unfixable.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] conservative thinks about people dying of preventable illnesses, school shootings, and back alley abortions the way you think about Mondays.\nThe conservative mindset tends to sort things into binaries with no room for scale. Mass shootings either happen or they don\u0026rsquo;t. You can talk about how much safer countries with robust gun control are, and they\u0026rsquo;ll just say, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s a shooting that happened in England. Here\u0026rsquo;s a shooting that happened in Australia. Gun control didn\u0026rsquo;t stop them. You can\u0026rsquo;t regulate evil.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the kind of sentence that can drive you up the wall, because it is, on its face, obviously true, but it\u0026rsquo;s only applicable in this context thanks to the word that\u0026rsquo;s implied but not stated: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t regulate all evil.\u0026rdquo; Yes, since they\u0026rsquo;ve had gun control, there have been shootings in England and Australia. Does it matter that these shootings are far less deadly and happen far less often? Does it matter that making guns harder to get has saved tens of thousands of lives? Like, do we really need to explain why stores put junk food you know you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy right next to the checkout counter? Because the easier it is to do a thing, the more it happens.\nThe mentality here is that, if you can\u0026rsquo;t stop every shooting, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother stopping any; if you can\u0026rsquo;t save every life, there\u0026rsquo;s no point improving healthcare. Nothing short of literally defeating death will be good enough.\nIt is a wholesale rejection of thinking in terms of systems. Notice how Payroll phrases his argument: \u0026ldquo;A bad person can always find a way to do bad things.\u0026rdquo; Person. Singular. If a criminal can still get a gun, they extrapolate that every criminal can get a gun, in the same way that, if a poor person can get a job, every poor person can get a job. Which, no. If there are fewer jobs than people who need them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be unemployment, and if there are fewer guns than people who want to shoot them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be less gun crime. If they talked about populations of people they\u0026rsquo;d have to acknowledge that some percentage succeeds at doing bad things and a percentage fails, and, since percentages are different across cultures, we must have some influence over them. But a binaristic model of \u0026ldquo;things either happen or they don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; leaves no room for percentages. Was there a shooting? Then there is still evil in the world.\nA conservative will generally agree with you about what the ills of society are: bigotry, violence, disease, oppression, poverty. But they don\u0026rsquo;t view them as problems to be solved. They are facts of life. Of course racism is terrible… but it\u0026rsquo;s a Monday. Trying to fight racism is like trying to fight the first law of motion. The only reason to even talk about it is to commiserate.\n   And, on its face, this seems completely contradictory to all the other things they claim to believe. Sometimes you wanna scream at Payroll, \u0026ldquo;How can you think regulating guns won\u0026rsquo;t reduce shootings but somehow regulating women will reduce abortions?!\u0026rdquo; But here\u0026rsquo;s the real kicker: he doesn\u0026rsquo;t. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t think illegalizing abortions will make them happen less. What he wants is to throw people in jail for getting them. It\u0026rsquo;s right there in how he talks about gun rights: \u0026ldquo;Why should I be punished for the crimes of a monster?\u0026rdquo; To him, the law isn\u0026rsquo;t about shaping society, it\u0026rsquo;s about who gets punished [He\u0026rsquo;s not hurting the people he needs to be].\n   In this view, human nature is immutable. People are going to… be gay and do crime, and get abortions, and take drugs, and the law is not there to guide, it is there to judge. It is there it sanctify one particular walk of life as The Right Way. The reason they\u0026rsquo;re opposed to contraceptives and sex ed is not because they don\u0026rsquo;t work, but because they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter that kids who get abstinence-only education have just as much sex than the ones who learn about condoms; acknowledging that teenagers have sex is saying it\u0026rsquo;s ok, and abstinence says it\u0026rsquo;s not. And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s because you\u0026rsquo;re just not trying hard enough! More abstinence! More abstinence!\n   Take, for example, the (often liberal) sentiment, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils.\u0026rdquo; There is no consequentialist argument for this. Perhaps if you and an organized bloc of citizens threatened to withhold your votes in order to influence policy, but, as a purely individual act, the consequentialist would argue your goal is to achieve the most ethical outcome. And that, if there are two evils, and one or the other is going to be in a position of power, voting for the lesser is more ethical than staying home. The consequentialist would argue you are just as responsible for the results of your inaction as for the actions you take. When both options are terrible, all you can do is mitigate the damage.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not generally the way it feels. It feels like refusing to participate, or choosing someone you want to win but whom you know isn\u0026rsquo;t going to, is the more ethical option. That voting for the lesser is a moral compromise. This feeling is independent of results. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mitigate damage, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce harm, but it does preserve your integrity [Ian Danskin | You Go High, We Go Low]. That feeling is very powerful; many politicians have staked their careers on it. Our society has always told us that voting for any flavor of evil will leave a stain on our souls; it continues to feel this way even among people who no longer believe in souls. The greatest difference between Left and Right is simply in how common and how intense this feeling is.\n   The necessary counternarrative is to stress that the problems we face are not natural features of the world, that, in fact, very little of human life is natural, and, even if it were, what is natural is not necessarily what is right. The way nature deals with a pandemic is to let everyone without a genetic resistance to the illness die, and, if what\u0026rsquo;s left is not a stable breeding population, you go extinct. That\u0026rsquo;s natural. Humanity as we know it only exists in defiance nature. Every form of bigotry, every means of oppression, is a thing we created; they are human problems, and they have human solutions. They have not always existed and there are places in the world where they are being addressed. The idea that the worst things on Earth have no great significance, that most evil is a chaotic mess borne of human fallibility, can be very depressing to consider; it can also be empowering.\nThis is a secular view. It can be reconciled with spirituality, but not with reactionary fundamentalism, which is the point. And it can be kind of baffling to have to assert that, when bad things happen, maybe we should do something about it? But you just can\u0026rsquo;t take for granted that, when someone agrees a thing is bad, they\u0026rsquo;re agreeing it\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\n Flashcards I hate mondays References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2020. “I Hate Mondays.” Tumblr.

And you conclude that, if you believe in democracy, you must believe in equality, and, if you believe in equality, you must believe in equal access to education, and must conclude that governments should help pay tuition. And so you give your friend the benefit of the doubt that, if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand this very simple logical progression, he either hasn\u0026rsquo;t had it properly explained to him, or has, at some point, been lied to. Because no one could believe in \u0026ldquo;all citizens are equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;always a bigger fish\u0026rdquo; at the same time.\nBut, by this thinking, you\u0026rsquo;re treating most conservatives as people who want, in their hearts, to be liberals, but have so far failed. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why they think liberals are condescending?\n   [\u0026hellip;] when a choice between [capitalism and democracy] has to be made, a liberal is someone who tends to think democratically, and a conservative is someone who tends to think like a capitalist.\nTHE OPERATIVE WORD HERE IS \u0026ldquo;TEND.\u0026rdquo; Liberals are still capitalists and conservatives still stan for democracy, and the preference for one or the other may be very slight. Nevertheless, which way a person leans reveals their priorities.\n   The democratic framework - or, at least, a democratic framework - is \u0026ldquo;one citizen, one vote.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are, you are born with certain in- or possibly unalienable rights, and any system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you those rights is a tyranny. Freedom, agency, and a hand in the strictures that govern you; everyone is entitled to these things. It\u0026rsquo;s an egalitarian mindset; people gain power by electoral process, i.e. when it is granted to them by the masses, with whom the true power resides, and whom the Constitution guarantees the right to take that power away from an electee. Rather than powerful, the elected official is, in a sense, an employee with millions of bosses, all of whom have equal authority. This is the idea of democracy, with the history of democracy being riddled with failures to live up to this ideal, but part of the project of liberalism has been about making the government more closely resemble its ideology.\n   The capitalist framework, by contrast, is that of businesses and markets, where \u0026ldquo;big fish eat the little ones.\u0026rdquo; If two people start businesses in the same field, and one makes more profit than the other, that person can make more investments, open more locations, undercut their competitor\u0026rsquo;s prices. The more money you have, the more money you can make. So advantage compounds, where even small failures often mean getting muscled out of the field. Now, with some creativity - a novel cost-saving practice or a new delivery method - the underdog can still thrive, and this is part of what conservatives like about the market: that it demands this creativity in a live-ammo environment. But most will not beat the odds; that\u0026rsquo;s how odds work. Since there will always be more failures than successes, the general trajectory of unregulated capitalism is money pooling into fewer and fewer hands. Things naturally sort themselves into a hierarchy with sharks at top, a million minnows at the bottom.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn conservative thinking, this hierarchy is humanity\u0026rsquo;s natural state. The American Dream is \u0026ldquo;here, anyone can make it.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are or what you start with, you can become a billionaire. But a necessary component of this is: anyone can, but everyone can\u0026rsquo;t. We\u0026rsquo;re not all gonna be billionaires, there\u0026rsquo;s a finite amount of money in this country. For any one person to have so, so, so much more than they need, there must - mathematically - be thousands of people with less. Your conservative friend is often baffled as to what you\u0026rsquo;re even trying to say when you point out there\u0026rsquo;s not enough high-paying jobs or affordable health plans for everyone; there\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be. The system requires an underclass. Someone\u0026rsquo;s gotta clean the toilets.\nCapitalism, then, is a proving ground. It\u0026rsquo;s how you demonstrate where in the hierarchy you deserve to be. Do you have more than you need, or less? Anything you\u0026rsquo;ve got, you beat someone else to it. How resourceful were you? How well did you play? The field is, by no means, level, but any disadvantage just means you have to work harder. We know people who start with nothing can win big; if you are a shark, you will make your way to the top, because that\u0026rsquo;s where you belong. Anyone complaining about how stacked the deck is against them is making excuses for not being better at the game.\nDisadvantage itself is not a problem, so long as it is (quote-unquote) \u0026ldquo;natural.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s necessary is that advantage and disadvantage not be imposed from without. Free tuition, a high minimum wage, taxes on the wealthy, or any other kind of government meddling, these things must be opposed, because, with them, people would end up in the wrong places. Power has to be earned; if it isn\u0026rsquo;t earned, it won\u0026rsquo;t be properly wielded, and then society ends up a mess. Conservatives generally feel what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the world today can be chalked up to people not being where they should be in the social order. They used to be where they belonged, but then liberals gummed everything up with their government handouts and forced representation. (When, exactly, things were the way they should be is a bit of a moving target: nowadays, they act like it was the 80\u0026rsquo;s, in the 80\u0026rsquo;s it was the 50\u0026rsquo;s, and in the 50\u0026rsquo;s it was some time before the New Deal. So, following the nostalgia cycle, it\u0026rsquo;s usually \u0026ldquo;about thirty years ago.\u0026quot;)\nConservatives are distrustful of any effort to make society more equal because, deep down, they don\u0026rsquo;t believe equal societies are real. Obviously, \u0026ldquo;all citizens created equal\u0026rdquo; needs to be the government\u0026rsquo;s position, because you can\u0026rsquo;t trust the government to know where to put people, so it has to treat everyone the same. But this is a legal fiction, like corporate personhood. It just means \u0026ldquo;the government leaves the market alone so the hierarchy can reveal itself.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to believe in an equal distribution of power. What are you, seven? This is just the way the world is. Look at alpha wolves, silverbacks; consider the lobster.\nYou are one, single individual within a system, and it is your job to rise or fall within it on the sweat of your own back. You don\u0026rsquo;t change the system. Society\u0026rsquo;s problems come from the rules being too weakly enforced. The answer is always more discipline. Your conservative friend thinks you\u0026rsquo;re naive for thinking the system even can be changed, and his is the charitable interpretation! Many conservatives assume liberals - at least, the smart liberals - know that the hierarchy is eternal, that there will always be people at the top and people at the bottom, so any claim towards making things equal must be a Trojan horse for something that benefits them [Realpolitik]. (Why would they assume that? Because that\u0026rsquo;s what they do.) The real liberal agenda is to put people in the wrong places on purpose. Boost liberal allies, hold back liberal opposition. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to break up the pyramid, you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to sneak someone else to the top.\n   A lot of conservative contradictions start to make sense through this lens. Of any issue, simply ask: does this distribute power, or consolidate it? If power flows up the hierarchy, they\u0026rsquo;re for it, if it flows down, they\u0026rsquo;re against it.\n   The thing about hierarchies is that they\u0026rsquo;re self-similar on many scales. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle, then you serve the king. Valar dohaeris [Valar dohaeris]. But, to everyone beneath you, you are the king. You\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job and a good wage, that gives you some power over people who don\u0026rsquo;t. And getting pissed at those above implies that those below have a right to be pissed at you. There\u0026rsquo;s a real anxiety that liberals want to make room for those people in the middle by putting conservatives at the bottom, and that those people will then treat conservatives the way conservatives treated them. Freedom, respect, and empathy are looked on as finite resources in a competitive marketplace just like jobs and scholarships.\n   No matter how much a conservative believes in \u0026ldquo;earning\u0026rdquo; one\u0026rsquo;s place, they have, always in the back of their mind, an image of what society should look like, and any discrepancy between imagination and observation must mean foul play. This feminist is too respected, this Black superhero is too popular, it can\u0026rsquo;t be because they\u0026rsquo;re worthy; someone must have put their hand on the scales. Someone got a freebie or played the race card or faked a scandal. This means, even though they claim the hierarchy is natural, what they will or won\u0026rsquo;t accept as legitimate is a gut feeling. If they like what they see, they take credit for it; if they don\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s the Left\u0026rsquo;s fault. And what does it say about them that they see a bunch of white, male sharks and think, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s authentic\u0026rdquo;?\n   Savvy viewers may be remembering another political philosophy that is hierarchical, undemocratic, built on nostalgia, and that likes to cloak its policies in progressive camouflage, and that\u0026rsquo;s the one from two videos ago: fascism. (ooooooohhhhhh golly) Now: I am not calling conservatives fascists. There are distinctions: Under fascism, the hierarchy is much, much less meritocratic, and the nostalgia is much, much older. However: conservative thinking is, at the very least, one that fascism maps more cleanly onto. Fascists appeal to this hierarchical mindset by portraying all of history as struggles between ethnic groups over who gets to be where. \u0026ldquo;Someone\u0026rsquo;s got to be at the bottom, white man. We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure it isn\u0026rsquo;t you.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll find, throughout history, that fascist movements, though they often pick up dissidents from all over the political spectrum (the \u0026ldquo;Third Position,\u0026rdquo; for instance, is fascism for anti-capitalists), when they find purchase in a political party, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much always the conservative party. Look at France, look at Brazil, look at here. Whether you want to interpret that as conservatives being uniquely susceptible to fascists, or diet fascism being another name for conservatism, I leave that up to you.\n   The most important thing to understand is that you cannot communicate with nor anticipate the behaviors of a conservative if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they believe. Which is hard, because they\u0026rsquo;re often in denial. You will never convince them to compromise on any attempt to break up the hierarchy, because even incremental change strikes them as revolutionary and they feel they\u0026rsquo;ve made too many concessions already. You will never get them, of their own free will, to agree to government regulation, because the government, as a democratic institution, is inherently unnatural. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like what a business is doing, you don\u0026rsquo;t regulate it, you take your money elsewhere. You should favor the capitalist solution, not the democratic one. (Also, when you vote with your dollar, people with more dollars get more votes.) They will never be onboard with aiding the poor in any systemic way, and will, instead, champion charity and crowdfunding, because minnows getting to eat should always be framed as a gift rather than a right. You may get individual conservatives to come around on some of these, but, as a body, they will never consent to any of it unless they can work it to their advantage or if you have leverage over them. They will sign on when denying progressivism costs them something, because few things terrify them more than slipping down the hierarchy [Also, Authoritarian followers place \u0026ldquo;being normal\u0026rdquo; substantially higher than most people do].\n   A good defense against fascism is to consciously, intentionally, think and act in democratic terms, because newsflash: we\u0026rsquo;re not actually lobsters. Neither of these systems is natural. They are choices we can make. I recommend this one, because egalitarian thinking is one thing Nazis are bad at infiltrating.\nIf you want to fight fascism, move left.\n Flashcards Conservatives tend to think {{like a capitalist; in hierarchies}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 8 425.06 2024-09-07T17:13:54Z    Extra Source (Danskin 2019)\nLiberals tend to think {{democratically; like an egalitarian}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 230.24 2023-09-19T22:27:55Z    Extra Source (Danskin 2019)\nHierarchies are {{self-similar}@0} on many scales    position ease box interval due     0 2.95 7 346.56 2024-02-06T17:30:51Z    Extra Source (Danskin 2019)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 7 267.27 2023-12-28T23:03:29Z   back 2.80 7 362.59 2024-05-28T05:45:10Z    Hierarchies are recursive\nBack Those at the top of the hierarchy have power over those lower in the hierarchy.

Claiming \u0026ldquo;the Card Says Moops\u0026rdquo; does not, so much, mean, \u0026ldquo;I believe the people who invaded Spain in the 8th Century were literally called The Moops,\u0026rdquo; but, rather, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t prove I don\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\u0026rdquo; Not a statement of sincere belief, simply moving a piece across the board.

You\u0026rsquo;ll change it later if you need to.\n   The thing is, Bob, it\u0026rsquo;s not that they\u0026rsquo;re lying, it\u0026rsquo;s that they just don\u0026rsquo;t care. I\u0026rsquo;ll say that again for the cheap seats: When they make these kinds of arguments, they legitimately do not care whether the words coming out of their mouths are true. It is a deeply held belief for precisely as long as it wins arguments.\n   You might now conclude the internet reactionary believes in nothing except winning arguments with liberals. And, like Newtonian physics, if you assume this framing, you will get highly useful results. If you enter conversation with Engelbert and Charlemagne believing they do not mean what they say, they are only entertaining notions, and, on a long enough timeline, they will eventually defend a position fundamentally incompatible with the one they defended earlier in the same argument, you will navigate that conversation much more effectively!\nBut, like Newtonian physics, this framing is lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True [Lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True].\n[Why is it always the libs?]\nSo much of conservative rhetoric is about maintaining ignorance of one\u0026rsquo;s own beliefs. To uphold the institution of imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy while thinking you are none of those things. (Well, OK, knowing you\u0026rsquo;re a capitalist, but thinking it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.) Most people have a baseline of fairly conventional, kindergarten morality, and conservatism often clashes with it. You can rationalize these contradictions - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a bigot, I just believe in states' rights\u0026rdquo; - but, as American conservatism gets more radical, it gets harder to square one\u0026rsquo;s politics with what one assumes to be one\u0026rsquo;s beliefs. So you learn, when someone challenges you, to cycle through beliefs until something sticks, just play your hand and trust that you\u0026rsquo;re right, or, in extreme cases, insist you have no beliefs at all, you\u0026rsquo;re just here to watch the world burn.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re not. They are willing participants in the burning of only certain parts. They don\u0026rsquo;t care what they believe, but they know what they hate, and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about why they hate it. On paper, they believe in freedom of religion and freedom of expression, but they also hang out in communities where Muslims and trans women are punching bags. And, like a sixth grader who believes one thing in Sunday school and another thing in biology class, they believe different things at different times.\n   If you operate as though there is no truth, just competing opinions, and as though opinions aren\u0026rsquo;t sincere, just tools to be picked up and dropped depending on their utility, then what are you operating under? Self-interest. The desire to win. You\u0026rsquo;ll defend the Holocaust just to feel smarter than someone, superior. Think about how beautifully that maps onto the in-group/out-group mentality of dominance and bigotry. Think how incompatible it is with liberal ideas of tolerance. I think this is why we don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of these \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just here to fuck shit up\u0026rdquo; types on the Left. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the Left has gotten on some bullshit, but (excepting politicians, whom you should never assume to mean anything they say) it\u0026rsquo;s sincerely-believed bullshit! We don\u0026rsquo;t build identities around saying things just to piss people off.\n Flashcards :PROPERTIES:\nThe card says moops :ANKI_DECK: Default\n:END:\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2019. “The Card Says Moops.” Tumblr.

But in response the Republicans… seize the Supreme Court.\n   When one party can be relied on to do the exact opposite of your worst behavior, good strategy is to do to them, as destructively as possible, whatever you don\u0026rsquo;t want them to do to you.\n   [\u0026hellip;] building a coalition on the Left is a lot of work, and, faced with this challenge, there is a liberal tendency to turn away from policy and focus instead on process; generally uncontroversial things like bipartisanship, compromise, decorum. And, fair enough, the absence of these things in Washington over the years is certainly something everyone Left-of-Center is sick of, but they\u0026rsquo;re not things Democrats can make happen all by themselves, and, more to the point, none of them are results. They\u0026rsquo;re means.\nLike, a willingness to compromise is not a position. And when you overfocus on how you should go about things and not what things you should go about, it fosters a certain philosophy about government that is both highly flawed and highly exploitable: The valuing of means at the expense of ends.\nMost people would say that \u0026ldquo;the ends justify the means\u0026rdquo; is a crap moral philosophy. Democrats would agree. But liberals often overcorrect to the point where thinking about the ends at all is thought of as - in a vague, reflexive kind of way - innately immoral. There\u0026rsquo;s a very Enlightenment way of thinking that implies that, with the right means, the ends take care of themselves, and immoral behavior becomes functionally impossible.\n   [\u0026hellip;] Democrats keep doing it, because on some level they genuinely believe that, even when it accomplishes nothing, following the rules to the bitter end is the noble thing to do. The captain goes down with the ship.\n   And I\u0026rsquo;ll say one thing for Republicans: They believe in something. It\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of classist, racist, misogynist doolally, but they believe it, and they govern according to those beliefs. There is no contradiction in blocking a liberal Judge and bullying Democrats to confirm a conservative one: They want to overturn the right to abortion, and will do whatever it takes to put a pro-lifer on the bench. It\u0026rsquo;s fully consistent behavior. And the problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that they break a bunch of rules along the way, it\u0026rsquo;s that what they\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish is wrong.\nBut Democrats focus on the rule-breaking and not the intent behind it because, despite what Republicans will tell you, many Democrats are terrified of talking about abortion, for fear that taking a stand on a wedge issue will lose them their coalition. Believing in a politics where everyone can disagree on everything and democracy sorts it out is wishful thinking born of necessity.\n   What would be the effective ways to combat the Alt-Right? Kick them off social media, shut down their websites, cut off their funding, police their organizations as hate groups, and, if all else fails, be willing to deck someone at a counter-protest if it will prevent greater violence. So what do they do to us? Falsely report our tweets as hatespeech, DDoS our websites, try to shut down our Patreons, report us to the police as terrorists, and beat and murder people in the streets. Now, these are all things they enjoy doing regardless, but they serve a strategic purpose. If we consider doing to them anything like to what they\u0026rsquo;ve done to us, we get the performative self-flagellation: \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to stoop to our level, now would you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd when they tell us it would be wrong to kick them off Twitter or stop them from organizing even though they keep killing people, what argument do they give us? They invoke the First Amendment. They defend not their actions but the process. They don\u0026rsquo;t believe in universal free speech or the right to assemble, but they know we do.\n   An action has no intrinsic value wholly separate from its outcome. A Kentucky clerk breaking the law by refusing to sign a legal gay marriage license is wrong. And a California clerk breaking the law by signing an illegal gay marriage license is right.

Historically, the first sign that things are about to get a lot worse for minorities is when the racism stops being euphemistic.\n Notes  Politicians only let a euphemism die when they don\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore.\n   Now, white racists have a complicated relationship to their own racism. They seemingly want the impossible: they want segregation without appearing to be segregationists, racist policy without the social repercussions. Possibly, they don\u0026rsquo;t even want to admit their racism to themselves. Silvermilk would need a framing that allowed the blithely racist, the overtly racist, and the non-racist to unite under a single banner.\nFor this purpose, Silvermilk landed on the long-enduring euphemism: \u0026ldquo;states' rights.\u0026rdquo; [You\u0026rsquo;re getting so abstract]\n   States' rights was invoked - and is still invoked - to defend anti-miscegenation laws, anti-abortion laws, same-sex marriage bans, trans bathroom bills, spousal rape, you name it. Every time there are gains for social minorities, the Republicans shore up the votes of bigots who find these gains offensive.\n   It\u0026rsquo;s hard for the Left to argue with the \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; argument because it\u0026rsquo;s not designed to make sense. Republicans will say we should leave an issue like same-sex marriage up to the states, but only after a Federal ban on same-sex marriage proves infeasible. Up until that moment, they are in favor of government overreach. So \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; has never been a consistent philosophy, but, then, why should it be? It\u0026rsquo;s a euphemism. Its sole purpose is bringing an extreme ideology into mainstream politics.\n   [\u0026hellip;] loyalty is one of the strongest things in politics today. Come Election Day, people who disavowed him was making phone calls on [Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s] behalf.\n   A euphemism dies when it no longer works to disguise things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said, or when culture at large decides things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said are now sayable. In the last couple videos, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about how the Far Right mainstreams a, for instance, racist idea by convincing people it\u0026rsquo;s not racist. What we\u0026rsquo;re seeing here is the endgame of that process: once the public embraces them as people, elects their politicians, and implements their policies, they begin, bit by bit, to drop the pretense. Because, if they want to close the borders once and for all, it\u0026rsquo;s in their best interest to stop pretending border control is about protecting jobs.\nA sad truth about humans is they will often accept almost any justification to keep doing whatever they\u0026rsquo;re already doing [Cognitive dissonance]. If someone has spent years favoring border security - they\u0026rsquo;ve voted for it, their taxes have paid for it, maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve even called ICE on someone - and one day you tell them, \u0026ldquo;Keep doing what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, but, by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s not about jobs anymore, now it\u0026rsquo;s about keeping Mexicans out,\u0026rdquo; a lot of them will roll with it. We like to think action follows belief, and sometimes it does, but at least as often it\u0026rsquo;s the reverse. And that\u0026rsquo;s a dangerous thing when given the choice to do something different or do the same thing only more.\nTo the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right.

I find their work very inspiring.\u0026rdquo; So you look a little deeper into the story, and you come to understand a few things. First, it turns out, by \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X\u0026rdquo; they mean an employee of Public Figure X. Well, employees are often acting on behalf of their employers; if your campaign staff meets with Russians, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say you are in contact with Russia, so maybe this is something like that. Also, it turns out that, by \u0026ldquo;employee\u0026rdquo; they mean a contractor that Public Figure X hired several years ago. Well, OK, if a contractor does something on behalf of a client, that\u0026rsquo;s often basically the same as an employee doing it. And, apparently, by \u0026ldquo;doxxed\u0026rdquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t mean Public Figure X - or Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s contractor - personally hacked anyone\u0026rsquo;s computer, they mean Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s people shared information that had been acquired by someone else. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s fair, if someone posts your home address on a forum and then the forum spreads it all over the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say the forum doxxed you. Oh, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a home address or a private email, it was the person\u0026rsquo;s name. Well, if you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous for safety reasons, having your name revealed can lead to threats or silencing, so, depending on why you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous, having your name leaked can be a kind of doxxing. Oh, and by \u0026ldquo;leaking a name,\u0026rdquo; they mean, liked a tweet that had the name in it.\n   OK, now say you\u0026rsquo;re bumming around Facebook - which, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, but I do it, too - and someone posts an article saying \u0026ldquo;All pornography is coercive.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty sweeping statement! I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta investigate this.\u0026rdquo; So you read the article, and it seems there\u0026rsquo;s a school of thought that, since, in porn, the product is usually images of women\u0026rsquo;s bodies, women tend to be socially pressured or financially incentivized to do things with their bodies that people like to see but they aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily comfortable with. Since that consent is not freely given, all pornography is coercive. And you think, \u0026ldquo;Well, but what about worker-owned porn collectives, or amateur porn that\u0026rsquo;s just exhiitionists who don\u0026rsquo;t monetize their videos?\u0026rdquo; And, after digging around the author\u0026rsquo;s work, you find, buried in a footnote in another article, that, in their opinion, if it\u0026rsquo;s worker-owned or unmonetized, it isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;porn,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;erotica.\u0026rdquo;\n   Now say you\u0026rsquo;ve ambled into the wildlands of Tumblr - woe betide the ones who travel too far from their dashboards - and you come across the claim that \u0026ldquo;[Activist Y] is a bigot.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Ah jeez, first Public Figure X and now this?\u0026rdquo; So you read a number of other posts on the subject, and eventually piece together that, by \u0026ldquo;bigot,\u0026rdquo; the people making this claim mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; - which, no question, that is a bigotry - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; - which, OK, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; - which is definitely a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;is critical of the sexual objectification of women in Fantasy imagery because they believe it drives women away from the community.\u0026rdquo;\n   How many words can you change in an argument until it\u0026rsquo;s not the same argument anymore?\n   There are a few different aims when somebody does this:\n  Making the unacceptable acceptable\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Activist Y is against sexual objectification\u0026rdquo; is not controversial amongst progressives. If you go after Activist Y for that belief, you\u0026rsquo;re going to make progressive enemies. But if you redefine this as \u0026ldquo;anti-sex,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;a bigot,\u0026rdquo; now it\u0026rsquo;s Activist Y who has the enemies, and you\u0026rsquo;ve just smuggled an anti-feminist argument into feminist language.\n  Making the unremarkable remarkable\n\u0026ldquo;Some pornography is coercive\u0026rdquo; is not the kind of take that sells magazine subscriptions. But if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a private definition of \u0026ldquo;pornography\u0026rdquo; that excludes sexually explicit material that isn\u0026rsquo;t coercive, you\u0026rsquo;ve got yourself a provocative headline, especially since, at first glance, nobody knows you\u0026rsquo;re using a nonstandard definition of the word.\n  Cutting people off from their communities\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Someone who used to work with Public Figure X liked a tweet that had my name in it\u0026rdquo; gets converted into \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X doxxed me\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of turning Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s community against them, with the added benefit of gaining favor with anyone who already hates them. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard abusive [relationship] tactic: if you want to mistreat someone, first you cut them off from their friends.\n  [formatting added]\n   One can make the (already dubious) argument that this isnt technically a lie, but it\u0026rsquo;s meant to form a picture in your mind of something that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen [\u0026hellip;].\n   [\u0026hellip;] when the Right does this, it does it to the Left, and, when the Left does this, it does it to itself. The Far Right is perfectly happy converting an attack or a bad argument into whatever they think progressive language sounds like, and bigots on the Left are perfectly happy sneaking transphobic arguments into feminism, but the Left, by and large, will not touch conservative language. We don\u0026rsquo;t try to isolate a member of the Alt-Right by telling his community he\u0026rsquo;s a race traitor or secretly gay.\n Flashcards Ship of Theseus (argument) References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2018. “The Ship of Theseus.” Tumblr.

But people usually have only so much control over how and how fast this happens: A group expands its language and visibility; if this leads to larger numbers and greater mainstream acceptance, the process repeats, this time with a bigger group and a bigger audience; so long as there is growth, each cycle is more impactful, as the bigger a group is the faster it gets even bigger and the more common language becomes the faster it proliferates.\n   By all rights, if your beliefs are wildly unpopular, this process shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. Your language and visibility don\u0026rsquo;t expand because too many people don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk like you or about you. So what do you do then? Well, normally, you either give up or bide your time, but, if you have a lot of media literacy and no real moral compass, you get it done dirty.\nIf the media doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to cover you, make yourself newsworthy. Threaten to publicly out immigrants in front of a crowd. Start a hoax about white student unions. Lead a white power rally and leave the hoods at home. Do the kinds of things that journalists cannot, in good conscience, ignore. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve made yourself news, they\u0026rsquo;ll feel they can\u0026rsquo;t publish a condemnation without getting your side of the story, so, bam, you\u0026rsquo;ve got an interview. The more erratic and dangerous you seem, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll want to write a profile so people can figure you out; the article about how surprisingly normal you seem in person basically writes itself. If you want to spread a conspiracy theory, send it to a small, local news site that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the resources to fact check you; once they publish something salacious, all the bigger news channels will have to talk about it, if only to debunk it. Put provocative stuff in front of politicians; anything they retweet has to be news. In a pinch, you can always piggyback off a famous activist by making takedown videos, or, if you\u0026rsquo;re really ambitious, harass someone at a conference.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s desperate for clicks. If you can generate them, you\u0026rsquo;ll get your message out.\nIf nobody\u0026rsquo;s adopting your language, adopt it for them. Make sure you and all your friends each have half a dozen fake Twitter accounts spamming the same terminology at everyone who discusses race, gender, orientation, or ability. Put every Jewish name in parentheses until everyone on the internet knows what that means whether they want to or not. Hell, don\u0026rsquo;t even do it yourself: Russia\u0026rsquo;s not the only one who can make bots. Make thousands of bots. And make sure your real account, your fake accounts, and your bots all talk the same so no one can tell the difference anymore. Make hashtags and get them trending all by yourself, and, while you\u0026rsquo;re at it, spam all the hashtags for movements you hate with porn and gore so they can\u0026rsquo;t be used. And if your words and memes still aren\u0026rsquo;t popular? Just steal words and memes that are already popular. Just decide \u0026ldquo;this? this means white power now,\u0026rdquo; [Pepe the frog] \u0026ldquo;this is antifeminist now\u0026rdquo; [\u0026ldquo;triggered\u0026rdquo;]. Saturate the web with your new usage, always insisting that you\u0026rsquo;re doing it \u0026ldquo;ironically,\u0026rdquo; [For the lulz] while eroding confidence in anyone who uses these words in the original sense. And never stop insisting that most everyone would talk the same as you if there weren\u0026rsquo;t so much damn censorship.\n   And where Delany saw a group of 80 or 90 gay men reported in the papers as a group of 4 or 5, the Alt-Right wants to get reported as being much larger than it actually is. They want to draw attention to themselves by any means necessary, up to and including violence, but to ensure that, any time the cameras train on a violent act, there is a man in a suit ready to distance himself from it; to paint the picture that, but for a few bad actors, this is a peaceful movement of young, presentable intellectuals.\n   Much as we\u0026rsquo;d like to believe people are driven by morality, most people are driven by the desire to be normal [Bob Altemeyer | The Authoritarians]. And when the news is filled with images of swastikas, iron crosses, and tiki torches, the guy in the suit with the fashy haircut looks pretty normal by comparison. And that\u0026rsquo;s why he wears the suit.\n Flashcards Mainstreaming References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2018. “Mainstreaming.” Tumblr.

Display the outward signs of winning \u0026ndash; confidence, always have a comeback, speak in soundbites, attack attack attack \u0026ndash; and the audience may think that you won even if your opponent refutes your argument.\nNotes  You also notice the pattern of the conversation: he says something short, quippy, and wrong, you give a detailed correction, he says something else short, quippy, wrong, and only tangentially related to his last point, and the cycle repeats itself. This goes on and on.\n   The running theme here is all these people who ostensibly want a frank exchange of ideas spend a lot more time making accusations than asking questions. Because, why ask what you believe when they can tell you what you believe and make you correct them? And if you ever don\u0026rsquo;t correct them, must be because they\u0026rsquo;re right.\n   And you\u0026rsquo;re not naive; you see what\u0026rsquo;s going on here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about conversation, it\u0026rsquo;s about boxes. When you say something cogent that they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with, and they get the sinking feeling that you might start making sense, they need a reason not to listen to you [Cognitive dissonance]. So they reach for a box to stick you in: dishonest feminism, fake progressivism, daddy-issue liberalism. No one in those boxes is worth listening to, which means, as long as they\u0026rsquo;ve got you in one, they\u0026rsquo;re not at risk of having their minds changed. This isn\u0026rsquo;t even an argument with you, not really; their presenting themselves with arguments for why they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to you.\nSo your first reflex is to defy their expectations. \u0026ldquo;Actually, my dad was a draft-dodging hippie who told me he loved me every day.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And I never said what genders my partners are but I promise they\u0026rsquo;re all feminists.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As for my accent- actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with the accent thing.\u0026rdquo; But the point is, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to fit in your box.\u0026rdquo; And if they can\u0026rsquo;t put you in one, if they can\u0026rsquo;t dismiss you outright, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to engage with your argument.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;ve spent any time arguing with angry dudes online you know what I\u0026rsquo;m about to say: They don\u0026rsquo;t. This accusatory, condescending attitude never falters. Because a technique that has permeated anti-progressivism is to Never Play Defense.\n   Now don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, what I said about the Right fitting the Left into simplified boxes as a way of preserving their own egos, I do think that\u0026rsquo;s a thing, at least for many people much of the time. And I think the reassurance it brings is why the technique stays so popular. But that framing is about how individual people are feeling in isolated moments, and leaves out the larger game that\u0026rsquo;s being played. Because there is a long-term strategic value to never playing defense, and it\u0026rsquo;s less to do with arguments than with attitude.\nFrom your perspective, this debate about the feminist is a joke. This guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about, he comes in hot without confirming any of his assumptions, the whole conversation is you repeatedly schooling an ignorant dipshit. But that\u0026rsquo;s only if you\u0026rsquo;re the fool who listens to what\u0026rsquo;s actually being said. Never Play Defense is a strategy that looks past language to posture; the tone, word choice, even the expressions on your faces. If you half-focus your eyes and look not at the words but the flow of the conversation, you can see the dynamic at play:\nHe says his short, quippy statement, and you give your detailed rebuttal. He then picks a single point from your response and attacks that as the new subject. Now, to an onlooker, the logical brain would register that he\u0026rsquo;s leaving 90% of your argument on the table, and that, by changing positions, he\u0026rsquo;s conceding he lost the first round. But the lizard brain notices that he\u0026rsquo;s always making the accusations, always in the dominant position, that he\u0026rsquo;s always acting and you\u0026rsquo;re always reacting. Regardless of what is said, he displays all the outward signs of winning. So, on a purely emotional level, he leaves the impression of being right.\nI have never had an argument look like this that wasn\u0026rsquo;t in public. This is a technique that means speaking not so much to the other person as to the people watching [Speak directly to the audience]. Liberals tend to operate as though voters are beings of pure reason, and neglect that rational people still have emotions, and those emotions factor into what they believe. And that long after this argument is over, when people only half-remember what was said, what lingers on is what impressions the speakers made.\nRonald Reagan coined the phrase, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re explaining, you\u0026rsquo;re losing.\u0026rdquo; The trick is, if he\u0026rsquo;s always accusing, then you\u0026rsquo;re always explaining.\n   [\u0026hellip;] if you never look like you\u0026rsquo;re losing, you can convince a lot of people that you\u0026rsquo;re [winning]. And, if you keep your statements short and punchy, people will remember what you said better than they remember the long explanation of why it\u0026rsquo;s untrue. If done correctly, you might even convince yourself you know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\n   This argument isn\u0026rsquo;t just about sticking a woman in the Lying Feminism box so she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be listened to, it\u0026rsquo;s also signaling to anyone watching what box they should stick her in. Even if an onlooker recognizes that she literally did not con anyone out of their money, the idea that how much she asked for and how long she took to deliver are relevant to her credibility is still planted in their heads. It subtly suggests that, the next time they feel threatened by a female media critic, maybe they should look at how much money she makes, how long her work takes to produce; maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to her, because they\u0026rsquo;ve got this handy box.\n[\u0026hellip;] The Alt-Right is a box factory, putting huge swaths of Leftist rhetoric, most especially that that would rebut their core positions, into categories where they can be summarily ignored.\n   A detailed explanation lands a lot better when it\u0026rsquo;s not being contrasted with a sound bite.\n Flashcards Never play defense References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Never Play Defense.” Tumblr.

More specifically, it\u0026rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] every one of these bad arguments is a subtle attempt to change the subject.\n   What is the purpose of debate? The liberal conception of debate is usually along the lines of Joseph Joubert\u0026rsquo;s adage, \u0026ldquo;The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re thinking Plato and Glaucon, or, maybe, debate club: two sides debate until one side wins or until a third conclusion is reached together; either way, the goal of debate is to arrive at the truth.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not what debate means on the Right. There, debate is a chance to perform strength, integrity, and certainty. There, you don\u0026rsquo;t debate until a victor is declared, you debate as long as you can keep eyeballs on you, forever if possible. There, the truth doesn\u0026rsquo;t win, because nobody wins, not in any formal way. You may scoff at that, but let\u0026rsquo;s think about it: this is how political debates are structured in the US, where two candidates come in already knowing everything they\u0026rsquo;re going to say, where it\u0026rsquo;s political suicide to concede any point or find any compromise, and where who \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; is up to the voters. In such a framework, truth and falsity don\u0026rsquo;t exist; all that matters is how much of the audience agrees with you. And, if that\u0026rsquo;s your framework, then what\u0026rsquo;s in your best interest is to steer the conversation swiftly and efficiently to something you and your opponent will never agree on, because that gives you the most opportunities to look firm in front of an adversary.\n   [\u0026hellip;] the Left\u0026rsquo;s understanding of systemic issues does not jive with the Right\u0026rsquo;s views on personal responsibility. Yes, of course, if the President spoke this way in the White House it might be alienating to any woman who works there, but the Right sees this as a personal failing on the part of the woman, not a systemic failing on the part of men. And all the articles, all the data, all the reports that say that\u0026rsquo;s now how things work in practice, they are useless in the framework of a performative Twitter argument or a one-hour TV debate. A proper understanding of institutional sexism just takes longer than that.\n   Why would anyone use this framework? Well, if your opposition has facts on their side, then you need a framework where facts aren\u0026rsquo;t important. But, more broadly, if the goal is to win over the public, well, the public does respond to honesty, but they also respond to moral certainty, and the Right tends to sell certainty better than the Left sells truth. This is what they\u0026rsquo;re good at; this suits their worldview. They speak of a universe where opposing sides never agree, because agreement is impossible. And, since agreement is impossible, you never have to compromise. And, since politics isn\u0026rsquo;t about compromise, it\u0026rsquo;s just about outnumbering your competition by any means necessary and obstructing them at every turn when they outnumber you. There is comfort in the idea that people are just fundamentally different, and that they owe each other nothing.\n   [\u0026hellip;] the Democrats' desire for compromise is a weakness that can be exploited. On a gut level, the Right knows what debate means on the Left, knows that the Left wants to meet in the middle. So all they have to do is bait the Left into having the discussion on their terms and then keep insisting they should find common ground. \u0026ldquo;You could work with us if you\u0026rsquo;d only try a little harder.\u0026rdquo; Because the rules of that debate, where you concede points and look for compromise, in their world, make the Left look weak. As long as the Right controls the terms of debate, conciliatory loses.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how they control the conversation: move the entire debate to their framework using a bad argument as the worm on the hook.\n Flashcards Control the conversation References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Control the Conversation.” Tumblr.

In short: tolerance and forgiveness aren\u0026rsquo;t easy and if they feel easy then you\u0026rsquo;re likely not actually tolerating or forgiving but rather remarking \u0026ldquo;No harm done.\u0026rdquo;\nThoughts Tolerance of intolerance Regarding the bit about Brendan Eich1:\n Think of Brendan Eich as a member of a tiny religious minority surrounded by people who hate that minority. Suddenly firing him doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\n Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m either (1) misinterpreting Scott Alexander here or (2) showing my tribal bias too blatantly but this reads as:\n Think of the persecutor as a member of the persecuted. Suddenly resisting them doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\n Hot take: Political beliefs aren\u0026rsquo;t just an intellectual exercise \u0026ndash; they have consequences. Resisting the expansion of power by those who hold incompatible political opinions is a reasonable course of action.\n And if you mix together the open-source tech industry and the parallel universe where you can\u0026rsquo;t wear a FreeBSD t-shirt without risking someone trying to exorcise you, you can prove that Christians are scary and very powerful people who are persecuting everyone else all the time, and you have a great excuse for kicking one of the few people willing to affiliate with the Red Tribe, a guy who never hurt anyone, out of town.\nWhen a friend of mine heard Eich got fired, she didn\u0026rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. \u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except intolerance,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Intolerance\u0026rdquo; is starting to look like another one of those words like \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.\u0026rdquo; Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound quite so noble now, does it?\n[link added]\n I take exception with \u0026ldquo;a guy who never hurt anyone\u0026rdquo; which is only true in the sense that I don\u0026rsquo;t know of Eich every assaulting anyone. However, support for anti-same-sex marriage legislation does hurt people.\nBlue and red tribes I\u0026rsquo;m not sure Red and Blue tribes (which seem to approximate Rural and Urban americans) are the ultimate definition but I agree that they\u0026rsquo;re a better clustering tool than Republican and Democrat. That is, two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Blue tribe (as opposed to Red tribe) are more likely, in my opinion, than two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Democrat (as opposed to Republican).\nNotes  So what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don\u0026rsquo;t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you\u0026rsquo;ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.\n   The people who are actually into this sort of thing sketch out a bunch of speculative tribes and subtribes, but to make it easier, let me stick with two and a half.\nThe Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting \u0026ldquo;USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!\u0026rdquo;, and listening to country music.\nThe Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to \u0026ldquo;everything except country\u0026rdquo;.\n   And my hypothesis, stated plainly, is that if you\u0026rsquo;re part of the Blue Tribe, then your outgroup isn\u0026rsquo;t al-Qaeda, or Muslims, or blacks, or gays, or transpeople, or Jews, or atheists – it\u0026rsquo;s the Red Tribe.\n   My hunch – both the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe, for whatever reason, identify \u0026ldquo;America\u0026rdquo; with the Red Tribe. Ask people for typically \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; things, and you end up with a very Red list of characteristics – guns, religion, barbecues, American football, NASCAR, cowboys, SUVs, unrestrained capitalism.\nThat means the Red Tribe feels intensely patriotic about \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; country, and the Blue Tribe feels like they\u0026rsquo;re living in fortified enclaves deep in hostile territory.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOn both sides, \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; can be either a normal demonym, or a code word for a member of the Red Tribe.\n   But I think the situation with \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; is much the same as the situation with \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2014. “I Can Tolerate Anything Except The Outgroup.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/. “Brendan Eich.” 2022. Wikipedia, July. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brendan_Eich\u0026#38;oldid=1096478375.     On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation. The appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s past political donations – specifically, a 2008 donation of \\$1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the banning of same-sex marriage in California, and donations in the amount of \\$2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom McClintock between 2008 and 2010. The Wall Street Journal initially reported that, in protest against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff) stepped down, leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert. CNET later reported that of the three board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Lilly told The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;I left rather than appoint him\u0026rdquo;, and declined to elaborate further.\nOn March 26, 2014, Eich expressed \u0026ldquo;sorrow for causing pain\u0026rdquo; and pledged to \u0026ldquo;work with LGBT communities and allies\u0026rdquo; at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about Eich\u0026rsquo;s donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link to continue with Firefox). CREDO Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich resign.\nAfter 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla over his opposition to same-sex marriage. In his personal blog, he posted, \u0026ldquo;under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader\u0026rdquo;. Mozilla made a press release saying that board members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.\n(“Brendan Eich” 2022)\n \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;   ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/0a065f64-1e20-4bbf-8c4b-2a60415bdb43/","summary":"Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2014)\nSummary A meditation on what it means to be tolerant.

The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived. Sometimes the dragon would devour these unfortunate souls upon arrival; sometimes again it would lock them up in the mountain where they would wither away for months or years before eventually being consumed.\nThe misery inflicted by the dragon tyrant was incalculable. In addition to the ten thousand who were gruesomely slaughtered each day, there were the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, children, and friends who were left behind to grieve the loss of their departed loved ones.\nSome people tried to fight the dragon, but whether they were brave or foolish was difficult to say. Priests and magicians called down curses, to no avail. Warriors, armed with roaring courage and the best weapons the smiths could produce, attacked it, but were incinerated by its fire before coming close enough to strike. Chemists concocted toxic brews and tricked the dragon into swallowing them, but the only apparent effect was to further stimulate its appetite. The dragon\u0026rsquo;s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armour so impregnable, and its whole nature so robust, as to make it invincible to any human assault.\nSeeing that defeating the tyrant was impossible, humans had no choice but to obey its commands and pay the grisly tribute. The fatalities selected were always elders. Although senior people were as vigorous and healthy as the young, and sometimes wiser, the thinking was that they had at least already enjoyed a few decades of life. The wealthy might gain a brief reprieve by bribing the press gangs that came to fetch them, but, by constitutional law, nobody, not even the king himself, could put off their turn indefinitely.\nSpiritual men sought to comfort those who were afraid of being eaten by the dragon (which included almost everyone, although many denied it in public) by promising another life after death, a life that would be free from the dragon scourge. Other orators argued that the dragon had its place in the natural order and a moral right to be fed. They said it was part of the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s stomach. Others still maintained that the dragon was good for the human species because it kept the population size down. To what extent these arguments convinced the worried souls is not known. Most people tried to cope by not thinking about the grim end that awaited them.\nFor many centuries this desperate state of affairs continued. Nobody kept count any longer of the cumulative death toll, nor of the number of tears shed by the bereft. Expectations had gradually adjusted and the dragon tyrant had become a fact of life. In view of the evident futility of resistance, attempts to kill the dragon had ceased. Instead, efforts now focused on placating it. Although the dragon would occasionally raid the cities, it was found that the punctual delivery to the mountain of its quota of life reduced the frequency of these incursions.\nKnowing that their turn to become dragon fodder was always impending, people began having children earlier and more often. It was not uncommon for a girl to be pregnant by her sixteenth birthday. Couples often spawned a dozen children. The human population was thus kept from shrinking, and the dragon was kept from going hungry.\nOver the course of these centuries, the dragon, being well fed, slowly but steadily grew bigger. It had become almost as large as the mountain on which it lived and its appetite had increased proportionately. Ten thousand human bodies were no longer enough to fill its belly. It now demanded eighty thousand, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.\nWhat occupied the king\u0026rsquo;s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself was the logistics of collecting and transporting so many people to the mountain every day. This was not an easy task.\nTo facilitate the process, the king had a railway track constructed: two straight lines of glistening steel leading up to the dragon\u0026rsquo;s abode. Every twenty minutes, a train would arrive at the mountain terminal crammed with people, and would return empty. On moonlit nights, the passengers travelling on this train, if there had been windows for them to stick their heads out of, would have been able to see in front of them the double silhouette of the dragon and the mountain, and two glowing red eyes, like the beams from a pair of giant lighthouses, pointing the way to annihilation.\nServants were employed by the king in large numbers to administer the tribute. There were registrars who kept track of whose turn it was to be sent. There were people collectors who would be dispatched in special carts to fetch the designated people. Often travelling at breakneck speed, they would rush their cargo either to a railway station or directly to the mountain. There were clerks who administered the pensions paid to the decimated families who were no longer able to support themselves. There were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon, trying to ease their anguish with spirits and drugs.\nThere was, moreover, a cadre of dragonologists, who studied how these logistical processes could be made more efficient. Some dragonologists also conducted studies of the dragon\u0026rsquo;s physiology and behaviour, and collected samples—its shed scales, the slime that drooled from its jaws, its lost teeth, and its excrements, which were specked with fragments of human bone. All these items were painstakingly annotated and archived. The more the beast was understood, the more the general perception of its invincibility was confirmed. Its black scales, in particular, were harder than any material known to man, and there seemed no way to make as much as a scratch in its armour.\nTo finance all these activities, the king levied heavy taxes on his people. Dragon related expenditures, already accounting for one seventh of the economy, were growing even faster than the dragon itself.\nHumanity is a curious species. Every once in a while, somebody gets a good idea. Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements. Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed. Some of these devices—calculators, thermometers, microscopes, and the glass vials that the chemists use to boil and distil liquids—serve to make it easier to generate and try out new ideas, including ideas that expedite the process of idea generation.\nThus the great wheel of invention, which had turned at an almost imperceptibly slow pace in the older ages, gradually began to accelerate.\nSages predicted that a day would come when technology would enable humans to fly and do many other astonishing things. One of the sages, who was held in high esteem by some of the other sages but whose eccentric manners had made him a social outcast and recluse, went so far as to predict that technology would eventually make it possible to build a contraption that could kill the dragon tyrant.\nThe king\u0026rsquo;s scholars, however, dismissed these ideas. They said that humans were far too heavy to fly and in any case lacked feathers. As for the impossible notion that the dragon tyrant could be killed, history books recounted hundreds of attempts to do just that, not one of which had been successful. \u0026ldquo;We all know that this man had some irresponsible ideas,\u0026rdquo; a scholar of letters later wrote in his obituary of the reclusive sage who had by then been sent off to be devoured by the beast whose demise he had foretold, \u0026ldquo;but his writings were quite entertaining and perhaps we should be grateful to the dragon for making possible the interesting genre of dragon bashing literature which reveals so much about the culture of angst!\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, the wheel of invention kept turning. Mere decades later, humans did fly and accomplished many other astonishing things.\nA few iconoclastic dragonologists began arguing for a new attack on the dragon tyrant. Killing the dragon would not be easy, they said, but if some material could be invented that was harder than the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour, and if this material could be fashioned into some kind of projectile, then maybe the feat would be possible. At first, the iconoclasts' ideas were rejected by their dragonologist peers on grounds that no known material was harder than dragon scales. But after working on the problem for many years, one of the iconoclasts succeeded in demonstrating that a dragon scale could be pierced by an object made of a certain composite material. Many dragonologists who had previously been sceptical now joined the iconoclasts. Engineers calculated that a huge projectile could be made of this material and launched with sufficient force to penetrate the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour.\nThe manufacture of the needed quantity of the composite material would, however, be expensive.\nA group of several eminent engineers and dragonologists sent a petition to the king asking for funding to build the antidragon projectile. At the time when the petition was sent, the king was preoccupied with leading his army into war against a tiger. The tiger had killed a farmer and subsequently disappeared into the jungle. There was widespread fear in the countryside that the tiger might come out and strike again. The king had the jungle surrounded and ordered his troops to begin slashing their way through it. At the conclusion of the campaign, the king could announce that all 163 tigers in the jungle, including presumably the murderous one, had been hunted down and killed. During the tumult of the war, however, the petition had been lost or forgotten.\nThe petitioners therefore sent another appeal. This time they received a reply from one of the king\u0026rsquo;s secretaries saying that the king would consider their request after he was done reviewing the annual dragon administration budget. This year\u0026rsquo;s budget was the largest to date and included funding for a new railway track to the mountain. A second track was deemed necessary, as the original track could no longer support the increasing traffic. (The tribute demanded by the dragon tyrant had increased to one hundred thousand human beings, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.) When the budget was finally approved, however, reports were coming from a remote part of the country that a village was suffering from a rattlesnake infestation. The king had to leave urgently to mobilise his army and ride off to defeat this new threat. The antidragonists' appeal was filed away in a dusty cabinet in the castle basement.\nThe antidragonists met again to decide what was to be done. The debate was animated and continued long into the night. It was almost daybreak when they finally resolved to take the matter to the people. Over the following weeks, they travelled around the country, gave public lectures, and explained their proposal to anyone who would listen. At first, people were sceptical. They had been taught in school that the dragon tyrant was invincible and that the sacrifices it demanded had to be accepted as a fact of life. Yet when they learnt about the new composite material and about the designs for the projectile, many became intrigued. In increasing numbers, citizens flocked to the antidragonist lectures. Activists started organising public rallies in support of the proposal.\nWhen the king read about these meetings in the newspaper, he summoned his advisors and asked them what they thought about them. They informed him about the petitions that had been sent but told him that the antidragonists were troublemakers whose teachings were causing public unrest. It was much better for the social order, they said, that the people accepted the inevitability of the dragon tyrant tribute. The dragon administration provided many jobs that would be lost if the dragon was slaughtered. There was no known social good coming from the conquest of the dragon. In any case, the king\u0026rsquo;s coffers were currently nearly empty after the two military campaigns and the funding set aside for the second railway line. The king, who was at the time enjoying great popularity for having vanquished the rattlesnake infestation, listened to his advisors' arguments but worried that he might lose some of his popular support if he was seen to ignore the antidragonist petition. He therefore decided to hold an open hearing. Leading dragonologists, ministers of the state, and interested members of the public were invited to attend.\nThe meeting took place on the darkest day of the year, just before the Christmas holidays, in the largest hall of the royal castle. The hall was packed to the last seat and people were crowding in the aisles. The mood was charged with an earnest intensity normally reserved for pivotal wartime sessions.\nAfter the king had welcomed everyone, he gave the floor to the leading scientist behind the antidragonist proposal, a woman with a serious, almost stern expression on her face. She proceeded to explain in clear language how the proposed device would work and how the requisite amount of the composite material could be manufactured. Given the requested amount of funding, it should be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years. With an even greater amount of funding, it might be possible to do it in as little as twelve years. There could, however, be no absolute guarantee that it would work. The crowd followed her presentation intently.\nNext to speak was the king\u0026rsquo;s chief advisor for morality, a man with a booming voice that easily filled the auditorium.\n\u0026ldquo;Let us grant that this woman is correct about the science and that the project is technologically possible, although I don\u0026rsquo;t think that has actually been proven. Now she desires that we get rid of the dragon. Presumably, she thinks she\u0026rsquo;s got the right not to be chewed up by the dragon. How wilful and presumptuous. The finitude of human life is a blessing for every individual, whether he knows it or not. Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem like such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our human dignity. The preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realising more fully the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive. It is debasing, yes debasing, for a person to want to continue his or her mediocre life for as long as possible without worrying about some of the higher questions about what life is to be used for. But I tell you, the nature of the dragon is to eat humans, and our own species specified nature is truly and nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten by it\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe audience listened respectfully to this highly decorated speaker. The phrases were so eloquent that it was hard to resist the feeling that some deep thoughts must lurk behind them, although nobody could quite grasp what they were. Surely, words coming from such a distinguished appointee of the king must have profound substance.\nThe speaker next in line was a spiritual sage who was widely respected for his kindness and gentleness as well as for his devotion. As he strode to the podium, a small boy yelled out from the audience: \u0026ldquo;The dragon is bad!\u0026rdquo;\nThe boy\u0026rsquo;s parents turned bright red and began hushing and scolding the child. But the sage said: \u0026ldquo;Let the boy speak. He is probably wiser than an old fool like me.\u0026rdquo;\nAt first, the boy was too scared and confused to move but when he saw the genuinely friendly smile on the sage\u0026rsquo;s face and the outreached hand, he obediently took it and followed the sage up to the podium. \u0026ldquo;Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a brave little man,\u0026rdquo; said the sage. \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid of the dragon?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want my granny back,\u0026rdquo; said the boy.\n\u0026ldquo;Did the dragon take your granny away?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; the boy said, tears welling up in his large frightened eyes. \u0026ldquo;Granny promised that she would teach me how to bake gingerbread cookies for Christmas. She said that we would make a little house out of gingerbread and little gingerbread men that would live in it. Then those people in white clothes came and took Granny away to the dragon\u0026hellip;The dragon is bad and it eats people…I want my Granny back!\u0026rdquo;\nAt this point the child was crying so hard that the sage had to return him to his parents.\nThere were several other speakers that evening, but the child\u0026rsquo;s simple testimony had punctured the rhetorical balloon that the king\u0026rsquo;s ministers had tried to inflate. The people were backing the antidragonists, and by the end of the evening even the king had come to recognise the reason and the humanity of their cause. In his closing statement, he simply said: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the news spread, celebrations erupted in the streets. Those who had been campaigning for the antidragonists toasted each other and drank to the future of humanity.\nThe next morning, a billion people woke up and realised that their turn to be sent to the dragon would come before the projectile would be completed. A tipping point was reached. Whereas before, active support for the antidragonist cause had been limited to a small group of visionaries, it now became the number one priority and concern on everybody\u0026rsquo;s mind. The abstract notion of \u0026ldquo;the general will\u0026rdquo; took on an almost tangible intensity and concreteness. Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase the level of state support. The king responded to these appeals. In his New Year address, he announced that he would pass an extra appropriations bill to support the project at a high level of funding; additionally, he would sell off his summer castle and some of his land and make a large personal donation. \u0026ldquo;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon tyrant.\u0026rdquo;\nThus started a great technological race against time. The concept of an antidragon projectile was simple, but to make it a reality required solutions to a thousand smaller technical problems, each of which required dozens of time consuming steps and missteps. Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction. In one tragic accident, a wayward missile landed on a hospital and killed several hundred patients and staff. Now, however, there was a real seriousness of purpose, and the tests continued even as the corpses were being dug out from the debris.\nDespite almost unlimited funding and round the clock work by the technicians, the king\u0026rsquo;s deadline could not be met. The decade concluded and the dragon was still alive and well. The effort, however, was getting closer. A prototype missile had been successfully test fired. Production of the core, made of the expensive composite material, was on schedule for its completion to coincide with the finishing of the fully tested and debugged missile shell into which it was to be loaded. The launch date was set to be the following year\u0026rsquo;s New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, exactly twelve years after the project\u0026rsquo;s official inauguration. The best selling Christmas gift that year was a calendar that counted down the days to time zero, the proceeds going to the projectile project.\nThe king had undergone a personal transformation from his earlier frivolous and thoughtless self. He now spent as much time as he could in the laboratories and the manufacturing plants, encouraging the workers, and praising their toil. Sometimes he would bring a sleeping bag and spend the night on a noisy machine floor. He even studied and tried to understand the technical aspects of their work. Yet he confined himself to giving moral support and refrained from meddling in technical and managerial matters.\nSeven days before New Year, the woman who had made the case for the project almost twelve years earlier, and was now its chief executive, came to the royal castle and requested an urgent audience with the king. When the king got her note, he excused himself to the foreign dignitaries whom he was reluctantly entertaining at the annual Christmas dinner and hurried off to the private room where the scientist was waiting. As always of late, she looked pale and worn from her long working hours. This evening, however, the king also thought he could detect a ray of relief and satisfaction in her eyes.\nShe told him that the missile had been deployed, the core had been loaded, everything had been triple checked, they were ready to launch, and would the king give his final go ahead. The king sank down in an armchair and closed his eyes. He was thinking hard. By launching the projectile tonight, one week early, seven hundred thousand people would be saved. Yet if something went wrong, if it missed its target and hit the mountain instead, it would be a disaster. A new core would have to be constructed from scratch and the project would be set back by some four years. He sat there, silently, for almost an hour. Just as the scientist had become convinced that he had fallen asleep, he opened his eyes and said in a firm voice: \u0026ldquo;No. I want you to go right back to the lab. I want you to check and then recheck everything again.\u0026rdquo; The scientist could not help a sigh escaping her; but she nodded and left.\nThe last day of the year was cold and overcast, but there was no wind, which meant good launch conditions. The sun was setting. Technicians were scuttling around making the final adjustments and giving everything one last check. The king and his closest advisors were observing from a platform close to the launch pad. Further away, behind a fence, large numbers of the public had assembled to witness the great event. A large clock was showing the countdown: fifty minutes to go.\nAn advisor tapped the king on the shoulder and drew his attention to the fence. There was some tumult. Somebody had apparently jumped the fence and was running toward the platform where the king sat. Security quickly caught up with him. He was handcuffed and taken away. The king turned his attention back to the launch pad, and to the mountain in the background. In front of it, he could see the dark slumped profile of the dragon. It was eating.\nSome twenty minutes later, the king was surprised to see the handcuffed man reappearing a short distance from the platform. His nose was bleeding and he was accompanied by two security guards. The man appeared to be in frenzied state. When he spotted the king, he began shouting at the top of his lungs: \u0026ldquo;The last train! The last train! Stop the last train!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who is this young man?\u0026rdquo; said the king. \u0026ldquo;His face seems familiar, but I cannot quite place him. What does he want? Let him come up.\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation, and the reason for his frenzy was that he had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain. The king had ordered the train traffic to continue, fearing that any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and leave the open field in front of the mountain where it now spent most of its time. The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train, which was due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot do it,\u0026rdquo; said the king, \u0026ldquo;I cannot take the risk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the trains frequently run five minutes late. The dragon won\u0026rsquo;t notice! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was kneeling before the king, imploring him to save his father\u0026rsquo;s life and the lives of the other thousand passengers onboard that last train.\nThe king looked down at the pleading, bloodied face of the young man, but he bit his lip, and shook his head. The young man continued to wail even as the guards carried him off the platform: \u0026ldquo;Please! Stop the last train! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stood silent and motionless, until, after a while, the wailing suddenly ceased. The king looked up and glanced over at the countdown clock: five minutes remaining.\nFour minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.\nThe last technician left the launch pad.\n30 seconds. 20 seconds. Ten, nine, eight…\nAs a ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out, the spectators instinctively rose to the tips of their toes, and all eyes fixated at the front end of the white flame from the rocket\u0026rsquo;s afterburners, heading towards the distant mountain. The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, it was as if at this moment they shared a single awareness, a single conscious experience: that white flame, shooting into the dark, embodying the human spirit, its fear and its hope…striking at the heart of evil. The silhouette on the horizon tumbled, and fell. A thousand voices of pure joy rose from the assembled masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn out thud from the collapsing monster as if the Earth itself was drawing a sigh of relief. After centuries of oppression, humanity at last was free from the cruel tyranny of the dragon.\nThe joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant: \u0026ldquo;Long live the king! Long live us all!\u0026rdquo; The king\u0026rsquo;s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: \u0026ldquo;We did it! We did it!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king, however, answered in a broken voice: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late? This could have been done five, maybe ten years ago! Millions of people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had to die.\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stepped off the platform and walked up to the young man in handcuffs, who was sitting on the ground. There he fell down on his knees. \u0026ldquo;Forgive me! Oh my God, please forgive me!\u0026rdquo;\n Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.65 7 294.20 2023-11-23T20:33:42Z   back 2.80 7 294.20 2023-12-06T20:45:41Z    The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant\nBack A parable which contextualizes human death as something to be defeated.\nSource (Bostrom 2005)\nSource    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 256.21 2023-11-21T08:17:50Z    The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant\nBack Nick Bostrom\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Bostrom, N. 2005. “The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant.” Journal of Medical Ethics 31 (5): 273–77. https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2004.009035.

It may be trite to say you should Just Start or to Drop Unimportant Tasks; however, these simple truths are still true and I often forget them.\nNotes Skeleton Table of Contents Busy Person Patterns – An Introduction Just start  You have a task that cannot wait until you have all the information about it to begin. It may be time sensitive, you may have a deadline, or part of the task may be to identify its parts. Most important, you feel internal or external pressure to begin and have some level of confidence about the task\u0026rsquo;s overall direction.\n[Negatives]\n The initial information given with a task may not be conducive to understanding it immediately. Tasks may be vague in their definition. Just by starting a task, you do not guarantee that you can figure it out and complete it. You can waste time fumbling through starting the task without a clear idea what you need to do. While you are starting one task, you are putting off other tasks. Some organizations may punish initiative. You may be afraid to start.  [Positives]\n By not starting a task, you do not know whether you can complete it. If you do not start a task, you cannot complete it. Starting something new can be satisfying and give you a sense of accomplishment.  Therefore, when faced with a vague task, start working on it to see if the steps you need to complete it emerge.\n    Commentary\n Procrastination is the enemy of a busy person.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Contiguous time blocks Related: Deep work\n You have the information you need to complete a task and you are determining how you will complete it. You have several other tasks you need to complete and you frequently fragment your time. You feel that you must prevent interruptions to advance this task.\n[Negatives]\n Setting aside time does not guarantee it will not be interrupted. It is not always possible to obtain contiguous time blocks.  [Positives]\n Complex tasks require a certain amount of think time to be completed. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated. Smaller allocated time blocks create interruptions that cause you to stop and re-start a task.  Therefore, set aside a block of time to complete the task so that you are able to perform the task without interruption until you are comfortable with how the task is progressing.\n    Commentary\n This is a pattern about limiting interruptions so that you can concentrate on a complex task. Interruptions can come in at least two forms: Those you impose upon yourself through fragmenting your time and those that outside forces impose upon you. Even though there is a potential task re-start penalty when you impose interruptions upon yourself, there is a quantifiable task re-start consequence when outside influences interrupt you. When you interrupt yourself, you typically do it at a logical break point – a time when you feel comfortable you can stop the task. When outside influences cause an interruption, however, your concentration on a complex problem is broken and you need to re-establish it to continue.\n      Resulting Context\n Be careful not to take this pattern to an extreme. If you completely de-fragment your time, you will be unable to complete important tasks that may have an earlier due date because you will not interrupt yourself to address them.\n     Examples  Single-Task important items  You have a task to do that you and/or others consider important. Performing this task simultaneously with other tasks breaks your concentration and you find that quality is suffering. You feel that the task warrants a quality level that is impossible to produce if you perform it with other tasks.\n[Negatives]\n Interruptions are an unpleasant fact. It is often impossible to find time to work on only one thing because of pressure from others though in-person visits, email, IM, telephone calls, or pages. Single tasking does not guarantee that the results will be better than if you multitasked. When you perform a single task, you may be putting off tasks that are more important or time critical.  [Positives]\n Important tasks, like complex tasks, require a certain amount of think time to be completed. What makes an important task different from a complex task is there is a need to attend to details – the output is important. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated and produce work that is not befitting the task. Working on one important task may help you solve another complex problem. When you fragment your time by completing multiple tasks in the same time block, you decrease the amount of concentration and attention you can give to an important task. There is a certain level of satisfaction knowing that you are producing high quality results.  Therefore, isolate important tasks and perform them separately so that you have the ability to concentrate and produce high quality output in the required amount of time.\n    Commentary\n This pattern is different from Contiguous Time Blocks. Single-Task Important Items does not refer to blocking off time for a task, but refers to concentration on a single important task at a time.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Put it off  You have a task to complete and you are having trouble concentrating on it either because it is complex, you are fatigued, or it is large. You find that you are having difficulty advancing the task or that the task itself is becoming more confusing. Most important, you feel you do not have a good handle on how to organize the task, its output, or both.\n[Negatives]\n Procrastination can make a task more difficult to complete. When you are extremely fatigued, setting aside a task or sleeping may or may not help you organize your thoughts. It may not be possible to put it off certain tasks due to pressure to complete a task. Putting a task off might not result in a better organization or output.  [Positives]\n When you have trouble concentrating, the work you are trying to complete takes longer. When you have trouble concentrating, quality suffers. Complex (or boring) tasks drain your mental resources. Setting a problem aside gives your mind time to mull over the information it has already absorbed while you are doing other things. By better organizing a task or its output, it may become easier complete.  Therefore, when faced with poor concentration on a boring or complex task with a somewhat flexible deadline, stop working on it temporarily so you can collect your thoughts. It may help to sleep on the problem and begin working it anew once you awaken.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n If you put something off that will not benefit from downtime thinking, you are essentially procrastinating – an alternate, less appealing resulting context. In addition, it is possible for you to think you can put something down in order to organize your thoughts, but if there is no plan to return to it, it is probably procrastination.\n     Examples  Seek clarification  You have a task to complete which is vague or has vague instructions. The task may have an aggressive deadline. Just starting the task to learn its direction does not appear to be an option. Most significant, you feel that you cannot begin the task unless you have clear instructions or you obtain additional information.\n[Negatives]\n By requesting clarification, you could irritate the individual or organization giving the task (discretion and politeness is required). The time used to clarify a task may take away from the time you have to complete it. Some organizations view asking for help as a sign of weakness and discourage people from seeking clarification.  [Positives]\n When a timed task is vague, you need to determine what is truly required quickly. Vague tasks take a lot of time to figure out and you could be wrong if you guess. The amount of time taken to complete a vague task takes away from other tasks. Obtaining clarification may help you organize your thoughts and identify the information you require to complete it.  Therefore, ask the requestor for clarification so that you can focus on completing the task.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n Seeking clarification can backfire. This depends on the personality of the person who gives you the task and, in some cases, their power and authority. If the person giving a task believes you should know how to complete it, rather than gaining additional information to perform the task you will irritate them and perhaps lose their trust in your competence.\n     Examples  Batch the simple stuff  You have many tasks to complete and a number of them are relatively small. The tasks relate to each other. You have a sense that you are not making much progress and you have a block of time to invest in completing small, simple tasks.\n[Negative]\n If too much time is spent clearing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. The priority of small tasks may not let you batch them together. Small tasks may require input from others and not lend themselves to batching. Many small tasks can be similar to (or more complex than) a large task.  [Positive]\n Smaller tasks take less time to complete. Removing things from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Grouping similar small tasks into task groups may reduce the amount of total time required to complete them.  Therefore, when faced with many small tasks, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and an available block of time, batch these tasks together.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n Perhaps the most harmful alternative resulting context for this pattern is if you decide to batch simple stuff instead of completing larger and more important tasks. Though you may gain some satisfaction in completing these smaller items, when a task is unimportant, you should consider using a Task Jar instead.\n     Examples  Task jar  You have many tasks to complete and some of them are relatively small, well known, and not urgent. You also have several larger tasks, which require larger blocks of time or are complex. You do not have a block of time to complete these small tasks, but there is time available between other more important or larger tasks.\n[Negatives]\n If you dedicate too much time to completing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. Stopping large tasks to complete other smaller tasks can cause both to take longer. Simpler tasks may take more time than is available between larger or more complex  tasks.\n[Positives]\n Small tasks do not take a long time to complete. Removing items from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Using the time between tasks to complete other tasks can free your mind temporarily before you begin the next larger or more complex task. There is no advantage to doing small tasks together that do not have any affinity.  Therefore, when faced with many small non-urgent tasks that do not have any affinity, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and no dedicated block of time to complete them, intersperse simple tasks throughout the day in between larger or more complex tasks.\n    Commentary\n Tasks should be well known; no need to Seek Clarification Related:  Batch the Simple Stuff Drop Unimportant Tasks         Resulting Context\n Using a \u0026ldquo;task jar\u0026rdquo; allows you to intersperse small, well-known, non-urgent tasks between larger or more complex tasks.\n     Examples  Strike when you are hot  You have a task to do and need to progress through it quickly or make significant progress. You have times of the day when you feel you are more productive – times when you are at your intellectual, emotional, or physical best. To make significant progress or complete the task, you feel that you need to be at your best to maintain your focus..\n[Negatives]\n Other tasks or outside influences may interfere with your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time. \u0026ldquo;Hot\u0026rdquo; times can occur at bizarre hours (e.g. in the middle of the night) which, if used, can affect your performance afterward. Using your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time to complete small tasks may or may not be the best use of that time. You may not be able to control the schedule of a task so that you complete it when you are hot. Just because you are at your mental best does not mean you will be able to concentrate. You may not know when your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time is.  [Positives]\n Everyone has a time of day where they are at their intellectual, emotional, and physical best. Completing tasks when you are at your best can reduce the amount of time it takes to complete it. When you are at your best, you may be more efficient.  Therefore, when you have a need to move quickly through many smaller tasks or make significant progress on larger tasks, take advantage of the time of day when you are most productive by striking when you are hot.\n    Commentary\n This pattern has its basis in our human biology. People seem to have times of day (not all the same) that they are better at completing tasks than others. For some, it is several different times a day. It has been suggested that the frequency could be as much as every 90-110 minutes. The circadian rhythm is another such biological clock.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Feedback loop Related: Agile, Leo Babauta | Reset Ritual to Come Back to Focus\n You have a task and are unable to determine how long it will take to complete. You have the information you need to begin the task, but you believe there will be additional information requirements that may emerge as you perform the task. The task itself may be vague, but you do not require clarification. You feel that you need some knowledge of the task\u0026rsquo;s parts to determine how long it will take to complete.\n[Negatives]\n Setting a target does not mean you will achieve it. You may not correctly estimate the duration of a task and waste more time having to stop the task and pick it up again after you assess your results. Completing a portion of the task may not give you any information about other pieces of the task. Unknown duration tasks can be disconcerting.  [Positives]\n It is often easier to break tasks down into sub-tasks. Gathering information about how long it takes you to complete a step can give you valuable information on how long it will take to complete the next step (or the entire task). Completing a task in tight feedback cycles may improve the overall quality of the deliverable.  Therefore, when you are uncertain how long a task is going to take, set a target for how much you expect to complete by a certain time. By setting a target, you will give yourself a point in time where you can check your progress. When you reach the target, you can check the amount of work you completed and then adjust your timeline to reflect how long you are taking.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Prioritize Related: Drop Unimportant Tasks\n You have many tasks to complete. These tasks can be large and complex or small and simple. You have the information you need to decide which tasks are more important. Each task has a different level of importance to you or someone for whom you are completing it.\n[Negatives]\n Sometimes, seemingly unimportant tasks are important. Often tasks originate from many different people. It is difficult to obtain general agreement from them about the relative important of all of your tasks. You have to be the judge. Sometimes the relationship between someone else\u0026rsquo;s goals and a task you are completing is not obvious. Prioritizing your work may cause you to focus on things you think are important versus what others think are important.  [Positives]\n A task\u0026rsquo;s level of importance is somewhat dependent upon its proximity to completion (when it is due). Tasks typically have different levels of importance. Putting the most important tasks first ensures that high value tasks are given more attention than low value tasks.  Therefore, when you have several tasks with different levels of importance, prioritize the work from the most important task to the least important task. When you prioritize tasks, consider the importance of the person requesting the task; the due date of the task; the amount of time required to do the task; the relationship between the task and your goals; and the relationship between the task and the requestor\u0026rsquo;s goals. By ordering the tasks, you ensure that you do the most important tasks first.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Delegate  You have a task to do for which you may not have the specific domain expertise and do not have the time to complete. You have people reporting to you or who are willing to help you complete the task. Others may be able to perform the task equal to or better than you.\n[Negatives]\n People may resent you dumping your work on them. Delegating an important task involves a measure of risk. People may not complete the task within the quality and time parameters you set. However, it may be GOOD ENOUGH. You can spend more time explaining a task to someone than you would spend doing the task yourself.  [Positives]\n You cannot complete everything yourself. People are usually willing to help. When you are busy, you cannot complete every task assigned to you and may need to Drop Unimportant Tasks.  Therefore, when you are faced with a task that you are responsible to complete, but do not have specific domain expertise or time, but either have people reporting to you or have people that do have time, delegate the task. Never put off for tomorrow what you can have someone else do today.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Drop unimportant tasks  You have several tasks you need to complete. Some of these tasks are unimportant and may never need action. The task may have been on the bottom of your list of things to do for a very long time and may no longer be required. In addition, you may have had past experience with the requestor and can judge whether it is truly required or not.\n[Negatives]\n History is not always a guide as to whether someone will need the results of a task. Tasks that are unimportant to you may be very important to someone else. A seemingly unimportant task may be a test to see if you can handle more important tasks.  [Positives]\n Understanding busywork is an important component to determining whether to drop a task. Some tasks are just not worth doing (so do not do them).  Therefore, when you receive an unimportant task whose completion will make no difference to anyone, drop the task. This is not an opportunity for slacking. Use this when you are overwhelmed and you are sure that the task will make no difference to anyone. This often requires very detailed knowledge of another person\u0026rsquo;s needs.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Good enough  You have several tasks you need to complete. You know that not everything that you do has to be perfect. You recognize that the level of quality for a task can be reduced, and still satisfy the requestor. You may be spending time on things that add little value.\nThe best is the enemy of the good. (Voltaire, Dictionnaire Philosophique. Women, 1694-1778)\n  You may feel unsettled by not producing your best work.\n  Some people want to produce a perfect product every time.\n  Time spent perfecting something that does not require perfection is time that is lost to completing other tasks.\n  The requestor may expect perfect output even if the task does not warrant it.\n  Therefore, reduce the level of quality to a level that will satisfy the requestor and meet their expectations. You can then complete the task more quickly. That is, you work on the task only until it is good enough. Different task outputs require different levels of perfection depending on some objective criteria and the requestors' expectations. If a task does not require a high level of precision or quality, it may be possible to put just enough effort into it to complete it.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n Completing tasks so that they are \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; and satisfy the requestor allows you to devote time to those tasks that truly do need an element of perfection.\n     Examples  Acknowledgements About the Authors Appendix A: Pattern Language Reference Diagram Appendix B: Pattern Cross Reference Appendix C: Quick Access Table References Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 3.10 7 475.73 2024-10-26T08:40:42Z   back 2.65 7 263.95 2024-03-09T19:36:30Z    James F.

But I think there\u0026rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:\n You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune [Technologist] You are a maker. You build things for people to use  We self-select into communities of our peers based on these ideals. We use coded language to express these ideals to our peers.\nI think each group has its own conferences, and its own subreddits. Its own programming languages, heroes and its own villains.\n Notes Programming as applied mathematics   Source code: The source should read like poetry - dense, with very few lines of code needed to express an idea. Once understood, the terse program seems like a beautiful and obvious description of your program. It is more important that the source code is simple than the execution is simple or fast. High level languages are better than low level languages because they let you express your intent more clearly. Execution: How the program is executed by the computer is an implementation detail of the compiler. It is more important that the code is simple than the execution is fast. Correctness: A program is correct if it implements the spec exactly. The best programs use tools like Ada to formally prove correctness. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Beautiful code is more important than beautiful UI.     Most (arguably all) of the modern advancements in programming languages come from people in this camp. If you\u0026rsquo;ve used React to make a website, you should know that the model of immutability and expressing your view as a pure function from data to DOM came from functional programming. Actually, most modern language features are invented by people who think of programming as thought. Years (or decades) later, those features get copied into the more popular languages and get treated as new ideas.\n Programming as hardware hacking   Source code: The code should be clean, but clean code is less important than a clean execution. Low level languages are often better than high level languages because you can be more explicit about what the computer will do when it executes your code. (Thus you have more room to optimize). Execution: How the computer executes your code is paramount. Programming without thinking about execution is just begging for slow performance. Correctness: A program is correct if it runs the way you expect it to run, given normal parameters. Execution elegance is more important than correctness. And if a theoretical issue can\u0026rsquo;t happen in practice due to how the machine works, its not a real bug. A program must be adequately fast to be considered correct. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Its ok to let the constraints of the hardware guide the user experience.     To this community we owe almost all performance improvements in our computers, above and beyond what is demanded by customers. Nobody else cares about performance quite like people who think about the hardware all day. But if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about your computer as a machine, what greater ugliness can you inflict than pointless work?\n Programming as a tool to make things   Source code: The code should be clean, but only because cleaner code is easier to iterate on. Code cleanliness is less important than most other considerations. Execution: The program only has to be fast enough for the users. If you make it even faster, you\u0026rsquo;re taking time away from adding features that people care about more. Correctness: Bugs are bad only in proportion to their impact. The program should act the way the users expect it to act. UI: The UI is more important than anything else. Every other part of the program only exists in service to the user interface.     I think most professional software engineers are in this tribe - which makes sense, because this is the place where it is easiest to make money writing software.\nIn my experience people in this camp are better at community. They seem to be much more positive and encouraging of new members, and willing to help. I guess its because you can tell if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job in the other two camps by simply taking a look yourself. If you make software for other humans, satisfaction comes from making the people around you happy.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel that this place is a touch soulless. Taken to the extreme, this world view doesn\u0026rsquo;t value the beauty in the engineering itself. Although you could probably make the opposite criticism against the other groups - they don\u0026rsquo;t value how their software can impact the world.\n Also see Moloch.\nFlashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 7 232.94 2024-02-03T11:58:56Z   back 2.80 7 314.68 2024-05-28T06:01:43Z    Joseph Gentle | Three Tribes of Programming\nBack  Poets and mathematicians: Programming as applied mathematics Hackers: Programming as hardware hacking Makers: Programming as a tool to make things  Source (Gentle 2017)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 296.24 2024-03-28T20:24:42Z   back 2.35 7 177.62 2023-11-09T08:15:36Z    Programming as applied mathematics\nBack   Source code: The source should read like poetry - dense, with very few lines of code needed to express an idea.

This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?\nMoloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis' question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?\nAnd Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. \u0026ldquo;Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Goddess answers: \u0026ldquo;What is the matter with that, if it\u0026rsquo;s what you want to do?\u0026rdquo;\nMalaclypse: \u0026ldquo;But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!\u0026rdquo;\nGoddess: \u0026ldquo;Oh. Well, then stop.\u0026rdquo;\nThe implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: \u0026ldquo;Moloch\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful not because it\u0026rsquo;s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn\u0026rsquo;t an agent.\nBostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.\nSo you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don\u0026rsquo;t everyone else will kill you, because if they don\u0026rsquo;t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to \u0026ldquo;everyone agrees to stop doing this at once\u0026rdquo;, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.\n Examples Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma Fish farming story  As a thought experiment, let\u0026rsquo;s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.\nBut each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let\u0026rsquo;s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.\nA thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.\nBut one farmer (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.\nEveryone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he\u0026rsquo;s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.\nOnce four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying \u0026ldquo;Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone\u0026rsquo;s productivity goes down.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…\nA self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.\n Malthusian trap  Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you\u0026rsquo;re one of those rats from The Rats of NIMH).\nYou live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there\u0026rsquo;s not enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.\nA certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back will go extinct within a few generations.\nIn fact, it\u0026rsquo;s not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out, swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.\nIf some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island\u0026rsquo;s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop the cycle (a) will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating anything is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.\nFor a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.\n Capitalism  Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can\u0026rsquo;t, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\n Two-income trap  It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.\nFrom a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get one will be left behind.\n Agriculture II  A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t take it die out. Eventually, everyone\u0026rsquo;s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone\u0026rsquo;s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.\n Reference star wars \u0026ldquo;make the only choice we can\u0026rdquo; choice III  The Apocrypha Discordia says:\n\u0026ldquo;Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to be somewhere else when we reach the sea.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take this random gag 100% literally and see where it leads us.\nWe just analogized the flow of incentives to the flow of a river. The downhill trajectory is appropriate: the traps happen when you find an opportunity to trade off a useful value for greater competitiveness. Once everyone has it, the greater competitiveness brings you no joy – but the value is lost forever. Therefore, each step of the Poor Coordination Polka makes your life worse.\nBut not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move uphill surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons – excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization – plus one good reason – coordination.\n Excess resources (Moloch)  The ocean depths are a horrible place with little light, few resources, and various horrible organisms dedicated to eating or parasitizing one another. But every so often, a whale carcass falls to the bottom of the sea. More food than the organisms that find it could ever possibly want. There\u0026rsquo;s a brief period of miraculous plenty, while the couple of creatures that first encounter the whale feed like kings. Eventually more animals discover the carcass, the faster-breeding animals in the carcass multiply, the whale is gradually consumed, and everyone sighs and goes back to living in a Malthusian death-trap.\n Physical limitations (Moloch)  Imagine a profit-maximizing slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves' productivity dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor – we assume the fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can – but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how mean you can get away with being. Thus, the \u0026ldquo;race to the bottom\u0026rdquo; stops somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits are run into.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo in this case, a race to the bottom where competing plantations become crueler and crueler to their slaves in order to maximize competitiveness is halted by the physical limitation of cruelty not helping after a certain point.\n Utility maximization (Moloch)  We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking in terms of preserving values versus winning competitions, and expecting optimizing for the latter to destroy the former.\nBut many of the most important competitions / optimization processes in modern civilization are optimizing for human values. You win at capitalism partly by satisfying customers' values. You win at democracy partly by satisfying voters' values.\nSuppose there\u0026rsquo;s a coffee plantation somewhere in Ethiopia that employs Ethiopians to grow coffee beans that get sold to the United States. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s locked in a life-and-death struggle with other coffee plantations and want to throw as many values under the bus as it can to pick up a slight advantage.\nBut it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice quality of coffee produced too much, or else the Americans won\u0026rsquo;t buy it. And it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice wages or working conditions too much, or else the Ethiopians won\u0026rsquo;t work there. And in fact, part of its competition-optimization process is finding the best ways to attract workers and customers that it can, as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost them too much money. So this is very promising.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember exactly how fragile this beneficial equilibrium is.\nSuppose the coffee plantations discover a toxic pesticide that will increase their yield but make their customers sick. But their customers don\u0026rsquo;t know about the pesticide, and the government hasn\u0026rsquo;t caught up to regulating it yet. Now there\u0026rsquo;s a tiny uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;selling to Americans\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Americans' values\u0026rdquo;, and so of course Americans' values get thrown under the bus.\nOr suppose that there\u0026rsquo;s a baby boom in Ethiopia and suddenly there are five workers competing for each job. Now the company can afford to lower wages and implement cruel working conditions down to whatever the physical limits are. As soon as there\u0026rsquo;s an uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;getting Ethiopians to work here\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Ethiopian values\u0026rdquo;, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too good for Ethiopian values either.\nOr suppose someone invents a robot that can pick coffee better and cheaper than a human. The company fires all its laborers and throws them onto the street to die. As soon as the utility of the Ethiopians is no longer necessary for profit, all pressure to maintain it disappears.\nOr suppose that there is some important value that is neither a value of the employees or the customers. Maybe the coffee plantations are on the habitat of a rare tropical bird that environmentalist groups want to protect. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re on the ancestral burial ground of a tribe different from the one the plantation is employing, and they want it respected in some way. Maybe coffee growing contributes to global warming somehow. As long as it\u0026rsquo;s not a value that will prevent the average American from buying from them or the average Ethiopian from working for them, under the bus it goes.\nI know that \u0026ldquo;capitalists sometimes do bad things\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it\u0026rsquo;s not equivalent to \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo;. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they\u0026rsquo;re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter.\n(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very well and people who summarize him as \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo; are doing him a disservice)\n   And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it\u0026rsquo;s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there\u0026rsquo;s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus.\nFor example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling to do anything about them because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to look \u0026ldquo;soft on crime\u0026rdquo;, and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all over the airwaves as \u0026ldquo;Convict released by Congressman\u0026rsquo;s policies kills family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone claim he deserves reelection?\u0026rdquo;. So even if decreasing prison populations would be good policy – and it is – it will be very difficult to implement.\n(Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the stunned governments!)\n Coordination (Moloch) The opposite of a trap is a garden\n Things are easy to solve from a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse. An intense competition between agents has turned into a garden, with a single gardener dictating where everything should go and removing elements that do not conform to the pattern.\n   [\u0026hellip;] government can easily solve the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races within a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.\nThe two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there\u0026rsquo;s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.\n IV  So I agree with Robin Hanson: This is the dream time. This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and science and philosophy and love can flourish.\nAs technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus' unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.\n Contract Drafting Em\n The last value we have to sacrifice is being anything at all, having the lights on inside. With sufficient technology we will be \u0026ldquo;able\u0026rdquo; to give up even the final spark.\n(Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!)\nEverything the human race has worked for – all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future – might be accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.\n(Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!)\n   We will break our back lifting Moloch to Heaven, but unless something changes it will be his victory and not ours.\n VII  The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.\nAnd the whole point of Bostrom\u0026rsquo;s Superintelligence is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift something to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u0026rsquo;s on our side, it can kill Moloch dead.\nAnd if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to flourish unconstrained by natural law.\n VIII  The Universe is a dark [Dark forest theory] and foreboding place, suspended between alien deities. Cthulhu, Gnon, Moloch, call them what you will.\nSomewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names. In the Kushiel books, his name was Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans.\nThe other gods sit on their dark thrones and think \u0026ldquo;Ha ha, a god who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!\u0026rdquo;\nBut somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a surprising number of unfortunate accidents.\nThere are many gods, but this one is ours.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?\nMy answer is: Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.\nHe always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.\nAs long as the offer\u0026rsquo;s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.\n Flashcards Ways Scott Alexander sees for resisting Moloch    position ease box interval due     front 1.30 4 8.20 2023-07-11T05:59:34Z    Back  Excess resources Physical limitations Utility maximization Coordination  Source (Alexander 2014)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 322.76 2024-04-17T10:22:19Z   back 2.50 7 300.95 2024-04-12T14:27:20Z    Excess resources (Moloch)\nBack Moloch doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold as much power when there\u0026rsquo;s a surplus.\nSource (Alexander 2014)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.95 6 163.69 2023-08-13T08:29:08Z   back 2.50 7 285.41 2024-04-14T11:29:29Z    Physical limitations (Moloch)\nBack Moloch isn\u0026rsquo;t capable of compelling actors to violate the laws of physics.\nSource (Alexander 2014)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 7 303.27 2024-03-31T07:30:08Z   back 1.60 4 10.52 2023-08-02T16:23:05Z    Utility maximization (Moloch)\nBack Moloch can lead to a garden so long as the optimal strategy produces a garden.\nSource (Alexander 2014)\nDescribe    position ease box interval due     front 2.95 7 470.00 2024-11-05T03:53:24Z   back 2.65 7 303.58 2024-04-29T15:35:46Z    Coordination (Moloch)\nBack Only another god can defeat Moloch.

This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to go into every gruesome detail, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to couch your answer at the level you think they\u0026rsquo;ll understand and that you have time for, but they\u0026rsquo;re smarter than you probably think.\n Win the series  Every interaction is a repeated game, and your goal is not to win this one iteration, but to win the series. So if a child is crying because she wants something, even though it feels like a win to give in now (she stops crying which is better for everyone, you haven\u0026rsquo;t really given up much), it\u0026rsquo;s disastrous in the repeated game because she learns that she can get what she wants by crying.\n Never bluff  If you threaten a consequence and don\u0026rsquo;t follow through, they\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out really quickly. Which leads to the following rule: be very careful with threats. If you make them, carry them out; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to carry out the threat, don\u0026rsquo;t make it.\n Praise the process  We\u0026rsquo;re pretty particular in how we praise our kids. We try to use process praise (\u0026ldquo;I like the way you made up a story about all the parts of your drawing\u0026rdquo;), some amount of results praise (\u0026ldquo;That block tower is amazing! It\u0026rsquo;s so tall!\u0026quot;), and virtually zero person praise (\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a good artist/architect.\u0026quot;)\n Answer questions with as much detail as they want  I\u0026rsquo;ve had conversations with the kids about civil rights, affirmative action, religion, communism versus capitalism, consequences for breaking laws, race, sexuality, and so on. Not because I\u0026rsquo;ve set out to teach them that stuff, but because they ask lots of questions and I try to answer them. Kids are mostly concerned with concrete, day-to-day things \u0026ndash; but some of the best interactions come when they are in the right questioning mood, and you definitely want to take advantage of it.\nYou have to be age appropriate \u0026ndash; when talking about where babies come from, I don\u0026rsquo;t talk about penises in vaginas to a 5 year old \u0026ndash; but they can handle a lot more than most adults give them credit for.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Orr, Dave. n.d. “Parenting Rules.” Accessed March 14, 2022. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gapy2nLy4wysXSGL/parenting-rules.

For instance, Greenwald mentioned a scene in a hospital in which a nurse inflating a blood-pressure cuff originally said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to blow this up.\u0026rdquo; Greenwald recalls: \u0026ldquo;Fred made us redub the line, saying, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to puff this up with some air,\u0026rsquo; because \u0026lsquo;blow it up\u0026rsquo; might sound like there\u0026rsquo;s an explosion, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.\u0026rdquo;\nThe show\u0026rsquo;s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn\u0026rsquo;t air. And Rogers\u0026rsquo;s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet \u0026ldquo;to sleep,\u0026rdquo; he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.\nRogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children\u0026rsquo;s minds might go. For instance, in a scene in which an eye doctor uses an ophthalmoscope to peer into his eyes, he made a point of having the doctor clarify that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see Rogers\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. Rogers also wrote a song called \u0026ldquo;You Can Never Go Down the Drain,\u0026rdquo; because he knew that drains were something that, to kids, seemed to exist solely to suck things down.\n(King 2018)\n   In 1977, about a decade into the show\u0026rsquo;s run, Arthur Greenwald and another writer named Barry Head cracked open a bottle of scotch while on a break, and coined the term Freddish. They later created an illustrated manual called \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Talk About Freddish,\u0026rdquo; a loving parody of the demanding process of getting all the words just right for Rogers. \u0026ldquo;What Fred understood and was very direct and articulate about was that the inner life of children was deadly serious to them,\u0026rdquo; Greenwald said.\nPer the pamphlet, there were nine steps for translating into Freddish:\n \u0026ldquo;State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms preschoolers can understand.\u0026rdquo; Example: It is dangerous to play in the street. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase in a positive manner,\u0026rdquo; as in It is good to play where it is safe. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.\u0026rdquo; As in, \u0026ldquo;Ask your parents where it is safe to play.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive.\u0026rdquo; In the example, that\u0026rsquo;d mean getting rid of \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo;: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;d be \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo;: Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.\u0026rdquo; Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow your advice.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; represents a value judgment, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea a ﬁnal time, relating it to some phase of development a preschooler can understand.\u0026rdquo; Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them, and listening is an important part of growing.

The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.\nBlack proposes converting work to play. I wonder: will all games have players?\n Even if we assume that all work could be gamified, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that everyone will want to play such games. I love games, and have spent way too much of my life playing them, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gone months and years without playing any games at all, and don\u0026rsquo;t see how being forced to play a game would be any better than being forced to work.\nAlso, its difficult to imagine how the most undesirable of jobs could be gamified. Who\u0026rsquo;s going to want to play the garbageman game? Or the fix the sewage system game?\nThe products and services of our modern world also requires sustained, multi-year efforts by trained specialists. Something like the mass production of medicine isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can just play with once in a while and still get it made in high enough quantities with serious quality control.\n(pmoriarty n.d.)\n Perhaps the answer is just more automation.\nNotes  The alternative to work isn\u0026rsquo;t just idleness. To be ludic is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it\u0026rsquo;s never more rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called \u0026ldquo;leisure\u0026rdquo;; far from it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.\n The Carrot is the Stick\n Many workers are fed up with work. There are high and rising rates of absenteeism, turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread among workers themselves is that work itself is inevitable and necessary.\nI disagree. It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand — and I think this is the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure — we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make them less enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.\n   Under a system of permanent revelry, we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put the Renaissance to shame. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any more jobs, just things to do and people to do them.\n   Bear in mind that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take today\u0026rsquo;s work just as we find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would have to be perverse indeed. If technology has a role in all this it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new realms for re/creation.\n   Workers of the world\u0026hellip; relax!\n   Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren\u0026rsquo;t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.\nAnd so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Black, Bob. n.d. “The Abolition of Work.” The Anarchist Library.

I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that\u0026rsquo;s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.\n   In short, if you\u0026rsquo;re in search of generalizable knowledge that compounds exponentially over time, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.\nBut for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. Computers can be understood—even if it\u0026rsquo;s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\n   The most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through pip install first.\u0026quot; (a) If you know how Git\u0026rsquo;s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.\n   Blub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you\u0026rsquo;re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system\u0026rsquo;s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles [Learn things with a long shelf-life].\n   Once, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used user.name (the name field of an object stored in the user variable) instead of User.name (the name field of the class User) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; by which User.name was an instance of Column while user.name was a simple str. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python\u0026rsquo;s descriptor protocol (a) to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked\u0026mdash;and I realized that Python\u0026rsquo;s __dunder__ methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIf you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to look things up to figure out how they\u0026rsquo;re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM works under the hood. That\u0026rsquo;s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you\u0026rsquo;ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.\n   Because of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your \u0026ldquo;blub flywheel\u0026rdquo;—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I\u0026rsquo;m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to go deeper than necessary. If I really want to ship something, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out why that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I\u0026rsquo;ll bias against \u0026ldquo;guess-and-check\u0026rdquo; style debugging in favor of getting a better understanding of the system I\u0026rsquo;m trying to debug. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always feel worth it to, e.g., dive into the docs of tcpdump and iptables rules to track down my weird one-off networking issue—but over time I\u0026rsquo;ve run into enough \u0026ldquo;weird one-off networking issues\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s paid off many times over.\nThe second part of my blub flywheel is to pay attention to magic. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;m working with something new, I try to continuously update my best-guess mental model of how it\u0026rsquo;s implemented. \u0026ldquo;Okay, the docs are telling me to create an Ingress, I guess this is probably the widget that provisions a load balancer to talk to my backend containers?\u0026rdquo; If I realize I\u0026rsquo;m wrong, I\u0026rsquo;ll dig in and update. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I can\u0026rsquo;t ping those pods from outside the cluster, so how could the load balancer be talking to them? Aha—it\u0026rsquo;s talking to the nodes, and there\u0026rsquo;s a NodePort Service as a second layer of indirection.\u0026rdquo; If I have no idea at all how something could work, that usually means it\u0026rsquo;s time to read a book.\n Flashcards See Blub studies\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Kuhn, Ben. n.d. “In Defense of Blub Studies.” Benkuhn.Net.

Things that appear simple are often only simple on the surface and get \u0026ldquo;fiddly\u0026rdquo; if you go deeper. Salvatier proposes that this is a consistent property of the universe and isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to particular domains (i.e. programming, woodworking, physics, etc).\nThese details are difficult to identify since they are mostly-invisible before and after you notice them. Before you notice them you\u0026rsquo;re unaware of their existance, and afterward you\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated them into your Mental models so well as to make them disappear again! This makes it difficult to guide others past the snags you encountered.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] it\u0026rsquo;s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you\u0026rsquo;re new [\u0026hellip;]\n   Consider the boiling of water. That\u0026rsquo;s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?\nWell the stairs seemed simple too, so let\u0026rsquo;s double check.\nPut yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800\u0026rsquo;s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.\nGo to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.\n(I suggest actually doing this)\nThe first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water\u0026rsquo;s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem \u0026lsquo;unboiling\u0026rsquo;. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really look like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.\nTo make matters worse, if you\u0026rsquo;d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you\u0026rsquo;d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.\nWorse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement \u0026lsquo;water boils at 100 °C\u0026rsquo;.\nIt turns out that \u0026lsquo;boiling\u0026rsquo; is a lot more complicated than you thought.\nThis surprising amount of detail is is not limited to \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;complicated\u0026rdquo; domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.\n   It\u0026rsquo;s tempting to think \u0026lsquo;So what?\u0026rsquo; and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they are specific to stair carpentry; that\u0026rsquo;s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is not specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.\nYou can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself \u0026lsquo;man, it was so simple all along, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I had so much trouble\u0026rsquo;. [When people are naturally good at something] We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.\n   The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.\nYou might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. [\u0026hellip;]\nYou might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren\u0026rsquo;t automatically visible, even when you\u0026rsquo;re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead.\n   Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing different details [Theory of mind]. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16' long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, \u0026lsquo;no, no, no, let\u0026rsquo;s just trace it\u0026rsquo;, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.\nI kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don\u0026rsquo;t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard \u0026lsquo;let\u0026rsquo;s draw some diagrams and compute the angle\u0026rsquo; and didn\u0026rsquo;t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don\u0026rsquo;t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.\n   Before you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to put your attention on them because you don\u0026rsquo;t even know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. But after you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you\u0026rsquo;re good at?\nThis means it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important [Metacognition, Scout mindset, Growth mindset].\n   This problem is not easy to fix, but it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible either. I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world [Draw the rest of the owl]. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn\u0026rsquo;t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.\nIf you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.\n Flashcards Cloze    position ease box interval due     0 2.35 6 85.01 2023-07-24T18:53:39Z     If you wish to not get stuck, {{seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived}@0}.\n Source (Salvatier n.d.)\nSummarize    position ease box interval due     front 2.50 6 84.35 2023-07-27T05:59:38Z   back 2.65 6 113.04 2023-09-09T17:24:46Z    John Salvatier | Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail\nBack  The more difficult, complex, etc, your goal, the more details there will be for which understanding them is critical to success Everything is \u0026ldquo;fiddly\u0026rdquo; in that there are oddities and surprising details It\u0026rsquo;s difficult-to-impossible to retroactively identify the things that didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense when you were first learning a concept People perceive different details in a problem  Source (Salvatier n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Salvatier, John. n.d. “Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail.” Accessed March 12, 2022. http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail.

Since one of those choices was the CompUSA around the block from us, my co-worker brought it there. And waited. And waited. And was told they were waiting for the part. We called the Apple store who said that they could do most repairs in 24 hours. The question was, \u0026ldquo;How do we get it back?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to a CompUSA on the east-coast, you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realize that they are PC-centric and the Macs are nearly non-existent. We only brought it there because it was so close and, gosh, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Apple have some way to certify that a CompUSA has qualified repair people and a good stash of spares before it would list that particular location? I mean, this is Apple, right? The best quality around? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that quality extend to their partners?\nSo my co-worker went to the CompUSA and asked if the repair was done. The guy went to the back room, then came out. \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case, I want it back.\u0026rdquo;\nThe repair person got very defensive. \u0026ldquo;Why do you want it back? It\u0026rsquo;s not working! What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\nMy co-worker, in a shining moment of brilliance realized that any kind of full disclosure would only result in an unproductive battle over the iMac that he could easily lose: possession is 9/10th of the law.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s taking too long\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d have to defend the assertion against a barrage of, \u0026ldquo;But we promise it will be only one more day\u0026rdquo; and other excuses.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m taking it to your competitor\u0026rdquo; then he\u0026rsquo;d have to suffer through someone defending his company\u0026rsquo;s honor (and profits) to defeat the request.\nBeing too honest wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help either. Saying \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re incompetent and I want to take it somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help the situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no cheese down that hole.\nThen he came up with the perfect answer: He shrugged his shoulders and said, \u0026ldquo;My boss wants it back.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the perfect answer. You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with it.\nIt can be said that the most effective communication is that that speaks in the audience\u0026rsquo;s terms. His answer said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a lacky just like you. Your boss is a jerk and gives you shit jobs to do, and I my boss is a jerk and gives me shit jobs. I\u0026rsquo;m just like you. Please, in the brotherhood of underpaid-lackeys-with-mean-bosses, just give it to me.\u0026rdquo;\nIt harkening back to mommy and daddy leaving you speechless as a child being told \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t have that candy because I said so\u0026rdquo; it disarms him. It turns the biggest repair shop bully into a crying, defenseless child.\nIt ends the argument because it says, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with me, I\u0026rsquo;m the messenger.\u0026rdquo;\nThe name for this technique is \u0026ldquo;playing dumb.\u0026rdquo; It is a technique that we geeks often forget. We geeks are smart. We get paid for being smart. We get paid for having all the answers. Someone once told me, \u0026ldquo;My value to the company is to be the guy that knows everything.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s us. We\u0026rsquo;re the smart people. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to not give a well-reasoned answer even when it won\u0026rsquo;t work.\n\u0026ldquo;My boss said so.\u0026rdquo; Short. Simple. It works.\nThe important thing is that we play dumb. You have to be pretty smart to do that.\n Flashcards Ask the right questions Give the right answers References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Limoncelli, Tom. n.d. “The Right Answer.” Accessed February 21, 2022. https://everythingsysadmin.com/2004/12/the-right-answer.html.

As it\u0026rsquo;s been said elsewhere, they \u0026ldquo;beg for the bad news.\u0026rdquo;\n Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived  Being able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multi-threaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes. Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and ego-boosting behavior send the message to other engineers (maybe tacitly) to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things. An engineer who is quick to call someone a moron is someone destined to stunt his or her career.\nThis also means that mature engineers have self-awareness when it comes to their communication. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer communicates perfectly, only that they have some notion about where they could be better, and continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how they\u0026rsquo;re doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it elsewhere, but I must emphasize the point more: the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.\n Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it  Avoiding responsibility for estimates is another way of saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure.\u0026rdquo; All businesses rely on estimates, and all engineers working on a project are involved in Joint Activity, which means that they have a responsibility to others to make themselves interpredictable. In general, mature engineers are comfortable with working within some nonzero amount of uncertainty and risk.\n Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know they do  This code looks good, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked other people to review it, and I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their feedback. Now: how long will it last before it\u0026rsquo;s rewritten? Once it\u0026rsquo;s in production, how will its execution affect resource usage? How much do I expect CPU/memory/disk/network to increase or decrease? Will others be able to understand this code? Am I making it as easy as I can for others to extend or introspect this work?\n Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work  Getting things done means doing things you might not be interested in. No matter how exciting or appealing a project is, there are always boring tasks. Tedious tasks. Tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title.\n Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them  They recognize that at some point, their individual contribution and potential cannot be exercised singularly. They recognize that there is only so much that can be produced by a single person, and the world\u0026rsquo;s best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers.\n Mature engineers understand the difference between mentorship and sponsorship, and develop a habit of the latter Allspaw distinguishes between \u0026ldquo;mentorship\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sponsorship\u0026rdquo;:\n Mentors face inward Sponsors face outward   Engineers who find that the visibility of their own work is increasing acknowledge that a fundamental of wielding influence in your local community (both inside and outside your organization) is developing and maintaining awareness of opportunities to sponsor those around them that would benefit. It is not a secret that the tech industry is seriously challenged when it comes to supporting underrepresented and/or marginalized groups.\nDeveloping this as a habit takes effort, but the benefits are multi-fold; the engineer sharpens their critical-thinking skills (\u0026ldquo;oh, what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about in this meeting would be a great opportunity for $NAME to work on…\u0026quot;) and the sponsored engineer has opportunities that they otherwise might not.\n   [\u0026hellip;] this instinct to mentor plays into the idea that those who are marginalized aren\u0026rsquo;t already skilled enough, smart enough, or ready for more responsibility or leadership.\nWhat members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice. They have to work extremely hard and be extremely good at what they do to combat the systemic privilege and unconscious bias at play in our work environments. They are consistently under-promoted and under-compensated for this work, even though it\u0026rsquo;s excellent work.\n Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions  They realize all engineering decisions, implementations, and designs exist within a spectrum; we do not live in a binary world. They can quickly point out contexts where one successful approach or solution could work and where it could not. They know that one cannot be both efficient and thorough at the same time (The ETTO Principle), that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.\nThey know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and are OK with that. They are comfortable with it because they strive to make the ideal and non-ideal in a design explicit. Later on in the lifecycle of a design, when the original design is not scaling anymore or needs to be replaced or rewritten, they can look back not with a perspective of how short-sighted those earlier decisions were, but instead say \u0026ldquo;yep, we made it this far with it and knew we\u0026rsquo;d have to extend or change it at some point. Looks like that time is now, let\u0026rsquo;s get to work!\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;]\n   The tl;dr on trade-offs is that everyone cuts corners, in every project. Immature engineers discover them in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them and recognize them as part of good engineering.\n Mature engineers don\u0026rsquo;t practice CYAE (\u0026ldquo;Cover Your Ass Engineering\u0026rdquo;)  An example of CYAE is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not my fault. They broke it, they used it wrong. I built it to spec, I can\u0026rsquo;t be held responsible for their mistakes or improper specification.\u0026rdquo;\n I disagree with this point. I consider a lot of the documentation and design work that a mature engineer does to be under the heading of CYA. I agree that mature engineers won\u0026rsquo;t seek to throw others under the bus. However, I also expect mature engineers to understand that others may not play by the same rules. I expect a mature engineer to, at least to some extent, play the game.\nMature engineers are empathetic  In complex projects, there are usually a number of stakeholders. In any project, the designers, product managers, operations engineers, developers, and business development folks all have goals and perspectives, and mature engineers realize that those goals and views may be different. They understand this so that they can navigate effectively in the work that they do. Being empathetic in this sense means having the ability to view the project from another person\u0026rsquo;s perspective and to take that into consideration into your own work.\n Mature engineers make grounded complaints  [\u0026hellip;] they express judgments based on empirical evidence and bring with those judgments options for solving the problem which they\u0026rsquo;ve identified. A great manager of mine said to never go to your boss with a complaint about anything without at least one (ideally more than one) suggestion for a solution. Even demonstrating that you\u0026rsquo;ve tried working the problem on your own and came up empty-handed is better than an empty complaint.\n Mature engineers are aware of cognitive biases  This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer needs to have a degree in psychology, but cognitive biases are what can limit the growth of an engineer\u0026rsquo;s career at a certain point. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re not aware of the details of how they appear or how these biases can be guarded against, most mature engineers I know have a level of self-awareness to at least recognize they (like everyone) are susceptible to them.\n The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming  Appropriate, even if old\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it referenced as coming from The Psychology of Computer Programming (a), written in 1971, but I don\u0026rsquo;t actually see it in the text. Regardless, here are The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming, found on @wyattdanger (a)\u0026rsquo;s blog post (a) on receiving advice from his dad:\n Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them early before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry. We can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on. You are not your code. Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found. Don\u0026rsquo;t take it personally when one is uncovered. (Allspaw note \u0026ndash; related: see below, number #10, and the points Theo made above.) No matter how much \u0026ldquo;karate\u0026rdquo; you know, someone else will always know more. Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it\u0026rsquo;s not needed. Don\u0026rsquo;t rewrite code without consultation. There\u0026rsquo;s a fine line between \u0026ldquo;fixing code\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rewriting code.\u0026rdquo; Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience. Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don\u0026rsquo;t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position. Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect \u0026ndash; so if you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat. Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don\u0026rsquo;t take revenge or say \u0026ldquo;I told you so.\u0026rdquo; Never make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry. Don\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026ldquo;the coder in the corner.\u0026quot; Don\u0026rsquo;t be the person in the dark office emerging only for soda. The coder in the corner is out of sight, out of touch, and out of control. This person has no voice in an open, collaborative environment. Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community. Critique code instead of people \u0026ndash; be kind to the coder, not to the code. As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc.   Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Allspaw, John. n.d. “On Being A Senior Engineer.” Kitchen Soap.

Technologist are: Startups use new technology because of their immaturity rather than despite it. Playing with new  \u0026ldquo;The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure.\u0026rdquo;    Notes  I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I\u0026rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people\u0026rsquo;s software.\nThe second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.\nThis was surprising because it seems so clearly against our own interest. In almost every case, companies fail because they build the wrong thing. Unless your customers are themselves engineers, I\u0026rsquo;m the wrong person to help with that. You want someone comfortable at the periphery of your system, who wants to learn about the competitive landscape, who wants to talk to customers. You want a product engineer.\nBut consider our standard interview questions: data structures, recursion, and computational complexity. It always feels a little strange when I see someone arguing that these don\u0026rsquo;t reflect \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; day-to-day software tasks; I write recursive functions all the time. But that\u0026rsquo;s a consequence of the abstraction; what might be a simple nested lookup on any specific datatype becomes recursion when you try to generalize over a set of possible datatypes.\nLikewise, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it argued that the difference between, say, O(log N) and O(N) isn\u0026rsquo;t important, because in practice N tends to be small enough. That may be true for some domains, maybe even most of them, but if you\u0026rsquo;re building a general-purpose tool you have to focus on the pathological cases.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut if we want to hire product engineers, what questions should we ask instead? It\u0026rsquo;s impractical, given the sprawling scope of our industry, to only consider candidates with prior experience in our exact product space. Likewise, it\u0026rsquo;s unrealistic to expect that we\u0026rsquo;d have expertise in a candidate\u0026rsquo;s prior product spaces. We lack a common vocabulary, a common understanding of the nuances that separate good design choices from middling ones.\nAnd so we continue to search for our keys under the streetlamp; they could be anywhere, but this is where the light is. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, the technologists we hire will also have all the other skills necessary to make humane, useful software.\nThis means that even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a technologist, you have to learn how to pretend. [Be what they expect you to be]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs many have pointed out, this is not a rational strategy for building a company. It is, however, a phenomenal way to train new technologists. Chesterton notwithstanding, the fastest way to learn why a fence exists is to tear it down and see what happens.\nSeen from this perspective, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem so irrational; most startups fail before reaching a scale that has any existential technical risks. The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure. If the startup fails, there\u0026rsquo;s no harm done. If the startup gets traction, the engineers can apply their newfound wisdom.\nThis means startups don\u0026rsquo;t adopt new technologies despite their immaturity, they adopt them because of that immaturity. This drives a constant churn of novelty and obsolescence, which amplifies the importance of a technologist\u0026rsquo;s skillset, which drives startups to adopt new technologies.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBy introducing abstraction into every problem we solve, we distance ourselves from how our work is ultimately used. We tell ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re in the business of building sharp knives; if we made them safer, they\u0026rsquo;d be useless for everything except spreading butter. We float above the the effects of what we\u0026rsquo;ve created, treating them as inexorable consequences of progress.\n Flashcards Summarize    position ease box interval due     front 1.75 8 147.91 2023-11-01T12:25:47Z    Zach Tellman | Trapped in the Technologist Factory\nBack  The software development industry, as a System, is designed to foster Technologists; people more focused on the tool than on the problem the tool solves  (Zach Tellman) Why startups adopt new technologies    position ease box interval due     front 2.35 7 190.53 2023-11-10T04:29:16Z     It\u0026rsquo;s a feature, not a bug Startups attract Technologist types Not despite their immaturity but rather because of their immaturity \u0026ldquo;The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure.\u0026rdquo;  Source (Tellman n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Trapped in the Technologist Factory.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/trapped-in-the-technologist-factory.html#fn:hbase.

They are not, for instance, just someone with ten years of experience. They are not just someone who maintains a popular open source project. They are not just someone who wrote the initial prototype for their company\u0026rsquo;s flagship product.\nInstead, senior engineers possess many disparate skills, the exact composition of which varies from author to author. These laundry lists are detailed, nuanced (a), and typically leave the reader feeling as if they have a long way to go.\nEmpirically, though, there are many people who have the title \u0026ldquo;senior engineer\u0026rdquo; who do not possess all these skills. Unless all of them can be explained by title inflation or poor management, this is a serious disconnect with reality. We have to treat these articles as aspirational: a description of the industry as it should be. For someone wanting to make a significant, recognized impact on their company, today, these articles are more distracting than helpful.\nSenior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company\u0026rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhere possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance. However, this is only possible if the problem space is well understood. Premature abstraction, in code or elsewhere, introduces risk. If the failure modes in production are poorly understood, volunteering for pager duty may be the only way to really help.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMost risks, especially where managed effectively, never come to pass. For this reason, it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to tell the difference between real risk and perceived risk. By the same token, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real impact and perceived impact. If a senior engineer identifies a significant risk, they have to be able to concisely explain and prioritize it for a non-expert audience.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nEvery company has different risks, and so every company expects something different from their senior engineers. An engineer who has spent the last five years making small, continuous improvements to the processes in a larger company may not enjoy or even understand the sort of role expected by a three person startup. The expectation that \u0026ldquo;senior\u0026rdquo; is a fungible title is both widespread and harmful, leading to unrealistic expectations from both engineers and companies.\n Flashcards (Zach Tellman) Senior engineers {{reduce risk}{what they do}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 2.80 5 40.36 2023-08-06T01:06:45Z    Source (Tellman n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Senior Engineers Reduce Risk.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/senior-engineers-reduce-risk.html.

My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore. His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.\nI recognized that he had a tendency towards self-aggrandizement (a) and awkward flattery of his readers (a), but at worst he seemed harmless. As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.\nRecently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore. He\u0026rsquo;s written (a) about the need to defend \u0026ldquo;moderates\u0026rdquo; from bullies on the \u0026ldquo;extreme left\u0026rdquo;, asserted (a) that \u0026ldquo;the truth is to the right of the median\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;the left is culturally dominant,\u0026rdquo; and justified (a) Coinbase\u0026rsquo;s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed \u0026ldquo;political\u0026rdquo; by saying that it \u0026ldquo;will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.\u0026rdquo;\nI went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something. It turned out that I had. There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design. In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut Graham\u0026rsquo;s analysis of brevity, and indeed of all language design, was fundamentally unserious. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in a rigorous definition of brevity, because the ultimate measure of a language\u0026rsquo;s quality was still his hacker\u0026rsquo;s radar. All of his essays, and Arc itself, were just spokes around that central hub. If his essays sometimes disagreed, or if Arc didn\u0026rsquo;t reflect his essays, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly surprising; their only connection was they all, in the moment, seemed right and true to Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMichael Polanyi coined the term \u0026ldquo;Tacit knowledge\u0026rdquo; to describe something we only understand as part of something else. When we speak, for instance, we don\u0026rsquo;t focus on the sounds we\u0026rsquo;re making, we focus on our words. We understand how to speak, but would struggle to explain it. Tacit knowledge comprises the vast majority of what we know; we rely on it constantly.\nWhen that knowledge begins to lead us astray, however, Polanyi tells us we that must delve into it. We must make it explicit [Make implicit knowledge explicit]. An explicit understanding of speech might be necessary for someone with a speech impediment, but also for a professional performer; to be at the top of your field, it\u0026rsquo;s almost always necessary to transform innate talent into something more.\nA rare exception to this rule is the chicken sexer, who can quickly and accurately determine whether a day-old chick is male or female. The two are indistinguishable to most, but an expert can classify a thousand chicks an hour with 98% accuracy. The knowledge underpinning this expertise has never been made explicit; a trainee is simply corrected by an expert, over and over, until their intuition is equally refined.\nHeld to this standard, however, we all fall short. No one\u0026rsquo;s sensibilities about software design are so refined that they can teach simply through demonstration. We have to distill our intuition down to principles, and let those principles guide us beyond the bounds of our intuition. Anything less is just rentier pedagogy; maxims stripped of any context, whose true meaning within a given situation can only be judged by a single person.\nThis is the essence of modern \u0026ldquo;thought leadership\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s served Graham well. His essays on language design, as well as a few on startups, brought in the first entrepreneurs to his fledgling VC fund. People applied to YCombinator because they wanted Graham to apply his intuition to their problems.\nGraham\u0026rsquo;s essays on startups were much the same as his essays on language design, but they served a different purpose. They were marketing content, and in that role they excelled. They tantalized the reader by reducing complex problems down to singular, nebulous concepts. They hinted at deep insights that were just out of reach. They made people want to be in the same room as Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA recurring theme in his essays, both before (a) and after (a) his time at YCombinator, is conformity. Graham is resolutely on the side of the non-conformist, repeatedly tracing their lineage back to Galileo\u0026rsquo;s insistence that the earth moves (a), even after the church had forced him to recant.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGraham writes \u0026ldquo;the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \u0026lsquo;Eppur si muove,\u0026rdquo; but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t pause to consider that it is also \u0026ldquo;EARTH HAS 4 CORNER SIMULTANEOUS 4-DAY TIME CUBE\u0026rdquo; (a) and, more worryingly, \u0026ldquo;Jews will not replace us\u0026rdquo; (a). His model exists largely so he can focus on the one quadrant he finds interesting, but even that is a proxy for a much smaller group, the moral and intellectual heirs of Galileo, the people he intuits to be his peers. Graham doesn\u0026rsquo;t work through the consequences of his own model because the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; what matters is sharing some things that feel right and true.\nThis is all to say that Paul Graham is an effective marketer and practitioner, but a profoundly unserious public intellectual. His attempts to grapple with the major issues of the present, especially as they intersect with his personal legacy, are so mired in intuition and incuriosity that they\u0026rsquo;re at best a distraction, and worst a real obstacle to understanding our paths forward.\n Flashcards Compare and contrast    position ease box interval due     front 2.05 7 150.93 2023-10-01T20:09:55Z    Thought leaders and chicken sexers (Zach Tellman)\nBack  Thought leaders: Explicit knowledge Chicken sexers: Implicit knowledge  Source (Tellman n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Thought Leaders and Chicken Sexers.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/thought-leaders-and-chicken-sexers.html.

And now\u0026hellip; it lives in your \u0026ldquo;sent\u0026rdquo; folder, and briefly in the impression on your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s mind. The effort accumulates only insofar as that work subtly influences your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s thinking over time.\nLikewise, Most people take only transient notes (a), though with effective practices, they\u0026rsquo;re an essential foundation; see Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work (a).\nWe should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time.\nA Spaced repetition memory system (a) achieves this for memory: when you find information useful, you can invest a little effort to make sure you always have it available. Over time, one\u0026rsquo;s spaced repetition library accumulates thousands of questions, and (I strongly suspect) that knowledge makes it easier to be an effective knowledge worker later.\nHamming illustrates this point vividly:\n\u0026ldquo;You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.\u0026rdquo; [Do things that compound] Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime.

The goal for this writing session is only to get them down and out of my head. They are listed in no particular order.\n Only work on things that matter. Things that matter can be defended and argued to others; ideally with hard numbers. Be cautious about investing into projects that cannot be argued with numbers. Taking a closer look at the numbers around search keyboard usage may have led me to invest less in a technically complex keyboard solution (Kabu). Verify assumptions/expectations as early as possible. Get an experiment out there to confirm the things you think will happen as soon as possible. What is the minimum viable product? Build that and send it out. Confirm, with numbers, that the thing you want to build is worth building. Write your assumptions down throughout the duration of the project, especially at the beginning, and track them. How and when will you test them? Under promise and over deliver. Pad estimates. Be cautious when agreeing to deadlines. The unexpected always happens. Break projects down. Then break them down more. Trim all of the fat and get to MVP as soon as you can. From there, ensure steady and meaningful deliverables. Coding should be more typing than thinking. Design a solution away from the computer, then return and type it up. Document everything. Specifically, document what you do and the status of your projects. You\u0026rsquo;ll forget more than you ever know so write it down. I have come to like this process: write down the important things you do on a daily basis, summarize those at the end of the week, summarize those every month. Then, in addition to those notes, keep a set of notes specific to each project you\u0026rsquo;re working on. These project notes should include an up-to-date-at-all-times timeline of events and should include references to everything related to the project. This is more than you would ever send to someone but that\u0026rsquo;s not what it is for. This document is the bible for the project. It\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll pull from whenever you\u0026rsquo;re asked any question about the project from now until the end of time. Put time on your calendar to keep these documents up to date. Communicate regularly with stakeholders. Keep in mind that your audience dictates the way you present information. I\u0026rsquo;ve found through trial and error that a bi-weekly update is sufficient for most projects. More often than that and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to make meaningful progress enough to make the update worthwhile to write. That said, it may be useful to send something brief to your immediate team every week, or update them in a meeting. Communicate delays or other changes to the plan as early as possible.  Taken from my Keep notepad:\n Reach out to other teams before your invest time and effort to be sure they haven\u0026rsquo;t already fixed the problem Find a single point of contact (tl, etc) on collaborating teams. Send them docs for easily review. Proactively communicate. It\u0026rsquo;s your job to surface things and ask questions, it\u0026rsquo;s not their job to think of your questions for you. Or, rather, you can\u0026rsquo;t assume they will do you should act like they won\u0026rsquo;t. Don\u0026rsquo;t enter into a project without a good understanding of the benefits in a numeric sense. Kabu is, potentially, a massive 5 quarter long project which will introduce additional download times for our users and provide little in tangible benefits. Communicate especially when you feel too stressed to communicate. Take notes and document especially when you feel like there\u0026rsquo;s no time to. Adhere to all the good engineering habits especially when you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ll get them first thing on Monday when you get back. When feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to go for a quick walk and when you\u0026rsquo;re done with the walk write down the things that need to be done. Now that it certain down, does it feel as overwhelming? Is there any way to shorten the list by making concessions or cutting features? Can you reach out to anybody on the team to help you prioritize the list?  Taken from another Keep note:\n How much mayonnaise is in the jar? Meaning, to borrow another saying, how large is the market. The same hour of effort has different results based on the project it\u0026rsquo;s applied to. Understand what the payout stands to be for anything you\u0026rsquo;re working on. Think about your project from the perspective of an l7 who couldn\u0026rsquo;t give less of a shit. Can you convince them, with something concrete, to give a shit about the project? Rapid iteration beats coding in a tower for 6 months. Get to experiment quickly with a hack to prove that the real version is worth the effort. Think metrics first. Write up a step by step guide to evaluating projects and working on them. Include this shit so I won\u0026rsquo;t forget it again.  Taken from a Keep note:\n Thoroughly reviewing existing code when coming into extend an existing project. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s bug free. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s written well. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume the engineers who wrote it adhered to best practices or designed it in an extensible way. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume there are tests of any kind (unit, integration, end-to-end).  Prioritize Deep work\nI realized when writing this that the whole lot of it is the same as what\u0026rsquo;s posted all over the internet. The only difference is that these words mean more to me because I bled to learn them. It makes me wonder how much value there really is in seeking out advice online.\n2019-08-20\n Only work on things that have buy in from L+1, ideally L+2 or L+3. Things that higher ups are going to be judged against are going to be the things that they are motivated to invest in. Ideally, they\u0026rsquo;re success should depend on your success. This will ensure they make sure you succeed without you needing to do extra maneuvering. I cannot work in a silo for too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely weary of letting it run too long.

I thought about this in the context of citations needed episode 166. They discuss education specifically. It\u0026rsquo;s propagandisement as a great equalizer. Pursuing an education is a fantastic individual strategy to increase earning potential. However, systemically, one cannot say that everything can be solved by giving people more education. That is definitely part of a solution. More education is a great thing after all. However, the episode focuses on the rhetoric around providing education as a panacea against poverty, where it is one of many things that need to be done to alleviate poverty. It is the twisting of something that\u0026rsquo;s a great idea for an individual, however, is not wholly representative of a good systemic strategy.

Spqr Both sides have merit aka teach both sides  A phrase I see brought to bear more and more, and overwhelmingly regarding culture war topics. The big one, in my mind at least, used to be creationism and the Big Bang – that schools should teach both as equally powerful and correct. Often wrong; only one side has merit. Though not a phase at the time I first heard the phrase, the underlying rationale maps cleanly onto \u0026ldquo;alternative facts\u0026rdquo;. Cultural matters aren\u0026rsquo;t math insofar as there isn\u0026rsquo;t an objective right answer. We live in a cold universe after all. However, we can make our part of the universe warm (related, moloch and gardens). We can decide that slavery (yes I\u0026rsquo;m going for the emotionally resonant examples because I find that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re used with most often) is abhorrent. Related to \u0026ldquo;This is a matter for the states\u0026rdquo; only when a nation-wide federal/judicial-level policy isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Related to \u0026ldquo;The science/jury is still out\u0026rdquo;; we\u0026rsquo;re right, so if the evidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t bear that out then we clearly aren\u0026rsquo;t fine collecting evidence and arguing – especially arguing.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair (a) Carpe futura Level order search The word bear derives from a term that we think was used in the style of Voldemort to talk about a thing without using its true name; honey eaters Odd finding have rotational symmetry Even functions have mirror symmetry Avg(v) = 1/n * 1 t v Python list indexing cloze for names [start🔚step] P(A U B) equivalence Centering matrix equivalence Suspend Name to Letter NATO phonetic alphabet What is the determinant?

Partly because the employee could go elsewhere for that kind of thing because it is now in Vogue. However, it is in Vogue because a happy employee who identifies with the company who is spiritually fulfilled produce more than employees who lack these things. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t a small magnifying effect. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge magnifying effect. The employees, the knowledge workers, are the asset of the company. Maintaining their mental and spiritual health is the new form of mechanization or offshoring.

It overlaps well with my own Style Guide.\nNotes Introduction  Why write nonfiction?\n[\u0026hellip;]\n  Gain leverage\nKeeping thoughts to yourself can be a disservice to the world. If you have something important to say and you say it well, you send strangers down paths badly needed.\nWriting is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch.\n  Clarity of thought\nWriting is a laxative for the mind. When you write, your brain can\u0026rsquo;t stop itself from drawing connections between ideas—and exploring their implications. This shines a light on broken logic, which helps you gain clarity of thought.\nWriting is the act of thinking clearly with the help of paper. Writing slows down your thinking so you can play with your ideas.\n  Human connection\nThe most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet.\nIf you do interesting things then write about them publicly with an authentic voice, like-minded people want to meet the person behind that voice. Writing is a bat signal for your people.\n  (Shapiro n.d.-a), formatting mine\n What to Write About Choose your topic  A novel idea is one that\u0026rsquo;s not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and worthwhile. I\u0026rsquo;ve identified five categories:\n Counter-intuitive — \u0026ldquo;Oh, I never realized the world worked that way.\u0026rdquo; Counter-narrative — \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s not how I was told the world worked!\u0026rdquo; Shock and awe — \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s crazy. I would have never believed it.\u0026rdquo; Elegant articulations — \u0026ldquo;Beautiful. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have said it better myself.\u0026rdquo; Make someone feel seen — \u0026ldquo;Yes! That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I feel!\u0026rdquo;  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n   Your objective clarifies what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish, and your motivation ensures you actually see it through.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all that\u0026rsquo;s needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles.\nIf the right objective and motivation combo isn\u0026rsquo;t coming right away, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what\u0026rsquo;s in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light.\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Write an intro  I define an intro as the minimal information necessary to:\n Introduce the breadth of the post\u0026rsquo;s contents so that readers can decide if it\u0026rsquo;s for them. Hook readers into reading more.  It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you hook readers, so long as you eventually fulfill the hook.\nA hook is not a gimmick. It\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental psychological principle: A great intro—like an electrifying opening to a film—buys goodwill with readers. Buy enough goodwill and readers look past the weaker parts of your post—because they\u0026rsquo;re chasing the high from your great opening.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA hook is a half-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer:\n Questions — Pose an intriguing question, but don\u0026rsquo;t give the full answer. Narratives — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion. Research — Highlight research findings, but only a small portion. Arguments — Make an unexpected claim, but don\u0026rsquo;t explain how it\u0026rsquo;s true.  Hooks serve two purposes:\n They compel readers to continue reading. They switch on the storytelling machinery in readers' heads. They help you identify what\u0026rsquo;s interesting—novel—to write about.  In a nonfiction essay that explores new ideas, an effective intro often follows this structure:\n Establish shared context. Surface a problem and what\u0026rsquo;s at stake. Explore the problem\u0026rsquo;s significance. Tease a clever solution.  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Combat skepticism  In your intro, consider proactively countering any major skepticisms that exist. There are five types of skepticism to counter:\n  Superficial: Superficial skepticism emerges from readers not believing you\u0026rsquo;ll share things they don\u0026rsquo;t already know.\nSolution: Tease your original insights in your introduction.‍\n  Irrelevant: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll cover key points they care about.\nSolution: List the points you\u0026rsquo;ll cover.‍\n  Sloppy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want to sit through bad writing.\nSolution: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.‍\n  Implausible: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll deliver on your hooks.\nSolution: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.\n  Untrustworthy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re qualified to write about this.\nSolution: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can\u0026rsquo;t help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they believe you. Or, if you\u0026rsquo;re indeed unqualified, be upfront about it and frame the post as an exploratory journey you\u0026rsquo;re taking them on.\n  If you successfully hook readers while neutralizing their skepticism, you generate goodwill: now they\u0026rsquo;re invested in reading the rest of your post.\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Integrate feedback See also Collaborate for better results.\n My favorite writing trick is to only write my introduction then ask friends who represent my audience this question:\n\u0026ldquo;After reading only this intro, what are the most interesting ideas I could possibly cover in the rest of the post?\u0026rdquo;\nI pick and choose the responses that resonate with me. This is how I de-risk my post from lacking novelty: Am I headed in a direction that\u0026rsquo;s maximally interesting?\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n   The elements of a great intro\n[\u0026hellip;]\n It\u0026rsquo;s a compelling hook into your topic. Readers sense forthcoming novelty. It conveys the importance of the idea so that readers want to hear the rest of the story. It twisted the knife enough to help readers feel the pain you\u0026rsquo;re speaking to. It\u0026rsquo;s concise. Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want all the details; they want the minimum needed to be teased by your novelty in a way that resonates.  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Writing First Drafts  You\u0026rsquo;re a proxy for your die-hard readers.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the irony of self-indulgent writing: writing for yourself is the quickest path to writing something others love.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   The mistake writers make is believing expertise is required to write compelling nonfiction. Nope, it\u0026rsquo;s the rabid desire to indulge your curiosity.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   When ideas stop flowing, ask yourself:\n How can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said?  (Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced conclusions are necessary. But I like placing them after my resulting points to prompt readers into action. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\n  First, share a poignant takeaway Identify your article\u0026rsquo;s significance by re-reading it and asking, \u0026ldquo;What was this really about? What was I trying to say?\u0026rdquo;\nDistill the answer into a single, punchy sentence. Make readers think, \u0026ldquo;Ahh, yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why this article was profound.\u0026rdquo;\n  Next, provide next steps Now that your wisdom has resonated with readers, ask yourself, What about the world can my readers better appreciate now that they\u0026rsquo;ve read my article?\nShare where they can go next to continue the journey they started here.\n  For a writing guide such as this, I might conclude by sharing bloggers whose work I enjoy. Then I might urge you to reverse engineer their articles and study what makes them great. That\u0026rsquo;s how you continue your learning.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   While writing, keep these points in mind:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained by your outline. Expect to discover most of your ideas throughout the writing process. Trust that what interests you is what interests your readers. If not, target an audience more like yourself.  (Shapiro n.d.-e)\n Rewriting and Editing  Your favorite authors' first drafts are typically bad too. However, great authors have the discipline to aggressively rewrite their first drafts in pursuit of:\n Being clearly understood Persuasive reasoning Sustaining curiosity Resonance — Story, analogy, and poetry  The enemy of those objectives is being precious about what you originally said and how you originally said it.\nWhen you first write an idea down, you do so in whatever disjointed way immediately came to mind. Rewriting is the art of finding the correct puzzle pieces within that mess and putting them together in the right order.\nIn short, your first draft is to extract novel ideas out of your brain. Your second draft is to rewrite those ideas so they resonate.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Goal: Be understood  I like to write sentences that a thirteen-year-old could follow.\nIf they can understand, so can everyone else—including anyone who\u0026rsquo;s skimming.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say children should understand the details and nuances. Rather, I think children should be able to follow the logic of all your arguments.\nYou already do this intuitively. When speaking to children, you simplify:\n You use plain phrasing. You use fewer ideas per sentence.  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n This reminds me of Freddish, though it\u0026rsquo;s aimed at a much younger audience.\n   Remove abstract phrasing\n Here\u0026rsquo;s a sentence with complex phrasing:\n\u0026ldquo;The obstacle facing media organizations is charting an economically sustainable course through a landscape of commodity journalism.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that plainly:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are struggling to stay in business because anyone with a Twitter account can report the news now. The news has never been more of a commodity than it is today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how you talk to a thirteen-year-old. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how you should talk to everyone all the time.\nIn the revised example, I removed abstract words like \u0026ldquo;charted\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;landscape,\u0026rdquo; and I represented a concept with a specific example.\nBy removing this overhead, the underlying point stands out. That\u0026rsquo;s our goal.\nGrammatical simplification such as this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make your writing worse. The complexity of your writing should emerge from the strength of its ideas, not from how those ideas are worded.\nHowever, don\u0026rsquo;t drop key information when simplifying. This, for example, would be too reductive:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are not doing well today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat loses the point of why news companies are not doing well. Simplify your sentences without removing the nuances.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to over-index on the \u0026ldquo;make it concrete\u0026rdquo; aspect of this advice. I worry someone reading the second sentence may walk away with the mistaken understanding that Twitter is the sole driving force behind commodity journalism.\nSimilarly, a double-edged sword of abstract writing is that it can have multiple correct interpretations. Consider the following rewrite:\n One last example. Let\u0026rsquo;s remove abstract words and talk plainly:\nBad paragraph — \u0026ldquo;Ignorance of corporate dynamics represent a persistent source of pain for a certain type of operator. Intelligent but inexperienced. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that you avoid this pain by understanding how other people make decisions in the context that they\u0026rsquo;re incentivized to do so and by appreciating the constraints they\u0026rsquo;re operating within.\u0026rdquo;\nRewritten — \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s common to be a smart person who\u0026rsquo;s unaware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I recommend writing down the frameworks your team uses to make big decisions. Then, when a colleague proposes an idea that doesn\u0026rsquo;t intuitively make sense to you, think through their idea using their own frameworks. Work from there to build empathy and have a constructive dialogue.\u0026rdquo;\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I read the \u0026ldquo;Bad paragraph\u0026rdquo; to be discussing how inter-personal and corporate politics influence an organization. The \u0026ldquo;Intelligent but inexperienced\u0026rdquo; operator would be one who knows how to do their tasks well but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know The game. As an example: They may, without intending to, make another coworker look foolish and thereby make an enemy.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Rewritten\u0026rdquo; paragraph seems to discuss how to navigate a bureaucracy with an obscured decision-making process and advocates empathy.\nA statement made in plain language would avoid this ambiguity.\n     Use fewer ideas per sentence\nAgain, I take issue with the example presented:\n Consider this bad paragraph:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a fast growing collection of data describing the structure and functional capacity of human gut bacteria in a variety of conditions. Ongoing efforts to further characterize the multitude of functions of gut bacteria and the mechanisms underlying its interactions will provide a better understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health and disease.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that for a thirteen-year-old:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research on gut bacteria. We\u0026rsquo;re quickly learning which roles gut bacteria play and how they interact with each other. Researchers want to better understand how these bacteria can affect our overall health.\u0026rdquo;\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research\u0026rdquo; may read to some as \u0026ldquo;There is enough/sufficient research\u0026rdquo;.\n     Provide examples\n Tips for providing examples:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t just provide good examples, also provide bad examples. Before-and-after comparisons—like a good paragraph versus a bad paragraph—clarify what you mean and don\u0026rsquo;t mean. Help readers orient themselves on a spectrum of right to wrong. If you make your examples fun and topical, readers pay more attention. Examples with many moving parts should possibly be turned into diagrams.  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n   Goal: Be concise Also see:\n If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written A Shorter Letter The Shorter and Plainer the Better   Succinctness—a lack of bloat—helps readers finish your post. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from asking a lot of friends for feedback is that readers often quit not because they dislike your ideas, but because they\u0026rsquo;re bored.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn speech, when you say something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you can add sentences to further explain your point. Don\u0026rsquo;t do that in writing. If your sentence doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you go back and rewrite it.\nWriting is a process of deliberate thought curation—where each sentence can justify its inclusion in your final draft.\nWhen a deliberate writer has written something down, they then ask:\n What is the purpose of the statement I just made? What effect does it have on the reader\u0026rsquo;s mind? Is there something more useful I could have said instead?  Later, when they get stuck expanding on their ideas, they ask:\n How can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said?  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Feedback  Getting feedback is the most efficient way to improve your writing. This is not optional. Giving feedback is as important: giving it to others forces you to internalize the learnings from this handbook.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n   Ask for feedback from the audience you\u0026rsquo;re writing for. Here\u0026rsquo;s a template:\nIt would be helpful if you read my article slowly to transcribe the reactions you have while reading it. For example:\n  Tell me what to delete — When you notice your interest is fading, you can say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m drifting here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t compelling and it isn\u0026rsquo;t adding value. Get to the point quicker and hook me.\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell me what to double down on — When something excites you, you can say \u0026ldquo;Dopamine hit. Go further in this direction. I have more questions.\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell me what isn\u0026rsquo;t clear — When you\u0026rsquo;re done reading, please score this from 1-10 on how satisfying it was. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to give me a low score. By telling me this needs work, you\u0026rsquo;re sparing me from releasing bad work to the public.\n  Keep asking for feedback then rewriting until you average a score of 7.5+ across a handful of respondents. That puts you in the \u0026ldquo;this was a good read\u0026rdquo; category.\nDo not waste time striving for 9+. One reader\u0026rsquo;s 9 is not the same as another\u0026rsquo;s, so trying to satisfy everyone results in a bloated post that satisfies no one. There are many great ways to tell a story, so be happy when you\u0026rsquo;ve found one that works.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I worry that the 1-10 scale is too wide \u0026ndash; that one individual\u0026rsquo;s 7/10 isn\u0026rsquo;t meaningfully different from their 6/10. Perhaps a 1-5 scale?\n Your best source of feedback is often you with the benefit of hindsight. But you need a break to get that perspective. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a week is often enough time to sufficiently defamiliarize myself with my own writing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTake it from the world\u0026rsquo;s most successful hyper-prolific writer, Stephen King: he shoves his manuscript into a drawer for six weeks before writing his final draft. When he re-opens it, he sees its flaws with fresh eyes.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Writing Style  What gives a world-class author their \u0026ldquo;voice?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, ask your friends what it\u0026rsquo;s like to talk to you. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll mention your:\n Tone of voice Sense of humor Eccentricities Viewpoints  Convey those traits in your writing, and readers [will] recognize your voice. Meaning, I don\u0026rsquo;t think voice is your choice of words. It\u0026rsquo;s your unfiltered self reflected on paper.\nIn early drafts, I like to discard my reflex to self-censor. Talk vulnerably like you do with friends. In later drafts, you can remove sensitive details.\nUntil then, it\u0026rsquo;s a confession.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe antidote to inauthenticity is reminding yourself how you talk with friends. Record yourself talking, transcribe it, and work from that.\n(Shapiro n.d.-f)\n   The more steps you can be removed while still successfully communicating the meaning, the more \u0026ldquo;elegant\u0026rdquo; your poetry feels. The more profound your underlying point, the more \u0026ldquo;deep\u0026rdquo; your poetry feels.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s walk through an example using a framework I devised.\n  First-order description\nIn a first-order description, you directly describe how something is.\n\u0026ldquo;The day was hot.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is how we commonly talk.\n  Second-order description In a second-order description, you describe something by stating an effect it has on its environment.\n\u0026ldquo;The day melted our popsicles.\u0026rdquo;\nThe reader can determine that the day was therefore hot.\n  Third-order description In a third-order description, you describe something by stating its effect but not mentioning the cause by name.\n\u0026ldquo;Our popsicles melted.\u0026rdquo;\nAbove, there\u0026rsquo;s ambiguity as to why our popsicles melted. But with a bit of imagination and puzzle-solving, the reader pieces it together.\n  (Shapiro n.d.-f)\n Practicing Writing  To learn what a job well done looks like, dissect your favorite posts: highlight the best and worst parts of each and identify what makes them so.\nI find that writers who post frequently (say, twice weekly) are rarely worth reading consistently. I read for insights. And no writer can generate profound insights on a fixed schedule. I aggregate writers who publish sporadically. When they post, they truly have something to say.\n(Shapiro n.d.-b)\n Flashcards Julian Shapiro defines a {{novel idea}@0} as {{new to the reader, significant, and not easily intuited}@1}.    position ease box interval due     0 2.65 7 362.68 2024-06-10T07:08:36Z   1 1.45 8 58.48 2023-08-09T04:48:06Z    Source (Shapiro n.d.-d)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Shapiro, Julian. n.d.-a. “The Writing Well Handbook.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro. ———. n.d.-b. “Writing Handbook: How to Practice Writing.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/practicing. ———. n.d.-c. “Writing Handbook: How to Rewrite Your First Draft.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/rewriting. ———. n.d.-d. “Writing Handbook: How to Source Writing Ideas.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/ideas. ———. n.d.-e. “Writing Handbook: How to Write a First Draft.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/first-draft. ———. n.d.-f. “Writing Handbook: How to Write with Style.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/style.

(I Want To Become Stronger)"},{"content":"Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)\nSummary Mastering something requires mastering the literal game as well as the Metagame; in that order.\nThoughts Notes  Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called \u0026lsquo;the meta\u0026rsquo;.\n   Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.\n   What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.\n   The nature of the metagame demands that you play the base game well. It lives on top of the pattern-matching that comes with expertise.\nThis seems like an obvious thing to say. But as with most such things, the second-order implications are more interesting than the first-order ones. For instance, because expertise is necessary to play the metagame, it is often useful to search for the meta in your domain as a north star for expertise. The way I remind myself of this is to say that I should \u0026lsquo;locate the meta\u0026rsquo; whenever I\u0026rsquo;m at the bottom of a skill tree. Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t yet participate, searching for the metagame that experts play will usually give me hints as to what skills I must acquire in order to become good enough.\nAn example suffices: in marketing, I have found it very useful to seek out articles or podcasts (but especially podcasts) where practitioners talk about the ways their best practices have changed: \u0026ldquo;In the past I did X and now it seems it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well, so now we do Y, and I recommend Y.\u0026rdquo; This tells me that:\nI need to learn Y and at least have a passing familiarity with X, because X is what came before and is \u0026lsquo;covered ground\u0026rsquo;, and I need to remember the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of the shift. If one such shift happened in the past, more may happen in the future. More concretely, this is something like a podcast guest saying:\n\u0026ldquo;In the past (for content marketing) I did roundup posts, but these don\u0026rsquo;t seem to work as well anymore. So now we do longer, more comprehensive guides, and we cross-launch those to Product Hunt and Hacker News and social media. That seems to work better for us.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich in turn tells me:\nI need to look up as many examples of these \u0026lsquo;comprehensive guides\u0026rsquo; to see what the state of the art looks like. From there I can develop an understanding of how they are planned, how they are executed and what success looks like when these things are launched.

Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an \u0026ldquo;I know more than you do\u0026rdquo;- or \u0026ldquo;Just because\u0026rdquo;-type responses.\nThoughts The learning done through Socratic questioning is worth the potential friction of such a conversation. Be careful that the person is asking questions in good faith rather than attempting to Control the conversation.\nNotes  Imagine an kid in school first hearing about germ theory. The conversation might go something like this:\nTeacher: Many diseases like the common cold are spread by germs, when one infected person contacts another.\nStudent: But I got a cold a few weeks ago, and I never touch anyone except my family members. And none of them were sick.\nTeacher: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to actually touch someone. Sometimes it can spread through mucus droplets in the air.\nStudent: And one time I was camping in the woods for a month, and then I got a cold, even though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been around anybody.\nTeacher: If it was spring, you might have gotten allergies. Allergies can feel a lot like a cold, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t spread by germs.\nStudent: It was fall.\nTeacher: Then maybe it was an unusual allergy, or some other condition.\nStudent: Hey, wait. If germs are spread from person to person on touch, why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the government just mandate one week when nobody is allowed to touch anyone else? Then all the germs will die and we\u0026rsquo;ll never have to worry about germs again.\nTeacher: That\u0026rsquo;s a good question. A lot of germs have what\u0026rsquo;s called reservoirs in the environment, where they live when they\u0026rsquo;re not infecting humans. Even if the government tried your plan, probably most sicknesses would come back from their reservoirs.\nStudent: I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a germ reservoir. Where are they?\nTeacher: They\u0026rsquo;re not literal reservoirs like a water reservoir, that\u0026rsquo;s just what we call it when germs live in bats or raccoons or something.\nNotice a few things about this conversation.\nFirst, it\u0026rsquo;s really good that it happened. The student was clearly confused at many points. First, he had direct evidence that seemed to contradict the teacher\u0026rsquo;s claims that germs only spread by touch. Second, he had a sort of efficient-market-style confusion: germ theory seems to imply an easy way to eliminate all sicknesses forever, so why hasn\u0026rsquo;t someone picked this low-hanging fruit? Third, he was confused by an awkward term – he thought germ reservoirs were lakes full of germs in the hills somewhere.\nAll of these confusions are totally understandable. In fact, they\u0026rsquo;re a really good sign he\u0026rsquo;s paying attention – that he\u0026rsquo;s trying to figure out what germ theory really means and how it interacts with the rest of his worldview. They\u0026rsquo;re the direct opposite of guessing the teacher\u0026rsquo;s password. One day this kid is going to be an amazing scientist.\nSecond, to a hostile observer, it would sound like the student was challenging the teacher. Every time the teacher tried to explain germ theory, the student \u0026ldquo;pounced\u0026rdquo; on a supposed inconsistency. When the teacher tried to explain the inconsistency, the student challenged her explanations. At times he almost seems to be mocking the teacher. Without contextual clues – and without an appreciation for how confused young kids can be sometimes – it could sound like this kid is an arrogant know-it-all who thinks he\u0026rsquo;s checkmated biologists and proven that germ theory can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be true. Or that he thinks that he, a mere schoolchild, can come up with a novel way to end all sickness forever that nobody else ever thought of.\nAnd the thesis of this post is that you must never, ever say that. Saying that is so bad. Smack down that student once, say \u0026ldquo;I think I know more about germ theory than you do\u0026rdquo;, make him feel like he challenged your authority and that\u0026rsquo;s bad – and the best case scenario is he will never ask questions to resolve his confusion again. The worst case scenario is that he stops feeling the confusion entirely, or stops thinking of forcing things to fit together and make sense as a desirable goal to have.\nOne of the most important rationalist skills is \u0026ldquo;noticing your confusion\u0026rdquo;. But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought. And interpreting an attempt to explore dissonance as a status grab that needs to be knocked down is absolutely fatal for that skill. Instead, you need to think of it as Socratic grilling – like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly.\nTolerating this is harder than it sounds. Most people can stay helpful for one or two iterations. But most people are bad at explaining things, so one or two iterations isn\u0026rsquo;t always enough I\u0026rsquo;ve had times when I need five or ten question-answer rounds with a teacher in order to understand what they\u0026rsquo;re telling me. The process sounds a lot like \u0026ldquo;The thing you just said is obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that explanation you gave doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, you\u0026rsquo;re still obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;you keep saying the same thing over and over again, and it keeps being obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s irrelevant to the point that\u0026rsquo;s bothering me\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s also irrelevant, you keep saying an obviously wrong thing\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;Oh! That word means something totally different from what I thought it meant, now your statement makes total sense.\u0026rdquo;\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s harder even than that. Sometimes there is a vast inferential distance (a) between you and the place where your teacher\u0026rsquo;s model makes sense, and you need to go through a process as laborious as converting a religious person to a materialist worldview (or vice versa) before the gap gets closed. The process of learning to really appreciate communism, or libertarianism, or whatever, coming from a diametrically opposed philosophy, looks a lot like dozens of questions about \u0026ldquo;but isn\u0026rsquo;t that an atrocity?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wouldn\u0026rsquo;t this inevitably lead to dystopia?\u0026rdquo; and hearing what your interlocutor has to answer. It\u0026rsquo;s so, so tempting to round this off to them trying to gotcha you (as indeed sometimes it will be) and assume they\u0026rsquo;re not really committed to trying to understand.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2020. “Socratic Grilling.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/06/socratic-grilling/.

The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat. The course is delivered in small groups facilitated by a trained instructor. Participants receive reading materials on Dr. John Sarno\u0026rsquo;s and Dr. Howard Schubiner\u0026rsquo;s work to study during the intervention period. The educational sessions are focused on the relationship between psychological stress and pain and are divided in four components according to their content:\n Component 1: Psycophysiologic Pain Education  The mainstay of this component is for the participants to recognize their symptoms as a part of a psychophysiologic mind-body syndrome, as opposed to an exclusively physical etiology. This recognition is accomplished by exploring the history of their pain, identifying \u0026ldquo;inconsistencies\u0026rdquo; in the physical components of their pain (discrepancies in symptom localization and/or temporal occurrence), and acquiring information on the nature of nonspecific chronic back pain itself. Great focus is placed on the role of the relationship of underlying psychological stressors to physical pain. As participants are encouraged to examine the origin of the pain, they notice patterns in the experience of their pain that reflect the contribution of psychological and stress-related factors (e.g. experiencing severe back pain when driving but only when in heavy traffic, pain that occurs with sitting but not when sitting on a chairlift during recreational skiing, pain that is worse while walking into the workplace but fine when walking upon exiting). Hereby, participants gain awareness of the connection between pain and psychological processes and a better understanding of the variety of potentially modifiable factors that contribute to chronic back pain.\nExamples:\nIn the above example of an inconsistency, a participant complaining about back pain when driving, was able to identify that he was experiencing pain only while driving on busy roads and not on less busy roads. As a next step, the participant was able to recognize both the role of stress and the underlying emotion of anger that occurred when driving on a busy road. As the participant became able to recognize the feeling of anger in this situation, his pain during driving dissipated. This, in turn, provided insight into his pain in other circumstances and his overall pain resolved over time in conjunction with the other components of this program.\nAnother participant experienced pain while sitting, yet upon reflection, she recognized there were times when sitting did not cause pain such as when she was knitting (an activity she loved to do and which she found relaxing). During the course of this program, she was able to recognize this \u0026ldquo;inconsistency\u0026rdquo; as well as others and worked on desensitization (see component II). Additionally, she was able to realize that she put tremendous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother and wife. As she learned to be more accepting of herself, her unrealistic expectations of herself were reduced as was her pain experience.\n Component 2: Desensitization and Returning to Physical Activity  One of the main contributors hypothesized to contribute to chronic pain derived from psychophysiologic causes is that pain becomes a conditioned response to a physical trigger. According to the classical conditioning model, previously neutral stimuli can become linked to the pain experience. Thus, without the need for a current nociceptive input, this association can be coupled with physical reactions ultimately leading to pain. For example, formerly elicited pain-induced muscle tensions can become associated with other stimuli like sitting or walking and lead to fear and avoidance of these positions/movements. This association can result in fear of recreating pain and thus avoidance of these movements Therefore, one of the key components of our therapy program is to \u0026ldquo;desensitize\u0026rdquo; the participants and break the cycle of pain. In order to achieve this goal, multiple desensitization techniques are utilized in this phase.\nVisual motor imagery (mental simulation of a painful situation) is a desensitization technique during which the participant is asked to first visualize a movement where pain typically occurs. Often (though not universally) the visualization will bring on pain. When this occurs, this serves to help the participant recognize that the pain can be elicited simply in his or her mind without any physical movement. This concept helps support the fact that the pain is psychophysiologic in nature. Next, the person is encouraged to repeatedly visualize the movement which caused pain while they are repeating self-soothing statements. With these repeated visualizations (without physical movement), the pain can ultimately wane and cannot be reproduced using visualization alone. When this process is complete (and pain can no longer be elicited), the patient can then proceed with slowly undertaking the actual movements/positions (see example below).\nAdditionally, identifying conditioned responses in daily life is a crucial part of this phase. For example, if sitting were a trigger, one would sit with the knowledge that the pain associated with sitting is a conditioned response and not actually related to some physical injury or component of sitting. Over time, the pain will dissipate, and the conditioning will be effectively reversed, allowing the participant to return to full physical activity. By returning to previous physical activity, patients also reinforce the \u0026ldquo;knowledge therapy\u0026rdquo; component as they begin to recognize that pain is not actually related to physical triggers per se, but rather psychological triggers. The safety of participants during this process is ensured through the gradual increase of activity under the supervision of a physician (see examples below).\nExample:\nA participant reported having pain with prolonged standing and notably when standing at a bus stop waiting for work. She attributed the pain to the physical activity of prolonged standing. Occasionally, she would return home and miss work because of the severity of the pain. During our program, she first visualized standing at the bus stop, and this reproduced her pain and discomfort. The ability for her to bring on severe pain simply through visualization allowed her to recognize the psychological component of her pain. She then reflected further on the situation from a different perspective and recognized that she was under a great degree of psychological stress while at the bus stop anticipating her day at work. With all this in mind, she first performed visual motor imagery repeatedly over a few days using self-soothing techniques until she reached the point that she could no longer reproduce the pain during visualization. Then, she stood at the bus stop reminding herself that the origin of the pain was not the physical act of standing. Over time, she stood for longer periods of time and the pain decreased despite the overall increase in physical activity. Ultimately, the pain resolved to the point where prolonged standing was no longer a trigger for her pain.\n Component 3: Emotional Expression - Psycology of the Syndrome  Reports on \u0026ldquo;functional\u0026rdquo; back pain conditions date back from as early as 1946 (1). The notion that chronic pain may persist as a manifestation of unexpressed negative affective states (e.g. hostility or aggressive impulses that the individual is unwilling or unable to acknowledge) was formulated in 1959 (2). Taking into consideration that some of the contributors to persistent pain include underlying stressful conflicts and aversive affective states, strategies encouraging emotional expression are essential in the treatment of mind-body syndrome. Emotional expression is accomplished through a series of writing exercises and journaling (free writing, cluster writing, letters of forgiveness, gratitude lists), self-reflection, as well as through small group discussion. A recent treatment developed by Drs. Schubiner and Lumley, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), includes similar techniques (3).\nAs an example, a participant realized during the above-mentioned exercises that he was being negatively impacted by the emotional pain caused by the imminent ending of his marriage. As he began to express his emotions, he noticed a significant reduction in his physical pain. Another example noted earlier was a patient who developed severe pain when driving on crowded streets but not on roads without traffic. He ultimately recognized that he was experiencing anger and frustration in a number of specific situations such as being stuck in traffic. This awareness of anger-related contributions to his pain (rather than an exclusively physical explanation that sitting for long periods results in mechanically induced increases in pain) and subsequent expression of those negative emotions helped the patient to improve his pain.\n Component 4: Stress reduction - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  As stress is an underlying component of MBS, the final arm of the program is to engage in stress-reduction techniques. By starting this program with the PSRT portion, participants are often already seeing improvements before embarking on this last portion of the program. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for the prevention and treatment of stress related disorders (4). MBSR has been linked to significant improvements in overall health and well-being, leading to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain (5, 6, 7). MBSR is an 8-week educational program which includes weekly sessions and mindful practice. Students are encouraged to perform daily home practice, which is explored throughout the program. Our MBSR classes adhered to the original protocol of the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. Our mindfulness sessions entail a series of strategies for cultivating present moment awareness - the ability to experience what is arising in the present moment. This allows for the observation of thoughts (past or future), the disengagement from emotional reactivity and the ability to stay with the sensate experience in the body - the outcome of which is a deeper sense of ease, emotional balance and general well-being.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Donnino, Michael W., Garrett S.

This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times. I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does. And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not.\n Discipline is more effective than motivation\n Don\u0026rsquo;t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that\u0026rsquo;s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you\u0026rsquo;ll be less happy).

Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There\u0026rsquo;s a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio, for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing (read: felt compelled to play) so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I thought about my factory and future factories throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It\u0026rsquo;s not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but rather: I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I\u0026rsquo;d realigned my goals around the game; those goals won\u0026rsquo;t take me where I want to go.\nRelated: Be conscious of your defaults\nFlashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 2.80 7 300.74 2024-04-07T11:13:44Z   back 2.50 7 268.98 2024-02-15T13:20:58Z    Notice the taste of lotus\nBack  Be aware of the things which seek to grab your attention away from you Be conscious of your defaults Be aware of your sources of Akrasia  References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Valentine. 2018. “Noticing the Taste of Lotus.” Less Wrong. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwdcMts8P8hacqwrX/noticing-the-taste-of-lotus.

But ask yourself a question: will you run a gitcommit search if you have an encoding error in your project when executing scripts? No. Most will answer that they will open google , or immediately [Stack Overflow] and there they will look for a solution to the problem.

Although I have no doubt that the author of the commit is a smart guy, and gathered the right information to find the problem with encodings.\n   How could you have done\nTest\nThe very first thing that came to my mind was a test. Write a test that will check for new such errors in the project (Den should have written a bash test that would check the encoding in the project files before running all the tests). When configured, CI is a powerful tool for future project participants. If someone in the future wrote one / several (yes, even the entire file) in a different encoding, then he would be stopped by a test that would kindly report the accepted encoding in the project - checkmate.\nDocumentation\nThe accepted encoding is a disciplinary rule in the project. Since the project has readme, it was possible to add a paragraph there about the accepted encoding and possible problems if you deviate from this encoding. After all, new people enter the project just through reading readme(usually it says how to run, which versions to use, possible errors, even the changelog of versions can be seen there). Then, faced with a similar error, the project participant would definitely remember the accepted encoding and fix the problem. Leaving documentation of the project discipline rules in commit messages would not have the same effect.\n   A commit message to change a single character is hard-to-find information. The project once paid for this information, but now it\u0026rsquo;s worthless, floundering uselessly in a sea of ​​27,000 commits. And the project will have to pay more if a similar problem shoots in the future.\nLong commit messages degrade maintainability\nIf you are tempted to write a whole story in a commit message, you should think about how you can provide this story in another way - tests or documentation are much better.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.  One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.   The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.  There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; study method, though some are better than others. The study method which will be most effective will depend on the situation in which you will need to recall the information.    Terms  Testing effect Item-specific processing Relational processing Permastore  Thoughts Spaced repetition, which incorporates the Testing effect, seems like a great fit. However, I think it would be easy to create flashcards which aid in memorizing a fact but not in understanding or application. For instance: I could imagine a card which asks you to recall the abstract steps required to multiply a IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix. I think this card, on its own, would not be sufficient to maintain understanding or the ability to perform matrix multiplication. Perhaps you could supplement the card with others which ask:\n What conditions are necessary to multiply two matrices (AxB and CxD)? A card, or several, which provide specific examples using numbers rather than generalizations? Perhaps there is a script or addon which allows for this sort of thing.  I worry that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough to maintain understanding and the ability to apply this knowledge even with these, and more, cards. It would certainly reduce the barrier to re-entry. I used to understand much more calculus than I could prove to you now after letting it fall out of my mind since college. Keeping up with calculus topics, example problems, definitions, etc, through it would at least make it easier for me to jump back in should the need arise. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be as \u0026ldquo;on the ball\u0026rdquo; as I would if I were actively using and practicing calculus regularly, but I would be at a better place than I am now.\nMemory in Educational Settings Guiding Theoretical Principles Introducing \u0026ldquo;Desirable Difficulties\u0026rdquo; During Learning  Performance during learning is a poor predictor of future performance because it reflects the momentary accessibility of knowledge (i.e., retrieval strength) rather than how well it has been stored in memory (i.e., storage strength)\n   Storage strength increases when a memory is retrieved or the event is reexperienced.\n   [I]f knowledge is to be retained over long periods of time, then the goal of learning must be to increase storage strength, not momentary accessibility.\n   Based on the distinction between retrieval strength and storage strength, R. A. Bjork and colleagues developed the concept of \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulties\u0026rdquo; in learning (Bjork, 1994a, 1994b; Christina \u0026amp; Bjork, 1991; Schmidt \u0026amp; Bjork, 1992). The main idea is that introducing difficulties during learning will result in superior long-term retention because the greatest gains in storage strength occur when retrieval strength is low. For example, consider the practice of using flash cards to study vocabulary words. If you study a word and then try to remember it immediately, then the gain in storage strength will be relatively low because it is so easy to retrieve the word right away (retrieval strength is high). However, if you wait 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the word (when retrieval strength will be lower), then the gain in storage strength will be larger. The implication for educational practice is that instead of arranging the conditions of learning to be easier and faster for the learner, educators should introduce difficulties into the learning process in order to promote long-term retention of knowledge.\n Processing Information to Extract Meaning  Critically, directing attention at a lower or \u0026ldquo;shallow\u0026rdquo; level of processing (e.g., focusing on the orthography of words while reading) disrupts higher or \u0026ldquo;deeper\u0026rdquo; levels of processing (e.g., determining what those words mean). As a result, the type of processing in which one consciously engages determines what information will be encoded into memory and retained. The type of processing is more important than the intent to learn (e.g., Craik \u0026amp; Tulving, 1975); the implication is that a student who deliberately prepares for a test but who does not engage in deep processing will not do as well as the student who processes the material deeply, even if the latter student is not deliberately trying to learn the material.\n   One helpful distinction involves item- specific processing versus relational processing (Hunt \u0026amp; Einstein, 1981). Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.\nIn contrast, relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other. In short, both item-specific and relational processing can involve meaning extraction, but they direct the learner to different aspects of the to-be- remembered events.\n Importance of Match Between Processing at Encoding and Retrieval  Rather, memory performance is the joint product of the way in which the memory was encoded (i.e., the memory trace that is stored) and the way in which it is retrieved (i.e., the cues provided) (e.g., Tulving \u0026amp; Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving \u0026amp; Osler, 1968). This idea is codified in the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, which states that memory performance will be enhanced to the extent that the processes engaged during initial learning match the processes required for the criterial task\n   In short, there is not always a single right answer about which study strategy will be best. Rather, as reflected in ideas about transfer-appropriate processing, the ideal study strategy depends upon what the student will need to do later.\n Summary  We have presented three general cognitive principles that are critical for determining memory performance in educational settings:\n introducing desirable difficulties during learning engaging in processes that emphasize meaning extraction and matching learning processes to the processes needed to excel on the final criterial task (i.e., transfer-appropriate processing).   Learning Strategies for Studying Material Receiving Advance Organizers Highlighting and Underlining Note Taking  Although note taking yields memorial benefits, the type of notes naturally taken may not be the most powerful Mnemonic possible. One issue involves how much note taking involves going beyond the to-be-remembered information (versus simply copying; see Marsh \u0026amp; Sink, 2010), including paraphrasing the to-be-remembered information and connecting it to stored knowledge. Returning to the levels of processing framework, the key issue is the depth of processing note taking naturally affords. We have just reviewed evidence that note taking encourages relational processing that affords transfer. Nevertheless, additional benefit may come from techniques that encourage the reader or listener to process the material even more deeply. For example, King (1992) trained students to summarize material, specifically how to identify and encapsulate the main idea. This group of students was compared to another group who took notes naturally, and who later had a chance to review those notes. Students who summarized the lecture performed better on both immediate and delayed comprehension tests than students who took notes (see Bretzing \u0026amp; Kulhavy, 1979, for similar results). Similarly, the note-taking group did not do as well as a group of students trained to ask themselves (and answer) questions about the material. Students might benefit from incorporating some of these deep processing techniques into their notes; in other words, training might help students to take notes that include more of the generative processing thought to be key for transfer (e.g., Peper \u0026amp; Mayer, 1978).\n Learning Strategies for Poststudy Retrieval Practice  \u0026hellip; memory research has shown that retrieving information from memory actually changes memory (e.g., Bjork, 1975), improving long-term retention of the material\n   The finding that retrieval practice produces superior long-term retention has been termed the Testing effect\n   When testing is used as a learning tool in educational settings, there are several ways in which its efficacy can be enhanced.\n Tests that require students to produce a response, such as short-answer and essay tests, generally lead to better retention than tests that simply require the selection of the correct response, such as multiple-choice tests and true/false tests. Taking multiple tests results in better retention than taking a single test, so it is beneficial to repeat questions on quizzes and give cumulative exams. Successful retrieval is the key to learning from tests, so providing feedback after the test is essential, especially if test-takers do not retrieve many correct responses  (paraphrased)\n Processing Feedback to Correct Errors  The most consistent result is that providing learners with the correct answer in the feedback message produces better subsequent performance than simply indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect (e.g., Pashler et al., 2005; for a meta-analysis, see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, \u0026amp; Morgan, 1991). This finding makes sense because informing the learner that a given response is incorrect will not help the learner to correct the error if the learner does not have any recourse to learn the correct answer.\n Spacing Out Practice Over Time  \u0026hellip; [I]t seems that the optimal interval depends on how long the knowledge needs to be retained after the last practice (i.e., the retention interval). Cepeda and colleagues (2006; see also Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, \u0026amp; Pashler, 2008) performed a meta-analysis that included 317 experiments from 184 articles on the Spacing effect. They found that the optimal spacing interval is approximately 10%–20% of the retention interval. Thus, if the goal is to retain the material for 5 days, then practice should be spaced over intervals between 12 and 24 hours\n Combining Techniques Applying the Guiding Principles and Learning Strategies in Educational Settings Long-Term Learning Learning Beyond Facts  \u0026hellip; [I]n the classroom, educators have many different goals for their students, and these goals vary as a function of the level of education, the type of course, and the time frame given for learning, among many other factors. One way of categorizing these goals is through Bloom\u0026rsquo;s Taxonomy (1956) of educational objectives, which conceptualizes learning as a hierarchy in which the various levels must be mastered in sequential order. The cognitive domain is comprised of six levels (from lowest to highest):\n knowledge (e.g., learning facts, concepts, etc.) comprehension (e.g., understanding the relationship between ideas) application (e.g., using knowledge to solve new problems) analysis (e.g., finding evidence to support a hypothesis) synthesis (e.g., combining different accounts of an event to understand what occurred) evaluation (e.g., assessing the validity of an idea according to certain criteria)   Permastore\nThe Relativity of Memory Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Marsh, Elizabeth J., and Andrew C.

Not only they have weak coding skills but there are also a few other things that give Junior developers away:\n Their main mantra is \u0026ldquo;making it work\u0026rdquo; without giving much attention to how the solution is achieved. To them, a working software and good software are equivalent. They usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something. They suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members. Most of the Junior developers just try to live up to the role and, when stuck, they might leave work for a senior developer instead of at least trying to take a stab at something. They don\u0026rsquo;t know about the business side of the company and don\u0026rsquo;t realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and they don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain. Over-engineering is a major problem, often leading to fragility and bugs. When given a problem, they often try to fix just the current problem a.k.a. fixing the symptoms instead of fixing the root problem. You might notice the \u0026ldquo;Somebody Else\u0026rsquo;s Problem\u0026rdquo; behavior from them. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what or how much they don\u0026rsquo;t know, thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect. They don\u0026rsquo;t take initiatives and they might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase. They don\u0026rsquo;t participate in team discussions.   Mid Level Developers  The next level after the Junior developers is Mid Level developers. They are technically stronger than the Junior developers and can work with minimal supervision. They still have some issues to address in order to jump to Senior level.\n   Mid-level developers are quite common. Most of the organizations wrongly label them as \u0026ldquo;Senior Developers\u0026rdquo;. However, they need further mentoring in order to become Senior Developers.\n Senior Developers  Senior developers are the next level after the Mid-level developers. They are the people who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road. They are more mature, have gained experience by delivering both good and bad software in the past and have learned from it — they know how to be pragmatic. Here is the list of things that are normally expected of a Senior Developer:\n With their past experiences, mistakes made, issues faced by over-designed or under-designed software, they can foresee the problems and persuade the direction of the codebase or the architecture. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;Shiny-Toy\u0026rdquo; syndrome. They are pragmatic in the execution. They can make the tradeoffs when required, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic. They have a good picture of the field, know what the best tool for the job is in most cases (even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the tool). They have the innate ability to pick up a new tool/language/paradigm/etc in order to solve a problem that requires it. They are aware they\u0026rsquo;re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs to taking un-glorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done. They have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development. They don\u0026rsquo;t make empty complaints, they make judgments based on the empirical evidence and they have suggestions for solutions. They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code. They have the ability to take on large ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract, and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them. They have respect for the code that was written before them. They are generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. They approach inheriting legacy code with an \u0026ldquo;opportunity mindset\u0026rdquo; rather than a complaining one. They know how to give feedback without hurting anyone.

We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal. We do any number of things. But we do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions that would effectively optimize for our claimed goals, or for any other goals.\n Thoughts We don\u0026rsquo;t automatically seek out a Theory of change. Instead, we see the greatest improvements through increased pattern matching such that our default habits and instincts are better aligned with the optimal strategy.\nNotes  Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a \u0026ldquo;fear of success\u0026rdquo;; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)\nWhy do most of us, most of the time, choose to \u0026ldquo;pursue our goals\u0026rdquo; through routes that are far less effective than the routes we could find if we tried? My guess is that here, as with the calculus test, the main problem is that most courses of action are extremely ineffective, and that there has been no strong evolutionary or cultural force sufficient to focus us on the very narrow behavior patterns that would actually be effective.\nTo be more specific: there are clearly at least some limited senses in which we have goals. We: (1) tell ourselves and others stories of how we\u0026rsquo;re aiming for various \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;; (2) search out modes of activity that are consistent with the role, and goal-seeking, that we see ourselves as doing (\u0026ldquo;learning math\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;becoming a comedian\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;being a good parent\u0026rdquo;); and sometimes even (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do/don\u0026rsquo;t achieve our \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;.\nBut there are clearly also heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement (or that would be part of what it means to \u0026ldquo;have goals\u0026rdquo; at all) that we do not automatically carry out. We do not automatically:\n (a) Ask ourselves what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (\u0026ldquo;what does it look like to be a good comedian?\u0026quot;) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven\u0026rsquo;t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren\u0026rsquo;t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don\u0026rsquo;t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that isn\u0026rsquo;t going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our \u0026ldquo;goal\u0026rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won\u0026rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting;  \u0026hellip;. or carry out any number of other useful techniques.

[\u0026hellip;] useful.\n   Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn\u0026rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\n   In effect the [novelty, correctness, importance, and strength] are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.\n   [\u0026hellip;] if you write a bad sentence, you don\u0026rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s a trick for getting importance too. It\u0026rsquo;s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they\u0026rsquo;ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\n   The way to get novelty is to write about topics you\u0026rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who\u0026rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n   [\u0026hellip;] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. [\u0026hellip;] As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you\u0026rsquo;re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm\u0026rsquo;s length with perhapses.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It\u0026rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it\u0026rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader\u0026rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that\u0026rsquo;s too long.\n   Sometimes the reason people don\u0026rsquo;t know something is because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to know it.\n Flashcards Paul Graham considers a useful essay as one which is {{novel, correct, important, and strong}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.30 6 12.42 2023-08-05T14:09:25Z    Source (Graham n.d.)\nPaul Graham considers a strong essay to be one which {{can afford to omit qualification (e.g. \u0026ldquo;perhaps\u0026rdquo;)}@0}    position ease box interval due     0 1.60 9 97.40 2023-09-07T11:08:33Z    Source (Graham n.d.)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Graham, Paul. n.d. “How to Write Usefully.” Accessed February 7, 2022. http://paulgraham.com/useful.html.

[\u0026hellip;] I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to fully understand these people and I apologize for any misrepresentations I might be making. But the short version is: they all agree that everything went wrong when we switched from saturated to unsaturated fat.\n It stands out because Scott specifically mentions the edge of his research and yet published the piece anyway. There is a loud voice in the back of my head whenever I\u0026rsquo;m writing anything \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; which drives me to go deeper and that stones left unturned will mar my writing. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend anyone to actually listen to this voice but it\u0026rsquo;s damn loud and I\u0026rsquo;m glad to see a concrete example of someone ignoring it.\n\u0026ldquo;Processed\u0026rdquo; Food  What food counts as \u0026ldquo;processed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not processed\u0026rdquo;?\n I found myself nodding along to this paragraph as I read. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the same thought with the same (inferred) sense of exasperation.\nNotes  In the 1800s, the average US man weighed about (a) 155 lbs. Today, he weighs about 195. The change is even starker at the extremes. Someone at the 90th percentile of weight back then weighed about 185 lbs; today, he would weigh 320 lbs. Back then, about 1% (a) of men were obese. Today, about 25% are.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe answer to all these questions seems to be something like \u0026ldquo;the body is pretty good at regulating its own weight under any diet except modern American processed food.\u0026rdquo; But what aspect of processed food makes it bad?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe only common villain everyone agrees on in the obesity story is \u0026ldquo;processed food\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve previously found this frustrating – it reeks of a sort of unreflective technophobia. What part of processing makes food bad? How does mere contact with a machine turn food from healthy to unhealthy? What food counts as \u0026ldquo;processed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not processed\u0026rdquo;? Is ground beef processed, since you grind it? Are scrambled eggs processed, since you scramble them? Is bread processed, since wheat doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow in loaves? Is water processed, since it goes through water processing facilities? Is the Eucharist processed, even though the processing only changes its metaphysical essence and not its physical properties? Everybody I ask acts like the answers to these questions are obvious, but everyone has different answers, and nobody can tell me their decision procedure.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut how could that be? If people used to be thin and healthy, we should just be able to do what they were doing! And then that would be the diet that can consistently lose weight and keep it off!\nI can only see three ways out of this paradox.\nFirst, conventional wisdom is right about everything. People are fatter today than in the 1800s because they eat too much and exercise too little. They eat too much because they are rich, food is cheap, and food tastes really good. They exercise too little because they\u0026rsquo;re office workers now instead of farmers. In this model, the reason the efficient market hasn\u0026rsquo;t found the secret to weight loss is because there\u0026rsquo;s no secret and weight loss is really hard. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard for your great-grandfather because he had fewer options and so he didn\u0026rsquo;t need to exercise willpower to avoid the bad ones. The most sophisticated version of this model, so sophisticated that maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it this model at all, is the food reward theory ably defended by Stephan Guyenet (a).\nThis has a lot going for it, but can\u0026rsquo;t be quite right. Exercise seems like a red herring; studies of how much people eat, exercise, and gain weight have shown (a) that dietary changes explain more than 100% of weight gain over the past 30-40 years \u0026ndash; probably we are exercising a little more. And there was really tasty food in 1800s America and 1970s France, so how come people didn\u0026rsquo;t overindulge in that? How does it explain all the weird results like lab animals, pets, and feral rats gaining weight (a)? This probably part of it, but it still feels like something\u0026rsquo;s missing.\nSecond, diet is barely related to the obesity epidemic, and it\u0026rsquo;s being caused by plastics or antibiotics affecting the microbiome or something like that. This is another thing where I would have expected people to notice, but I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want to dismiss it prematurely.\nThird, it\u0026rsquo;s a ratchet. Departing from the ways of our ancestors (or great-grandparents) can make you obese, but returning to their ways cannot make you thin again. A bad diet (whatever that is) shifts your weight set point up, but a good diet does not shift it back down, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. It just prevents further damage.\nThis contradicts the evidence from some people who do manage to lose weight, including some people who manage to lose a lot of weight and keep it off. I think the theory would have to be that different people\u0026rsquo;s set points are differently malleable, and that some people are obese because their set point is set to obese, and other people barely have a set point and are mostly operating on calories-in-calories-out. If this seems a little too convenient an assumption, keep in mind this is how lots of other set points work – some people will gain tolerance to certain drugs almost instantly, and other people will never get it at all.\nOverall I am ending this research more confused than when I started it. I think the most likely dietary change I make is to try to avoid foods with soybean, corn, or safflower oil, since this is probably a good stand-in for \u0026ldquo;foods processed enough that they count as processed foods and you should avoid them\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the evidence is good for avoiding fish oil and olive oil, and there\u0026rsquo;s enough evidence from elsewhere that these foods are healthy that I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep trying to eat them. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the evidence is good for saturated fats being especially good, and there seems to be at least equally strong evidence that they\u0026rsquo;re bad, so although I\u0026rsquo;m not going to work too hard to avoid them I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not going to optimize my diet for getting as many of them as possible.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2020. “For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/10/for-then-against-high-saturated-fat-diets/.

I recall them mentioning pattern matching explicitly; though I\u0026rsquo;ve since lost the reference.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] the notion that \u0026lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching\u0026rsquo; [\u0026hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I\u0026rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.\nThe first idea is the \u0026lsquo;recognition-primed decision making\u0026rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses. I\u0026rsquo;ve written extensively about the model on this blog, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to repeat myself (read this instead (a)) but the core of it is simply that expertise is an implicit memory operation (a): you recognise a situation in a developing environment and then unspool that recognition into a set of cues, a list of plausible goals, and handful of expectancies, and a series of trained actions. If the situation is novel, you construct variants of intended actions on the fly and simulate these scenarios in a loop, picking the first workable solution in your mind.\nThis model of expert decision-making is useful because it gives us a usable model of expertise — far better than the ones found in the deliberate practice literature. For example, one conclusion from this model is that if you want to become better at something, you should look for ways to expand the set of recognisable prototypes in your head.\nThe second idea is simply that expertise rests on technê, or Tacit knowledge \u0026mdash; the sort of knowledge that is impossible to communicate, that must be constructed from practice. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this idea numerous times over the past two years: first in my original criticism (a) of mental model writing, then in my reflection on Seymour Papert\u0026rsquo;s life\u0026rsquo;s work (a). I covered it again in The Mental Model FAQ (a) and The Dangers of Treating Ideas from Finance as Generalised Self Help (a). I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it here and there throughout Commonplace\u0026rsquo;s history; indeed, my reliance on technê is one of the big pieces of idea scaffolding for this blog.\n[emphasis mine]\n   [\u0026hellip;] perhaps the art of practice is simply whatever is the most effective method of expanding one\u0026rsquo;s collection of recognisable prototypes (and of course: the actions to take in response to those recognisable prototypes).\n   What about creativity, for instance? Klein covers this in his research; in Sources of Power he discusses how expert minds use pattern-recognition to identify \u0026lsquo;leverage points\u0026rsquo; — points in which one could do something radically different — in order to come up with creative solutions within the constraints of some domain. I\u0026rsquo;ve dug a little into the research and I think the take is plausible, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely convinced. Surely the mechanism of creativity is different from the prototype-based recognition that drives most of expertise? The short answer to that seems to be \u0026lsquo;yes, creativity relies on connections between different ideas and this is independent of expertise\u0026rsquo; but also \u0026lsquo;identifying the right leverage points is still a recognition/expertise thing\u0026rsquo;. The two seem highly intertwined in the sorts of fields that Klein studies; my remaining scepticism is that I do not know if this is true in \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; creative domains like art and design and fiction writing.\n Flashcards Summarize    position ease box interval due     front 2.05 8 194.45 2024-01-10T03:37:07Z   back 2.65 7 242.23 2024-02-15T19:51:20Z    Cedric Chin | Expertise Is \u0026lsquo;Just\u0026rsquo; Pattern Matching\nBack Being an expert at something is a function of:\n recognizing situations knowing how to respond to those situations  Source (Chin 2020)\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2020. “Expertise Is ’Just’ Pattern Matching.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/expertise-is-just-pattern-matching/.

A more direct essay could have started out by stating the problems with Gottman\u0026rsquo;s research. You could argue this essay buried the lede. That said, I enjoyed reading the piece. I find it more enjoyable to read a story than a data sheet.\nNotes  The secret to a happy marriage is that you should like your spouse.\n   Don\u0026rsquo;t have a fight when you\u0026rsquo;re physiologically aroused. Don\u0026rsquo;t have a fight when you\u0026rsquo;re physiologically aroused. Monitor your physiological arousal, and if you start to notice the signs – fast heartbeat, tense muscles, shallow breathing – call a time-out, go somewhere else, and use meditation or deep breathing or whatever to calm down.\n   Gottman divides conflicts into two types: solvable and unsolvable. Solvable conflicts are simple, specific, and about the thing they seem to be about – for example, the husband is supposed to take the trash out after work, but work has gotten really stressful lately and he keeps forgetting, and now the trash is overflowing and the wife is annoyed. The solution here is to use normal problem-solving techniques. Put a sign in the bedroom saying \u0026ldquo;DID YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT?\u0026rdquo; or something. Whatever.\nUnsolvable conflicts are temporary manifestations of deep psychological issues. The particular thing that sparked the fight this time is irrelevant, but both spouses will fight to the death because it represents something important. For example, the husband is late to dinner one night because he went out to the bar. The wife yells at him and says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about her. He yells back that she\u0026rsquo;s a control freak. Here the problem will not be solved by coming up with a compromise where he can go to the bar half of nights. The problem is that she secretly worries his drinking buddies have a closer connection to him than she ever will, that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t love her anymore, that he goes to the bar to escape her. He worries that he\u0026rsquo;s lost his freedom, that he\u0026rsquo;s become emasculated, that he\u0026rsquo;s become some boring old person who is never allowed to have fun. If the bar burnt down tomorrow, they would find some other excuse to fight over this dynamic.\n   Desperation breeds gullibility. Patients with terminal diseases, however smart they used to be, turn to homeopaths and charlatans rather than face the dismal truth.\n   [\u0026hellip;] whenever I hear people talk about relationships, I hear weird echoes of political problems. People who hate their spouse have an outgroup of one. A unified polity has devolved into partisanship. Social trust has been broken; a defect-defect equilibrium is in place. Gottman thinks of couples as a two-person culture, and some of those cultures are decadent and fractious.\n   In marriage, as in other forms of politics, sometimes exit \u0026gt; voice. Which is probably not something marriage counselors want to think about very much.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2020. “Book Review: The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/27/book-review-the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work/.

And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you\u0026rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the main reason that speed is important.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren\u0026rsquo;t just about churning out work—they\u0026rsquo;re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.\nIn other words, the main benefit of being fast is that you end up doing different things. Nelson Elhage\u0026rsquo;s point—\u0026ldquo;having faster tools changes how users use a tool\u0026rdquo;—applies across nearly every domain:\n If you respond to your emails quickly instead of slowly, you\u0026rsquo;ll get access to more new opportunities, and end up prioritizing them over whatever you would have done instead. If you make it 10x faster to test your code, you don\u0026rsquo;t just save time waiting on tests—you can start doing test-driven development, discover your mistakes earlier, and save yourself from going down bad paths. If you deploy your new app now instead of next week, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how users like the new features one week earlier, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to feed that knowledge back into future product decisions.  That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn\u0026rsquo;t just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output.

I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.\n Wondrous The Space Within  The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.\n   The task was to make a cylinder. The word \u0026ldquo;pot\u0026rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.\n Beginnings and Endings  The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.\n   The variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.\n Cylinders as Pots  The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.\n   Of particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.\n   The cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).\n Figure 44\nPitchers  It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.\n   A useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.\n   If you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.\n Bowls  Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.\n Pots with Lids Learning to See Style and Voice Utility and Tradition Place Notes Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Illian, Clary. 2012.

Byrne Hobart (a)\n   \u0026ldquo;50%+ focus\u0026rdquo; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower.

It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I\u0026rsquo;d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.\nIn the short term, this made me less efficient, because I\u0026rsquo;d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I\u0026rsquo;d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner\u0026rsquo;s API in a fit of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster, hence getting faster compounding growth.\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Kuhn, Ben. 2020. “Attention Is Your Scarcest Resource.” https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/.

You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\ncrdrost (a)\n   Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulty\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that learning something, forgetting it and then struggling to learn it again leads to faster learning times. It may be that struggle is inherent in the process of learning something complex. If you equate struggle with pain, then I think it makes some sense.\nmikekchar (a)\n   In my ~20 years of experience, the only way to get good at something that is incredibly complex like kernel development, you will need to actually try to build the thing. Over and over and over.\nbob1029 (a)\n See Blub studies.\n In the language learning example, Extensive Reading leads to not only picking up and remembering words, but also collocations, grammar and even cultural beliefs of the speakers of the target language. Single word flash cards miss all of that. Full sentence flashcards do a bit better but still fall short.\nI think the best use for SRS for something like a language or programming is for laying down a scaffold in the very early stages of learning, and then moving to more productive uses of study time as soon as possible.\nAlchemistCamp (a), replying to stared (a)\n This raises an important point in the use of Spaced Repetition System (SRS). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words. Spaced repetition systems lend themselves easily to the study of small chunks of information (eg: definitions) but it is more difficult to apply them to higher-level applications of knowledge and understanding (eg: essay writing).\n I think semantic tree/first principles/physics-based approach (popularly attributed to Elon Musk) is one way to approach it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a really difficult approach and you need a certain level of intelligence and personality to do it well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. I can do it to some extent but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really difficult to hold lots of ideas in tension and to be questioning all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s just not my thinking style.\nThe other approach is what many smart (but non-geniuses) take: the buffet approach. You graze at the table of books, Wikipedia, online articles, and hang out in online communities (like Twitter) to overhear what experts are discussing. The thing about most areas of knowledge is, there\u0026rsquo;s usually only 20% [Pareto principle ] of the subject that matters\u0026ndash;the rest rarely come up (Pareto Principle). To know what 20% to focus on, you need to understand the sociology of the subject matter and what experts think are important. Unlike the previous approach, you won\u0026rsquo;t have watershed-level insights, but you\u0026rsquo;ll know enough to be considered \u0026ldquo;educated\u0026rdquo; on the subject.\nwenc (a)\n Flashcards References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?” n.d.

Unfortunately, very few people seem to be very good at it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a concrete example. Imagine you want to decrease the size of the defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look around at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of decreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a blog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your friends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you\u0026rsquo;re a professional writer, you might write a book on the subject. If you\u0026rsquo;re an academic, you might publish some papers. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this strategy a \u0026ldquo;theory of action\u0026rdquo;: you work forwards from what you know how to do to try to find things you can do that will accomplish your goal.\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it.

Large quotes have their benefits and are simple to capture using bookmarklets (Porter 2022).\nNodes can just be a quote Quotes can live in stand-alone single nodes (eg: The First Lesson). This is multi-purpose:\n When in doubt, make the node smaller. Easier to link to specific quotes: Suppose a reader clicks on a link and arrives on a page with five quotes visible. This may confuse the reader. Which of the visible quotes is the one to which the link pointed? Works in a transclusion model better than larger nodes  Links  Preserve links in the original quote to point to the original location or to a node representing the same idea. Wrap added links with square brackets just as you would with additional text.  Links Show favicons alongside links Favicons are nice additions to links. They provide visual context to where the reader expects the link to take them. Include them alongside external links.

Too thin? Are they the same thickness from top to bottom? How similar are the six cylinders? Do some look different than the others? In what ways?   If you notice anything you want to work on, go to step 1 and focus on that aspect of the cylinders when you throw them again.  Example: Pulls Choose one or more of the following:\n Limit yourself to three pulls \u0026ldquo;Pull as high as you can\u0026rdquo; (SinkingJunk 2016) \u0026ldquo;Pulling large amounts of clay (getting \u0026gt;50% of your height on your first pull)\u0026rdquo; (SinkingJunk 2016) \u0026ldquo;Try to make 6 inch cylinders from one pound of clay. Realistically you\u0026rsquo;re not going to do it (it\u0026rsquo;s not easy, Idk if I could do it consistently) But it gives you a goal. You want even pulls and consistent thickness the whole way through.\u0026rdquo; (youre_being_creepy 2016)  Example: Intention  Another thing is to first draw a silhouette, whatever type of piece and shape you want, and try to make that shape.

Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect [Spacing effect]. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe basis for spaced repetition research was laid by Hermann Ebbinghaus, who suggested that information loss over time follows a forgetting curve [Forgetting curve], but that forgetting could be reset with repetition based on active recall.\n(“Spaced Repetition” 2022)\n Also see Testing effect.\nSpaced repetition is how I bring intention to memory. I remember the things I choose to remember, rather than only the things I happen to remember. It aids in making learning and memory conscious, effortful, process.\nNote The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. Spaced repetition is capable of aiding both remembering names and deeper understanding. However, the two require different approaches:\n Remember something when prompted (e.g. knowing the definition of a word while reading) Bring an idea to mind in context (e.g. using a word while writing)  It\u0026rsquo;s most effective when the practice mirrors, as closely as is possible, the way the knowledge will be applied (see also Desirable difficulty).\nTools My preferred solution is org-fc. However, Anki is, as far as I can tell, the most popular and well known. I used Anki exclusively prior to switching to org-fc.\nWhy isn\u0026rsquo;t spaced repetition more popular? As far as I can tell, from my own experience and reading what others have written on the topic:\n  It\u0026rsquo;s not popular because it isn\u0026rsquo;t popular\nPeople are not strategic by default and aren\u0026rsquo;t likely to go out on their own to pursue novel (to them at least) ways of doing something. They\u0026rsquo;re much more likely to do what they see others doing.\n  Other, more popular, learning methods work well enough\nSpaced repetition isn\u0026rsquo;t the only effective way to learn a topic. Additionally, those alternatives often feel better in the moment or give the impression that they\u0026rsquo;re more effective:\n Of course, [cramming] is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can\u0026rsquo;t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I\u0026rsquo;m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠\nBecause it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠12⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! [\u0026hellip;]\n(Branwen 2009)\n   It\u0026rsquo;s hard to write good, effective, cards\n One reason this can be frustrating is you\u0026rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you\u0026rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.\n(Borretti 2023)\n   Spaced repetition is a form of delayed gratification\n  \u0026ldquo;For spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit\u0026rdquo; (Borretti 2023) and it\u0026rsquo;s often a difficult habit to form\n  On writing cards Cards should be small Cards, like Evergreen notes, should be atomic; they should test a single, small, idea.\n Write Atomic Flashcards Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible  Approach an idea from more than one direction  Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations Write Two-Way Questions  Flashcards Definition    position ease box interval due     front 2.05 8 178.13 2023-12-18T17:22:55Z   back 2.95 6 144.66 2023-08-13T09:16:21Z    Spaced repetition\nBack An evidence-based learning technique, usually performed with flashcards, which exploits the Spacing effect and Testing effect.

The links between outcomes are explained by \u0026ldquo;rationales\u0026rdquo; or statements of why one outcome is thought to be a prerequisite for another.\nThe innovation of Theory of Change lies (1) in making the distinction between desired and actual outcomes and (2) in requiring stakeholders to model their desired outcomes before they decide on forms of intervention to achieve those outcomes.\n(“Theory of Change” 2022)\n   Let\u0026rsquo;s take a concrete example. Imagine you want to decrease the size of the defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look around at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of decreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a blog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your friends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you\u0026rsquo;re a professional writer, you might write a book on the subject. If you\u0026rsquo;re an academic, you might publish some papers. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this strategy a \u0026ldquo;theory of action\u0026rdquo; [Theory of action]: you work forwards from what you know how to do to try to find things you can do that will accomplish your goal.\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026rdquo;\n(Swartz 2010)\n Steps These steps are based on (“How Does Theory of Change Work?” n.d.). The ordering, with the exception of starting from Goals, is a recommendation as opposed to a hard rule. For instance, you may need to revisit previous steps as you progress if you identify previously unknown flaws or opportunities in your reasoning.\n Goals: Identify and agree upon long term goal(s) Outcomes: Create an outcomes framework by Backcasting from long term goal(s) and explain why these preconditions are necessary and sufficient Assumptions: Make assumptions explicit Evidence: Develop indicators which will measure the outcomes and assess your performance (see OKR) Action: Identify your next steps based on the outcome Convince: Create a narrative which explains the logic of this plan and use it to convince necessary stakeholders  As compared to a theory of action Based on (Tyrrel 2019) and (Swartz 2010):\n Theory of action  Works forward from where you are right now toward the goal Focuses on what you will do to try and affect change   Theory of change  Works backward (Backcast) from the goal to the present; not you \u0026ndash; the present Describes how change happens in a System, regardless of anything you do or don\u0026rsquo;t do, and then attempts to integrate you and your potential changes into that framework    Flashcards Describe    position ease box interval due     front 3.10 7 411.39 2024-08-25T01:02:57Z   back 2.95 6 161.02 2023-08-25T13:44:44Z    Theory of change\nBack  A model of how change in the direction of a goal or destination happens within a system A plan for enacting change built by Backcasting from the desired goal to the present.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.\nNote that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.\nWhy Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.\nI expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment. I chose to attempt a sleep schedule called dual core (a), which has 5.5 sleeping hours per day, as it was supposed2 to be possible to maintain the schedule indefinitely.\n   Sleep Schedule Hours Awake Per Day Expected Years Left1 Expected Waking Years Left     Monophasic 15 50.4 31.50   Dual Core 1 18.5 50.4 38.85    As the table indicates: sleeping for 3.5 fewer hours daily equates to an increased waking-time life expectancy of 7.35 years. But what would I do with those hours?\nGiven that this was a trial, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time. I expected that I would be exhausted as I adapted (a) to the new sleep schedule.\nThe Trial Sleep Schedule The dual core (a) sleep schedule I attempted was composed of three sleeping times per day.\n   Name Start time End time Duration (hours)     Core 1 22:00 01:30 3.5   Core 2 05:30 07:00 1.5   Nap 13:30 14:00 0.5    I maintained this schedule for 40 days from April 4th, 2021 through June 13th, 2021.\nMeasuring the Impact I opted to do no cognitive tests, etc, during this trial. I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.\nRetrospective How I Felt Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is repartitioning (a). In short, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases3. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it\u0026rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.\nNonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (531 (a)), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I\u0026rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.\nOverall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn\u0026rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I\u0026rsquo;d say that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a negative impact.\nPhysical Symptoms Sleepiness Suprisingly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired \u0026ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.\nDifficulty Waking Up I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (\u0026gt;25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.\n\u0026ldquo;Third Person\u0026rdquo; Feelings Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m watching a TV show right now\u0026rdquo; before the show is over? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.\nI would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; of myself rather than just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.\nHeadaches I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I\u0026rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren\u0026rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.\nSticking to the Schedule Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc4. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using Sleep as Android (a) and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.\nQuality of Sleep I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.\nSleep as Android tracks the duration of \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; (a) and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.\nHow I Seemed to Those Around Me I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she\u0026rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.\nSleep Schedule Going Forward I\u0026rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.\nI had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I\u0026rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there\u0026rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.\nMore and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn\u0026rsquo;t have more to show for it. I\u0026rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours. If I don\u0026rsquo;t, then why not just keep sleeping through them?\nTo that end I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my focus from \u0026ldquo;get more hours\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;do more with the hours I have\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll take another look at polyphasic sleep once I get to the point where I feel I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the hours I already have.\nFlashcards Backlinks  Matthew D.

They\u0026rsquo;re a way of blasting through Ugh fields.\n   The Monthly Newsletter as a Thinking Tool (a) by Matt Freeman\nThis post.\n  (a) (a) by Milan Griffes\nI like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that could be automated through some \u0026quot;presubmit\u0026quot; step of the publishing process. I've looked around but haven't found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links. I expect that I won't bother to include them so long as I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain content will be present and determined readers will be able to consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.\nI also notice that the author includes (sometimes long) relevant quotes from links they cite (a), or even a long quote and nothing else (a). I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the goal of \u0026quot;(a)\u0026quot;.\n  Meaningful Rest (a) by Neel Nanda\n An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, these lists are basically disjoint!\n  Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower. (I elaborate far more on this model in this post (a))\n   Productivity (a) by Sam Altman\nThere is a lot of good advice in here. I especially appreciated the point about avoiding productivity porn. \u0026quot;Chasing productivity for its own sake isn't helpful\u0026quot;. I've done that chase before and at best it's a time sink and at worst it's a form of self-deception. As such, I want to be sure to do more than just read the article and then proceed with my life as it was before. I've had more success integrating change gradually and building on small accomplishments as opposed to attempting to overhaul all of my habits at once. I'll try to tackle one piece of advice weekly, of my own highlights from the article, and attempt to work it into my life that week.\n  Noticing the Taste of Lotus (a) by Valentine\nThe idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention. The importance of, and ways to maintain, focus and attention are a common theme in several other articles recently (at least recent to me and my discovery of them).\nThe author's follow-up review of their own writing distinguishes a few claims made in the piece:\n   External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are lotuses.)\n  It's possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can notice the taste of lotuses.)\n  It's good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned with others' goals regardless of how they relate to our own.\n  If you notice this, you'll find yourself wanting to spit out lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.\n   I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims. Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There's a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio (a), for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories, throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It's not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it's a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I've realigned my goals around the game and that those new goals won't take me where I want to go.\n  Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software Developer (a) by Zachary Betz\nI think the author makes a good point. Perhaps I'm less interested than others would be as I've seen these ideas already expressed by Cal Newport.\n  Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger) (a) by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo;; naru is \u0026ldquo;becoming,\u0026rdquo; and the form naritai is \u0026ldquo;want to become.\u0026rdquo; Together it means, \u0026ldquo;I want to become stronger,\u0026rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I\u0026rsquo;ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player\u0026mdash;or after you lose an important match, but you haven\u0026rsquo;t given up\u0026mdash;or after you win an important match, but you\u0026rsquo;re not a ninth-dan player yet\u0026mdash;or after you\u0026rsquo;ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence\n   Something to Protect (a) by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.\n   Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now (a) by Alexy Guzey\n This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing not only helps you to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.\n   Making Yourself Small (a) by Helen\n .. probably the most important thing is your mental/emotional state - a friend suggested \u0026ldquo;not wanting to startle a small bird\u0026rdquo; as an mindset to inhabit, to encourage yourself to become \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo;.\n   Seeing the Smoke (a) by Jacob Falkovich\n As Eliezer reminded us, most people sitting alone in a room will quickly get out if it starts filling up with smoke. But if two other people in the room seem unperturbed, almost everyone will stay put. That is the result of a famous experiment from the 1960s and its replications \u0026mdash; people will sit and nervously look around at their peers for 20 minutes even as thick smoke starts obscuring their vision.\n  In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?\nExponential growth is hard for people to grasp. Most people answer \u0026lsquo;24\u0026rsquo; to the above question, or something random like \u0026lsquo;35\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive to people that the lily pads could be barely noticeable on day 44 and yet completely cover the lake on day 48.\n   Be Impatient (a) by Ben Kuhn\n Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n   Attention is your scarcest resource (a) by Ben Kuhn\n \u0026quot;The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:\n\u0026lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.\n10-50% focus: \u0026ldquo;meets expectations,\u0026rdquo; gets regular raises.\n50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.\u0026quot;\nByrne Hobart (a)\n\u0026quot;50%+ focus\u0026quot; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start habitually asking \u0026quot;how could this go faster?\u0026quot; It\u0026rsquo;s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time\u0026mdash;or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/links/","summary":"Links 2021 May   Theory of Change (a) by Aaron Swartz\n A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action \u0026mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026quot;\n   Cached Selves (a) by Anna Salamon","title":"Links"},{"content":"In the spirit of personal time tracking (a), I thought I would share my method as well. I\u0026rsquo;ll write a follow-up, or amend this post, with the relevant source code at some point.\nI started tracking my time a few months ago so I could have data to back up questions about how much I time I was giving to studying, working, cooking, chores, friends, etc. The solutions I found for tracking personal time didn\u0026rsquo;t mesh with the way I wanted to track time:\n Interface The UI should be intuitive and simple; after all, there are only a handful of actions I care about.

Portability I need to be able to track time wherever I am. The ideal solution would be on my phone or watch.  I ended up implementing my own solution which combines Tasker (a) as a front-end on my Android phone with Google Calendar (a) as a back-end.\n\n\nI\u0026rsquo;ve exposed three functions through Tasker (in order from left to right):\n Time Track: Start Opens a category menu and starts tracking time for the selected category. Notify Queries the calendar and displays the sum length of all events, grouped by category, which ended today between 00:00 and 23:59. This does not include the current time tracking duration. Time Track: Stop Stops tracking time; creates an event in the calendar.  \n\nClicking the first button opens a menu which lists time tracking categories I\u0026rsquo;ve used before. I can also add a new category, by entering the new category name into the text field in the lower left, or remove an existing category by long-pressing the name.\nThe active time tracking is shown in a notification, which includes the option to move the start time forward or backward in increments of one minute. I\u0026rsquo;ve also included the notification generated by pressing the second button in this image.\n\nI also have a script which sends me an email every Sunday evening with a daily breakdown and a reminder notification which is triggered after one minutes, then every 15 minutes, when I\u0026rsquo;m not tracking time.\nGoing forward, I\u0026rsquo;d like to analyze the data once I have a solid month or so where I\u0026rsquo;m using the tool regularly.\n  Whether Google Calendar is private is left as an exercise to the reader.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/tracking-time-with-tasker-and-google-calendar/","summary":"In the spirit of personal time tracking (a), I thought I would share my method as well.
