Make it vegan by either removing or substitute Vegan fish sauce.\nIngredients Ingredient Notes Quantity Whole peeled tomatoes Preferably imported D.O.P. San Marzano1 3.3 l Olive oil Extra-virgin 60 ml Butter 55 g Garlic Minced 45 g Red pepper flakes 1 g Oregano Dried 3 g Carrot Medium; cut into large chunks 1 Onion Medium; halved 1 Basil Stem; fresh 1 Fish sauce 15 ml Parsley or Basil Fresh minced 5 g Black pepper Fresh ground To taste Salt Kosher To taste Steps Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300°F (165°C). Place tomatoes in a large bowl. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes by squeezing them in your fingers until pieces no larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer 3 cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator until step 4.\nHeat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter is melted. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil, and stir to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat.\nCover Dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. Cook, stirring once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red, 5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or the browned bits begin to turn too dark).\nRemove from oven. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots, and basil stems. Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add fish sauce, if using. Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in minced herbs along with additional olive oil as desired. Serve immediately, or allow to cool at room temperature, transfer to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Sauce can also be frozen in sealed containers for up to 6 months. To reheat, warm very gently in a saucepan with 1/2 cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through.\nBibliography References López-Alt, James Kenji. n.d. “The Best Italian-American Tomato Sauce Recipe.” Serious Eats.

Like this:\nTry to mine minerals. Recruit lots of soldiers. Recruit lots of workers. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea for a mineral site to have between 22 and 30 workers. Workers are recruited at a command center. Soldiers are recruited at a barracks. In order to build anything, you need workers. In order to build anything, you also need minerals. For that matter, in order to recruit more units, you need minerals. Workers mine minerals. Minerals should be used immediately; if you\u0026rsquo;re storing them, you\u0026rsquo;re wasting them. (Of course, the above tips only work for Terrans.)\nOkay, great. Now you have a command center and a bunch of workers. You want a bunch of soldiers. What do you do?\nWhy, let\u0026rsquo;s look at our tips. \u0026ldquo;Try to mine minerals.\u0026rdquo; Okay, you start mining minerals. \u0026ldquo;Recruit lots of soldiers.\u0026rdquo; You can\u0026rsquo;t do that, because you don\u0026rsquo;t have a barracks, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to build one. \u0026ldquo;Recruit lots of workers.\u0026rdquo; But wait, recruiting workers and building a barracks both require minerals.

This could take the form of inversion-of-control, a domain-specific language, or just a very opinionated and internally-coupled library. It\u0026rsquo;s a spectrum; there\u0026rsquo;s no hard line between the two. One way to tell if something is a framework is to ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Could I use this in combination with something else like it? Or has it established ways of doing things that are mutually-exclusive with other ways those things might be done?\u0026rdquo;\nFrameworks\u0026rsquo; key trait is that they impose limitations on the programmer. Rather than providing a set of new things the programmer can do, they establish a boundary on the things the programmer can do. In exchange for flexibility they often eliminate boilerplate, establish a touchstone for new libraries to be built on top of them, and allow a programmer\u0026rsquo;s skills to become more transferable between projects. In fact, sometimes the limitations themselves are desirable! After all, type systems are nothing but a way of imposing limitations on code. Limitations are not intrinsically bad.\nHowever. When you write a framework that you expect others to build real projects with (i.e. it isn\u0026rsquo;t just a toy), you are taking on a much greater responsibility than you would with a library.\nA framework, usually, must predict ahead of time every kind of thing a user of it might need to do within its walls. For each piece of the puzzle that it assimilates into its own vocabulary, it must take over responsibility for that set of tasks. It must not only take care that every task that needs to be done in it can be done, it ideally needs to offer a better way of doing those things than the way they would be done normally. Otherwise, why use it?\n[\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] With a library, the good bits can be used piecemeal without having to throw the whole thing away because of one problem that nobody\u0026rsquo;s ever going to fix in the trunk.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my point: frameworks aren\u0026rsquo;t always bad, but they are a much bigger risk - for both the creators and the users - than libraries are. If your framework can be a library without losing much, it probably should be. If you don\u0026rsquo;t work at a major tech company, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or energy to give a framework all of the attention it requires. Libraries aren\u0026rsquo;t everything, but they should be preferred.\nBibliography References Smith, Brandon. n.d. “Write Libraries, Not Frameworks.” Accessed December 4, 2023. https://www.brandons.me/blog/libraries-not-frameworks.

Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown on the date where it applies. This is a frequent misunderstanding by Org users. In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when you want to start working on an action item.\n(“Deadlines and Scheduling (The Org Manual)” n.d.)\nItems have just the one SCHEUDLED property. They can have more than one timestamp; however, org-mode increments all of the timestamps when you mark the item as DONE (org-auto-repeat-maybe) \u0026mdash; not just today\u0026rsquo;s timestamp.\nMy hack-ish fix is to have duplicate TODOs. That is, for an event that has a different time on weekdays and weekends:\n* Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-11-27 Mon 10:00-10:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-11-28 Tue 10:00-10:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-11-29 Wed 10:00-10:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-11-30 Thu 10:00-10:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-12-01 Fri 10:00-10:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-12-02 Sat 08:00-08:30 ++1w\u0026gt; * Do the thing SCHEDULED: \u0026lt;2023-12-03 Sun 08:00-08:30 ++1w\u0026gt; This would be annoying if I used the built-in clocktable which would show a separate line-item for each TODO:\n#+BEGIN: clocktable :block \u0026#34;2023-W48\u0026#34; ... #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2023-11-28 Tue 09:37], for week 2023-W48. | File | Headline | Time | |----------------+------------------+--------| | | ALL *Total time* | *3:30* | |----------------+------------------+--------| | Personal TODOs | *File time* | *3:30* | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | | | Do the thing | 0:30 | #+END: Instead, I use clocktable-by-category (a) which supports merging duplicate headings into one line-item with a duration equal to the sum of the duration of the duplicates:\n#+BEGIN: clocktable-by-category :block \u0026#34;2023-W48\u0026#34; ... #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2023-11-28 Tue 09:37], for week 2023-W48. | Category | Headline | Time | |----------------+------------------+--------| | | ALL *Total time* | *3:30* | |----------------+------------------+--------| | Personal TODOs | *Category time* | *3:30* | | | Do the thing | 3:30 | #+END: Bibliography References “Deadlines and Scheduling (The Org Manual).” n.d.

I was mostly describing an end state, though, and reasons why it\u0026rsquo;s a good place to be, but what should you do if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in being more consistent?\nOnly say things you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable fully standing behind [\u0026hellip;] only saying things you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable fully standing behind. Many people especially when irritable, sleep deprived, or surprised, can quickly spit out a consequence that is harsher than is fair. Things like, \u0026ldquo;if you don\u0026rsquo;t stop this minute it\u0026rsquo;s no desserts for a week!\u0026rdquo; Then when the threat fails the consequence feels too extreme, and they don\u0026rsquo;t follow through. If someone read my earlier post and decided they needed to stand by their quickly distributed threats I\u0026rsquo;d be pretty sad, and not expect this to make things better. Instead, any consequences need to be reasonable and proportionate, where you feel fair when you do have to enforce them (which, ideally, is rarely).\nOne thing that can be helpful is having a system of simple stock responses. The simplest is just a stern voice. If you reserve speaking firmly for rare circumstances, then saying something intensely and seriously can feel very significant.\nTime outs can also work well: we use a system where we make it clear what needs to change (\u0026ldquo;stop shouting\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;brush your teeth\u0026rdquo;), count to three, slowly and clearly, stopping if they do what we want, and if we get to three then it\u0026rsquo;s time out. Serious things can be time out immediately. If you reliably use these, then not only does the kid understand how they work and what they mean but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to come up with a novel appropriate response at a time when you\u0026rsquo;re very stressed (\u0026ldquo;Do not bite me. That\u0026rsquo;s time out.)\nEven better, though, is avoiding commands and threats entirely. If they\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with a puzzle and they ask you to read to them, you can say you\u0026rsquo;ll read once they clean up the puzzle (and depending on age maybe help them clean it up). They probably want you to read badly enough that they clean up, but if not that\u0026rsquo;s ok too. You\u0026rsquo;re using something they want you to do as leverage to get them do something they should do, but you\u0026rsquo;re also teaching them the general practice of cleaning up one thing before getting out another.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t make unnecessary commitments Instead of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go downstairs and get your bear\u0026rdquo; maybe \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go downstairs and look for your bear.\u0026rdquo; While with adults we understand that when a person says they\u0026rsquo;ll do something they mean they\u0026rsquo;ll put in a reasonable effort and may fail if the task is surprisingly difficult or if factors outside their control intervene, I find that with kids being explicit about likely failure possibilities is helpful. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go see if we have any more cheese sticks.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, adults understand that you don\u0026rsquo;t have authority over everyone around you, but with kids phrasing like \u0026ldquo;Mama can read to you when we get home\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t as good as \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll ask Mama if she\u0026rsquo;ll read to you when we get home.\u0026rdquo; Or, even better, \u0026ldquo;when we get home you can ask Mama if she\u0026rsquo;ll read to you.\u0026rdquo;1\nRules should work in a range of situations The next skill is thinking of rules that will work well in a range of situations. These can be explicit rules (\u0026ldquo;hold hands when crossing the street (a)) or implicit ones (saying yes/no without explaining reasoning but following a pattern you could explain if asked). I find thinking \u0026ldquo;saying yes/no no means saying the same thing in this sort of situation in general\u0026rdquo; is a helpful way of thinking about it.2\nThis is another case where preparation can help. Before going to the beach, think about what rule you\u0026rsquo;ll have for the water: \u0026ldquo;stay with a grown up the whole time\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;only go in the water with a grown up\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;only go in the water by yourself right in front of the lifeguard.\u0026rdquo; If you notice yourself giving inconsistent answers to questions, take some time later to figure out if there\u0026rsquo;s a rule that would work better (\u0026ldquo;one short video each night, after dinner\u0026rdquo;). It\u0026rsquo;s ok, and expected, to end up with a rule that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match some of your previous decisions, just try to get a rule you\u0026rsquo;ll be happy with. (\u0026ldquo;I know we did let you stand on the table sometimes, but from now on there\u0026rsquo;s no standing on the table.\u0026rdquo;)\nThe easiest rules to be consistent with are the ones our culture has for adults, since you and everyone else more or less know what these are. As kids are generally less capable, tall, intelligent, prudent, etc than the people these rules have evolved for, you are going to need to make accomodations. But I find that starting with a perspective of treating kids like adults unless there is a reason otherwise works well.\nFollow through on what you said The better you get at the two skills above the easier this is: you\u0026rsquo;re saying fewer things that need to be backed up, the consequences you\u0026rsquo;ve promised are ones that generally seem fair, and your kids generally understand the patterns and choose to avoid the consequences. But they will still test to see if maybe the boundary has retracted while they weren\u0026rsquo;t looking, and when they do you need to be firm. Sometimes this is unpleasant for both of you but it makes the rest of your interactions far better.\n(One way that poverty is harmful, and that parenting while well off is unfairly easy, is that external factors can keep you from being reliable for your kids. If I tell them I will do something I have enough control that I can make sure it happens, but if I had work with less flexibility, less money, or generally less slack this would be much harder. Similarly, it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to be predictable when you\u0026rsquo;re tired, hungry, overworked, or otherwise not at your best. If I tell my kid no and they decide to test me by tantruming, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be able to be stubborn longer than they can. But I\u0026rsquo;m only able to be in a good mental state for that because I\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky in how well my life has gone.)\nBibliography References Kaufman, Jeff. n.d. “How to Parent More Predictably.” Accessed November 6, 2023. https://www.jefftk.com/p/how-to-parent-more-predictably.

Not only is that unpleasant for you, it\u0026rsquo;s unpleasant for them: at a low level they know that if they put themself into this painful state they\u0026rsquo;ll get something they want more than they dislike being in that state, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make being in that state nice for them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also really important to limit your use of commands: once they\u0026rsquo;ll consistently follow requests it\u0026rsquo;s tempting to use that a lot, but that\u0026rsquo;s not fair to them or good for their development as an independent person.\n(In general, I try to avoid using commands or making absolute statements about something I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing.

Our aims were to investigate the proportion of infants who sleep through the night (6- or 8-hour sleep blocks) at ages 6 and 12 months in a longitudinal cohort and to explore associations between sleeping through the night, mental and psychomotor development, maternal mood, and breastfeeding.\nMethods At 6 and 12 months of age, maternal reports were used to assess the longest period of uninterrupted infant sleep and feeding method (n = 388). Two different criteria were used to determine if infants slept through the night: 6 and 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Mental and psychomotor developmental indices (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and maternal mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) were measured at 6, 12, and 36 months of age.\nResults Using a definition of either 6 or 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, we found that 27.9% to 57.0% of 6- and 12-month-old infants did not sleep through the night. Linear regressions revealed no significant associations between sleeping through the night and concurrent or later mental development, psychomotor development, or maternal mood (P \u0026gt; .05). However, sleeping through the night was associated with a much lower rate of breastfeeding (P \u0026lt; .0001).\nConclusions Considering that high proportions of infants did not sleep through the night and that no associations were found between uninterrupted sleep, mental or psychomotor development, and maternal mood, expectations for early sleep consolidation could be moderated.\nIntroduction For most parents, the time when infants should consolidate their sleep (a process often called \u0026ldquo;sleeping through the night\u0026rdquo;) is a major concern. Sleeping through the night is a different concept from total nocturnal sleep duration (which refers to the total sleep duration during the night), and it is also different from total sleep duration (which refers to the total sleep duration in a 24-hour period). Sleeping through the night is instead defined as the longest period of uninterrupted sleep without parental intervention (ie, sleep blocks of a specific duration, typically 6 or 8 hours). This is widely considered a developmental milestone that should be achieved at approximately age 5 or 6 months. However, researchers in several studies have reported that not all infants conform to this classic developmental timeline. Although studies show that increasing percentages of infants sleep through the night as they grow up, they also show major interindividual differences.\nSleeping through the night at age 6 to 12 months is generally considered the gold standard in Western industrialized nations, and behavioral sleep training (such as controlled crying) is popular among parents and professionals.\nResults Age (months) Uninterrupted sleep criterion (hours) Slept through night (%) Didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep through night (%) 6 6 62.4% 37.6% 6 8 43.0% 57.0% 12 6 72.1% 27.9% 12 8 56.6% 43.4% Age (months) Uninterrupted sleep criterion (hours) % of \u0026ldquo;Slept through night\u0026rdquo; % of \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep through night\u0026rdquo; 6 6 55.0% 80.8% 6 8 49.1% 76.5% 12 6 23.8% 56.4% 12 8 22.1% 47.1% Bibliography References Pennestri, Marie-Hélène, Christine Laganière, Andrée-Anne Bouvette-Turcot, Irina Pokhvisneva, Meir Steiner, Michael J.

It is based on our experience and recommendations we got/read. This will likely not work for everybody everywhere. If you add up the numbers for more than two children it quickly becomes that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add up even if one parent takes care of the children full time. There are some synergies between children and one also gets better with practice but we still ran into sleep deficits and lack of couple time.\n0 years old 0-0.5 years The first month is all about getting used to life with the new baby. Only the most important things are done. Otherwise the following applies roughly: 1st week: The mother stays in bed with the baby most of the time and takes care of herself and the baby. The father takes care of everything else. 2nd week: The mother mainly takes care of herself and the baby, but outside of the bed, but continues to sleep a lot; she may already be taking care of the other children while playing. The father takes care of everything else. 3rd week: The mother takes care of herself, the baby, and the other children, but sleeps more often; she may take care of some household chores. The father takes care of everything else. 4th week: The mother takes care of the normal duties with support from the father, but still takes one nap a day.\nChildhood after the first month: The child must be fully cared for. Bathing twice a week (2 x 0.5 = 1) Wash 2 times a week (2 x 0.25 = 0.5) Feed every 2 hours daily (also at night) (7 x 12 x 0.5 = 42) Diaper every 2 hours daily (not at night) (7 x 8 x 0.25 = 14) Engage(\\*) 1 hour a day (30 minutes of which are active) (7 x 1.0 = 7) 1 new topic(\\*\\*) daily (7 x 0.25 = 1.75) 1 course(\\*\\*) per week (including arrival and departure) (26 in the half-year) (1 x 3.0 = 3) Time spent per week: 69.25 hours\n(\\*) engage means letting the child play or occupy itself or (called active) playing together. (\\*\\*) see spreadsheet. Topics are activities done or skills acquired, they are done alone or with the parent(s). Courses are periodic activities typically organized by a teacher or trainer.\n0.5-1 years While breastfeeding, the baby has become accustomed to meal times.

Now, the first comprehensive study of energy use over the human life span has quantified their burn rate: Infants between the ages of 9 and 15 months expend a stunning 50% more energy in 1 day than adults do, adjusted for body size. These wee dynamos consume and use up energy even faster than pregnant women and teenage boys, most likely to fuel their energetically expensive brains and organs.\nBut children also burn out fast. Their high metabolisms make them particularly vulnerable to stunted growth and disease if they don\u0026rsquo;t get the calories they need. Their cells may also metabolize drugs faster than those of adults, which means they may need more frequent doses. On the flip side, adults older than 60 begin to use less energy daily than younger people, and they may require less food or lower doses of medications, especially after age 90 when they use 26% less energy than middle-age people.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nChildren\u0026rsquo;s metabolic rates stay high until age 5, but the rate slowly begins to glide down until it plateaus around age 20. Interestingly, adult rates are stable until age 60, when they begin to decline.\n(“Little Kids Burn so Much Energy, They’re like a Different Species, Study Finds” n.d.)\nThis is well known in emergency medicine. Not only do kids burn out quick, they also burn out completely because they, unlike adults, don\u0026rsquo;t keep a reserve. This applies to homeostasis, too.\nConsequently: young trauma victims that \u0026ldquo;look OK\u0026rdquo; need to be very closely attended to, because what you might be seeing is a kid burning the very last of their energy reserves just to maintain homeostasis, and they will NOT degrade gracefully once they\u0026rsquo;re out of energy \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;ll just go right into the deep end of shock.

I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.\nNote that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I\u0026rsquo;m also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The \u0026ldquo;one weird trick (a)\u0026rdquo; is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOne complication is that real life activities tend not to have a single, one-dimensional, objective to optimize for. Another is that what makes someone good at a real life activity tends to be poorly understood (by comparison to games and sports) even in relation to a specific, well defined, goal.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn real life, if you want to be (for example) \u0026ldquo;a good speaker\u0026rdquo;, that might mean that you want to give informative talks that help people learn or that you want to give entertaining talks that people enjoy or that you want to give keynotes at prestigious conferences or that you want to be asked to give talks for $50k an appearance. Those are all different objectives, with different strategies for achieving them and for some particular mistake (e.g., spending 8 minutes on introducing yourself during a 20 minute talk), it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what that means with respect to your goal.\nAnother thing that makes games, at least mainstream ones, easy to optimize for is that they tend to have a lot of aficionados who have obsessively tried to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s effective. This means that if you want to improve, unless you\u0026rsquo;re trying to be among the top in the world, you can simply figure out what resources have worked for other people, pick one up, read/watch it, and then practice\nIf you want to become a good speaker and you have a specific definition of \u0026ldquo;a good speaker\u0026rdquo; in mind, there still isn\u0026rsquo;t an obvious path forward. Great speakers will give directly contradictory advice (e.g., avoid focusing on presentation skills vs. practice presentation skills). Relatively few people obsessively try to improve and figure out what works, which results in a lack of rigorous curricula for improving. However, this also means that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to improve in percentile terms since relatively few people are trying to improve at all (a).\nDespite all of the caveats above, my belief is that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there\u0026rsquo;s so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities. [\u0026hellip;] In most real life activities, there\u0026rsquo;s almost no one who puts in a level of delibrate practice equivalent to someone who goes down to their local table tennis club and practices two hours a week, let alone someone like a top pro, who might seriously train for four hours a day.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMost people consider doing 30 practice runs for a talk to be absurd, a totally obsessive amount of practice, but I think Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you\u0026rsquo;re giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that\u0026rsquo;s 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it\u0026rsquo;s not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections). One thing to note that this level of practice, considered obessive when giving a talk, still pales in comparison to the amount of time a middling table tennis club player will spend practicing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOne thing to note here is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to actually track what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and not just guess at what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. [\u0026hellip;]\nAnyway, this is sort of an odd post for me to write since I think that culturally, we care a bit too much about productivity in the U.S., especially in places I\u0026rsquo;ve lived recently (NYC \u0026amp; SF). But at a personal level, higher productivity doing work or chores doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be converted into more work or chores, it can also be converted into more vacation time or more time doing whatever you value.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nKevin Burke has noted that when he coaches youth basketball, some children don\u0026rsquo;t want to do drills that they think make them look foolish (e.g., avoiding learning to dribble with their off hand even during drills where everyone is dribbling poorly because they\u0026rsquo;re using their off hand). When I spent a lot of time in a climbing gym with a world class coach who would regularly send a bunch of kids to nationals and some to worlds, I\u0026rsquo;d observe the same thing in his classes \u0026ndash; kids, even ones who are nationally or internationally competitive, would sometimes avoid doing things because they were afraid it would make them look foolish to their peers. The coach\u0026rsquo;s solution in those cases was to deliberately make the kid look extremely foolish and tell them that it\u0026rsquo;s better to look stupid now than at nationals.\nBibliography References Luu, Dan. n.d. “95\\%-Ile Isn’t That Good.” Accessed October 27, 2023. https://danluu.com/p95-skill/.

Speed enables new workflows \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to find low hanging fruit on \u0026rsquo;execution speed\u0026rsquo; and not so easy to find low hanging fruit on \u0026lsquo;having better ideas\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;. Thoughts Notes The top reasons I see people say that productivity doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter (or is actually bad) fall into one of three buckets:\nWorking on the right thing [Work on the right thing] is more important than working quickly Speed at X doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because you don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time doing X Thinking about productivity is bad and you should \u0026ldquo;live life\u0026rdquo; Working on the right thing is more important than working quickly I certainly agree that working on the right thing is important, but increasing velocity doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop you from working on the right thing. If anything, each of these is a force multiplier for the other. Having strong execution skills becomes more impactful if you\u0026rsquo;re good at picking the right problem and vice versa.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that the gains from picking the right problem can be greater than the gains from having better tactical execution because the gains from picking the right problem can be unbounded, but it\u0026rsquo;s also much easier to improve tactical execution and doing so also helps with picking the right problem because having faster execution lets you experiment more quickly, which helps you find the right problem.\nA concrete example of this is a project I worked on to quantify the machine health of the fleet. The project discovered a number of serious issues (a decent fraction of hosts were actively corrupting data or had a performance problem that would increase tail latency by \u0026gt; 2 orders of magnitude, or both). This was considered serious enough that a new team was created to deal with the problem.\nIn retrospect, my first attempts at quantifying the problem were doomed and couldn\u0026rsquo;t have really worked (or not in a reasonable amount of time, anyway). I spent a few weeks cranking through ideas that couldn\u0026rsquo;t work and a critical part of getting to the idea that did work after \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; a few weeks was being able to quickly try out and discard ideas that didn\u0026rsquo;t work. In part of a previous post, I described how long a tiny part of that process took and multiple people objected to that being impossibly fast in internet comments.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAnyway, despite operating at a rate that some internet commenters thought was impossible, it took me weeks of dead ends to find something that worked. If I was doing things at a speed that people thought was normal, I suspect it would\u0026rsquo;ve taken long enough to find a feasible solution that I would\u0026rsquo;ve dropped the problem after spending maybe one or two quarters on it. The number of plausible-ish seeming dead ends was probably not unrelated to why the problem was still an open problem despite being a critical issue for years. Of course, someone who\u0026rsquo;s better at having ideas than me could\u0026rsquo;ve solved the problem without the dead ends, but as we discussed earlier, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to find low hanging fruit on \u0026ldquo;execution speed\u0026rdquo; and not so easy to find low hanging fruit on \u0026ldquo;having better ideas\u0026rdquo;. However, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to, to a limited extent, simulate someone who has better ideas than me by being able to quickly try out and discard ideas (I also work on having better ideas, but I think it makes sense to go after the easier high ROI wins that are available as well). Being able to try out ideas quickly also improves the rate at which I can improve at having better ideas since a key part of that is building intuition by getting feedback on what works.\n[emphasis mine]\nSpeed at X doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because you don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time doing X [\u0026hellip;] when people say that optimizing X doesn\u0026rsquo;t help because they don\u0026rsquo;t spend time on X and are not bottlenecked on X, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match my experience as I find I spend plenty of time bottlenecked on X for commonly dismissed Xs. I think that part of this is because getting faster at X can actually increase time spent on X due to a sort of virtuous cycle feedback loop of where it makes sense to spend time. Another part of this is illustrated in this comment by Fabian Giesen:\nIt is commonly accepted, verging on a cliche, that you have no idea where your program spends time until you actually profile it, but the corollary that you also don\u0026rsquo;t know where you spend your time until you\u0026rsquo;ve measured it is not nearly as accepted.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;ve looked how people spend time vs. how people think they spend time, it\u0026rsquo;s wildly inaccurate and I think there\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental reason that, unless they measure, people\u0026rsquo;s estimates of how they spend their time tends to be way off, which is nicely summed in by another Fabian Giesen quote, which happens to be about solving rubik\u0026rsquo;s cubes but applies to other cognitive tasks:\nParaphrasing a well-known cuber, \u0026ldquo;your own pauses never seem bad while you\u0026rsquo;re solving, because your brain is busy and you know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about, but once you have a video it tends to become blindingly obvious what you need to improve\u0026rdquo;. Which is pretty much the usual \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t assume, profile\u0026rdquo; advice for programs, but applied to a situation where you\u0026rsquo;re concentrated and busy for the entire time, whereas the default assumption in programming circles seems to be that as long as you\u0026rsquo;re actually doing work and not distracted or slacking off, you can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be losing a lot of time\nUnlike most people who discuss this topic online, I\u0026rsquo;ve actually looked at where my time goes and a lot of it goes to things that are canonical examples of things that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t waste time improving because people don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time doing them.\nAn example of one of these, the most commonly cited bad-thing-to-optimize example that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, is typing speed (when discussing this, people usually say that typing speed doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because more time is spent thinking than typing). But, when I look at where my time goes, a lot of it is spent typing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI spend roughly halve my writing time typing. If I typed at what some people say median typing speed is (40 WPM) instead of the rate some random typing test clocked me at (110 WPM), this would be a 0.5 + 0.5 * 110/40 = 1.875x slowdown [\u0026hellip;]\nAlso see Randall Munroe | Is It Worth the Time?\nSpeed enables new workflows. Luu points out that improvements in either enable a different way of interacting. You can write up documents on \u0026ldquo;long shot\u0026rdquo; ideas which may not resonate with people. If you can write faster, you can crank out more documents such that you can accept a lower chance for each idea landing.\nI spend time on things that are high ROI, but those things are generally only high ROI because I\u0026rsquo;ve spent time improving my velocity, which reduces the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; in ROI.\nThinking about productivity is bad and you should \u0026ldquo;live life\u0026rdquo; The last major argument I see against working on velocity assigns negative moral weight to the idea of thinking about productivity and working on velocity at all. This kind of comment often assigns positive moral weight to various kinds of leisure, such as spending time with friends and family. I find this argument to be backwards. If someone thinks it\u0026rsquo;s important to spend time with friends and family, an easy way to do that is to be more productive at work and spend less time working.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA related idea, one that Holden Karnofsky has been talking about for a while, is that if you ever want to make a difference in the world in some way, it\u0026rsquo;s useful to work on your skills even in jobs where it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious that being better at the job is useful, because the developed skills will give you more leverage on the world when you switch to something that\u0026rsquo;s more aligned with you want to achieve.\nBibliography References Luu, Dan. n.d. “Some Reasons to Work on Productivity and Velocity.” Accessed October 27, 2023. https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/.

On November 16, Moderna announced (a) that the vaccine\u0026rsquo;s efficacy was 94.5%. Source: linked materials. Note: the BioNTech vaccine was produced on a similarly impressive timeline but I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet tracked down sufficiently granular information about its development\u0026mdash;pointers appreciated. San Francisco proposed a new bus lane (a) on Van Ness in 2001. It opened in 2022 (a), yielding a project duration of around 7,600 days. \u0026ldquo;The project has been delayed due to an increase of wet weather since the project started,\u0026rdquo; said Paul Rose, a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency spokesperson. The project cost $346 million, i.e. $110,000 per meter. The Alaska Highway, mentioned above, constructed across remote tundra, cost $793 per meter in 2019 dollars.\nBibliography References Collison, Patrick. n.d. “Fast.” Accessed October 27, 2023. https://patrickcollison.com/fast.

It\u0026rsquo;s a simple presentation (which I\u0026rsquo;ve further simplified here for clarity): a volunteer chooses a card and seals the card in an envelope. Then, the magician invites the volunteer to choose some tea. There are dozens of boxes of tea, all sealed in plastic. The volunteer chooses one, rips the plastic, and chooses one of the sealed packets containing the tea bags. When the volunteer rips open the packet … inside is their card.\nThe secret is mundane, but to me it\u0026rsquo;s thrilling. The card choice is a force. But choice from those dozens of boxes of tea really is a free choice, and the choice of tea bag within that box is also a free choice. There\u0026rsquo;s no sleight-of-hand: the magician doesn\u0026rsquo;t touch the tea boxes or the teabag that the volunteer chooses. The card really is inside of that sealed tea packet.\nThe trick is all in the preparation. Before the trick, the magician buys dozens of boxes of tea, opens every single one, unwraps each tea packet. Puts a Three of Clubs into each packet. Reseals the packet. Puts the packets back in the box. Re-seals each box. And repeats this hundreds of times. This takes hours — days, even.\nThe only \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; is that this preparation seems so boring, so impossibly tedious, that when we see the effect we can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that anyone would do something so tedious just for this simple effect.\nTeller writes about this in an article about the seven secrets of magic:\nYou will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest. My partner, Penn, and I once produced 500 live cockroaches from a top hat on the desk of talk-show host David Letterman. To prepare this took weeks. We hired an entomologist who provided slow-moving, camera-friendly cockroaches (the kind from under your stove don\u0026rsquo;t hang around for close-ups) and taught us to pick the bugs up without screaming like preadolescent girls. Then we built a secret compartment out of foam-core (one of the few materials cockroaches can\u0026rsquo;t cling to) and worked out a devious routine for sneaking the compartment into the hat. More trouble than the trick was worth? To you, probably. But not to magicians.\nI often have people newer to the tech industry ask me for secrets to success. There aren\u0026rsquo;t many, really, but this secret — being willing to do something so terrifically tedious that it appears to be magic — works in tech too.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re an industry obsessed with automation, with streamlining, with efficiency. One of the foundational texts of our engineering culture, Larry Wall\u0026rsquo;s virtues of the programmer, includes laziness:\nLaziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to answer so many questions about it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t disagree: being able to offload repetitive tasks to a program is one of the best things about knowing how to code. However, sometimes problems can\u0026rsquo;t be solved by automation. If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to embrace the grind you\u0026rsquo;ll look like a magician.\nFor example, I once joined a team maintaining a system that was drowning in bugs. There were something like two thousand open bug reports. Nothing was tagged, categorized, or prioritized. The team couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree on which issues to tackle. They were stuck essentially pulling bugs at random, but it was never clear if that issue was important.. New bug reports couldn\u0026rsquo;t be triaged effectively because finding duplicates was nearly impossible. So the open ticket count continued to climb. The team had been stalled for months. I was tasked with solving the problem: get the team unstuck, get reverse the trend in the open ticket count, come up with a way to eventually drive it down to zero.\nSo I used the same trick as the magician, which is no trick at all: I did the work. I printed out all the issues - one page of paper for each issue. I read each page. I took over a huge room and started making piles on the floor. I wrote tags on sticky notes and stuck them to piles. I shuffled pages from one stack to another. I wrote ticket numbers on whiteboards in long columns; I imagined I was Ben Affleck in The Accountant. I spent almost three weeks in that room, and emerged with every bug report reviewed, tagged, categorized, and prioritized.\nThe trend reversed immediately after that: we were able to close several hundred tickets immediately as duplicates, and triaging new issues now took minutes instead of a day. It took I think a year or more to drive the count to zero, but it was all fairly smooth sailing. People said I did the impossible, but that\u0026rsquo;s wrong: I merely did something so boring that nobody else had been willing to do it.\nSometimes, programming feels like magic: you chant some arcane incantation and a fleet of robots do your bidding. But sometimes, magic is mundane. If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to embrace the grind, you can pull off the impossible.\nBibliography References Kaplan-Moss, Jacob. n.d. “Embrace the Grind.” Accessed October 26, 2023. https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/.

That\u0026rsquo;s all coming from a faulty paradigm: that it\u0026rsquo;s expected for your daughter to tell you the truth when you ask her if she did something wrong.\nAsking her if she did something wrong is setting her up for failure, whether or not you know the answer. I know it is a \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; parents like to do, mine did as well, where we say - as you did - \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not whether you did it or not, but that you tell the truth about it\u0026rdquo; - but now you\u0026rsquo;re the liar, aren\u0026rsquo;t you? Because it darned tooting is about whether she did it or not. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether she did it or not, why are you asking? Some sort of cruel mind game?\nPut it to you this way, you\u0026rsquo;re on trial for stealing a car, and the prosecutor asks you \u0026ldquo;Did you do it?\u0026rdquo; What are you doing in that scenario? I highly doubt it\u0026rsquo;s admitting fault, unless the prosecutor can already prove it and is offering you a deal.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;re donig right now is training her to lie well. Because that\u0026rsquo;s the only winning game theory scenario on her end: lying, and lying effectively. Lying and getting caught = bad. Telling the truth = bad. Only lying and not getting caught wins, so - that\u0026rsquo;s what she\u0026rsquo;s learning to do. And kids are smart. She sees how you\u0026rsquo;ve set up the game, and the only option you\u0026rsquo;re giving her to win.\nTurn the paradigm around, instead. Why are you asking her if she did [something wrong]? Either it\u0026rsquo;s because you know something wrong was done by someone, and you just don\u0026rsquo;t know whom, or because you weren\u0026rsquo;t paying enough attention to know what was done wrong.\n[emphasis mine]\n(Joe 2017)\nRemember that other adults will apply labels to your children\u0026rsquo;s behavior which may not align with your own definitions\ne.g. \u0026ldquo;They were being disrespectful\u0026rdquo; which, to that person, meant \u0026ldquo;They didn\u0026rsquo;t obey me without question\u0026rdquo; e.g. \u0026ldquo;They were out of control\u0026rdquo; which, to that person, meant \u0026ldquo;They were acting like a kid\u0026rdquo; and the person in question doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand/appreciate/empathize with normal (to you at least) behaviors at your child(rens) age e.g. \u0026ldquo;They were rude\u0026rdquo; which, to that person, meant \u0026ldquo;They questioned my authority\u0026rdquo; (which I at least want to encourage in my children) At some point your kid will have to learn the Hard truths\nKids copy, so behave the way you want them to behave\nWant them to enjoy reading?

Like, \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t pick up my laundry when you asked me to because I was eating a donut after you said not to, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come out of the kitchen with donut all over my face or you would know I ate it.\u0026rdquo; This tends to be the least likely option, though, and also tends to be accompanied by guilty looks and/or other evidence of breaking the rules (e.g., fewer donuts in the box).\nIt could also be that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to say \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do what you asked, so I ignored it.\u0026rdquo; (Would you react warmly and cheerfully to that, even as honest as it is? I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t.) Even without a punishment attached, kids don\u0026rsquo;t really want disapproval and disappointment, either.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember what I was thinking when I decided to disregard instructions, or I don\u0026rsquo;t remember being asked to do something.\nIn this case, he could say \u0026ldquo;I forgot what you asked me to do\u0026rdquo; but may be looking for a reason for why he forgot \u0026ndash; and the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; of memory and attention is a complicated question!\nMy ten-year-old with ADHD has absolutely no idea why he has a harder time concentrating on instructions than most people. This frustrates him and frustrates me, so we both work on not looking for the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; in those cases. (This doesn\u0026rsquo;t imply your child has ADHD, neurotypical children also have moments where they\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention. However, they won\u0026rsquo;t have any better idea of why they weren\u0026rsquo;t paying attention.)\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to communicate the complex emotions behind my decision.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m angry about something at work, I\u0026rsquo;m more prone to forget to run an errand on the way home that I need to get done. The distraction of all the other things in my life got in the way of doing what needed to get done.\nBut if somebody asks me why I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy bread from the store, I would be hard pressed to explain the sequence of bad meetings, co-worker rudeness, and random software glitches that led to me being so frazzled. At best, I\u0026rsquo;d be able to say, \u0026ldquo;Ugh, I just had a bad day.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about it.\nThis is a bit more common with older children, especially once you\u0026rsquo;re hitting adolescence, but happens at pretty much any age. If they don\u0026rsquo;t want to discuss what is going on in their head, this keeps that discussion from even starting. And the root cause of that could be any combination of the previous reasons, or wanting privacy, or feeling ashamed of themselves, or just not wanting to talk. (My kids know that any discussion about their motivations will lead to a discussion about making better choices, etc. and that can be boring/exhausting for them\u0026hellip;)\nOr, it\u0026rsquo;s pure honesty: I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do that thing.\nMotivation is a complex subject, and even adults struggle to get to the root cause of choices they make. Sometimes people make bad choices, and children are still developing both impulse control and introspection.\n(Acire 2018)\nOnly Asking Real Questions (a) On religion (“Should I Allow or Forbid My Son to Visit the Education of a Religion That I Do Not Share?” 2020) \u0026ldquo;focus on understanding the reasons for belief, and the benefits of believing in something even if it\u0026rsquo;s not real.\u0026rdquo; (Joe 2019) On raising your kids different than the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;re vegan, so that\u0026rsquo;ll be one mark against normal right off the bat\nOddness goes both ways\nI think there are two problems here:\nYour child is friends with a kid who has learned some maladaptive behaviors/ideas and is passing them on to your child.\nYou and your wife are apparently unaware of the social and cultural realities outside your own family.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that you can fix the situation, but you\u0026rsquo;d have a better chance of doing so if you understand the situation. I say this as someone who spent nearly a decade working with \u0026ldquo;at risk\u0026rdquo; kids.\nFirst of all, your family is not \u0026ldquo;pretty typical\u0026rdquo; outside your neighborhood. 38% of US households have at least one firearm (a). 98.9% of US households have television sets (a). More than 2/3 of kids have video game systems at home, and 92% of children and adolescents ages 2-17 play video games (a) (pdf). 61.5% of children aged 9\u0026ndash;13 years do not participate in any organized physical activity during their nonschool hours and that 22.6% do not engage in any free-time physical activity (a). I don\u0026rsquo;t have stats on profanity usage, but asking around to a couple of teachers I know from middle-class neighborhoods, their 1st-3rd graders frequently require discipline for using profanity that is considered \u0026ldquo;okay\u0026rdquo; at home. I could go on and on.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying that your family\u0026rsquo;s values are wrong, just that they are not typical. Most people walk around with the illusion that their values are the norm, simply because we tend to surround ourselves with people who share our values. You need to be aware of this because you seem not to recognize how foreign and hard to navigate your family\u0026rsquo;s social scripts and values are to this kid.\nImagine that you were 8 years old, and dropped on some remote island. Everyone there spoke English and their houses looked about the same as yours, but their behavior was absolutely confounding. These people gave wet willies as greetings, never ever used words like \u0026ldquo;hey\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo; (and were terribly offended if you did) and thought you were potentially criminally violent because of your firm handshake (which in your culture is a sign of confidence and strength). That\u0026rsquo;s essentially what this kid feels like coming to your house \u0026ndash; your social rules are so different from the ones he was taught at home, even if he were 100% motivated to adapt it would take time and many mistakes. How easy would it be for the islanders to convince 8yo you that \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; is a horribly offensive cuss word, and handshakes are threatening?\n[bold emphasis mine]\n(HedgeMage 2011)\nYou\u0026rsquo;re going to raise your kids in a way that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;odd\u0026rdquo; to some other parents and some of the friends your kid makes and wants to play with and have over to your house On diapers Cloth diapers Re-usable! They don\u0026rsquo;t go in a landfill! They may have a greater environmental impact than disposable diapers depending on how you\u0026rsquo;ll wash and treat them On when it\u0026rsquo;s hard This too shall pass On independence Be aware that others in the community, as well as government organizations, may push back at your idea of a safe level of independence https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345598 (a) On discipline Have a reason behind the punishment and ensure the reason actually aligns with the punishment\nNo yelling, shouting, raised voices\nNo corporal/striking/hitting punishments (e.g. spanking)\nReward desirable behavior with attention; or punish by ignoring\nConsider time-outs as a cool/calm-down period rather than as a punishment\nConsider saying that there will be a punishment, then taking time to consider what it will be (don\u0026rsquo;t decide in the heat of the moment)\nOne thing I think my parents did right was never telling me in the heat of the moment how I would be punished. I knew how I was supposed to behave, and they let me know when I was not living up to the standard, but if they decided to punish me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t find out right away what my punishment would be. The only exception was trivial punishments like being sent to my room or having something taken away for a few hours, or if the behavior problem was ongoing and they had time away from me to talk between themselves and decide what would be appropriate to threaten me with.\nThis accomplished two things. First, they never had to back down on a punishment, because they were careful to only threaten me with things they could stand behind. That meant I never felt any urge to misbehave to call their bluff. Proving parents wrong is irresistible to kids, so if you threaten a punishment you can\u0026rsquo;t follow through on, you\u0026rsquo;ve just given them a reason to do the thing you\u0026rsquo;re told them not to. Even if you punish them in another way, it\u0026rsquo;s worth it just to prove you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do what you said.\nSecond, it forced me to actively imagine what an appropriate punishment would be. To get into their heads and imagine how they would punish me, I had to think about why my behavior was wrong from their point of view. Kids spend a lot of time arguing against their parents, in their heads as well as out loud, and I think many kids don\u0026rsquo;t have enough occasion to go through the opposite process of thinking with their parents to try to predict their behavior.\n(dkarl n.d.)\nOn limiting or banning behaviors or activities Attempt to redirect rather than outright ban something\nWhen I was around your son\u0026rsquo;s age, my mother was worried I was playing too many video games. Her strategy was to get me involved in other after-school activities, like theater, which I ended up loving.\nAs long as this is your child\u0026rsquo;s only peer group, and that is their only activity, the game will be irresistible. He\u0026rsquo;ll need something else to fill the gap \u0026ndash;music, or sports, or art \u0026ndash;and other kids to be around, whose parents have made similar decisions as you have. The peer group is EVERYTHING at this age. (You also could probably benefit from the moral support of a group of like-minded parents.)\nIf he does develop other interests, it\u0026rsquo;s possible you might eventually be able to relax the rules without him going crazy. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, even though my mother never actually forbade video games for me, I just never got as deeply into them as my peers, because I had so many other things I was interested in. I won\u0026rsquo;t claim I never went through the occasional video game binge, but it never lasted. I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing a similar strategy with my own kids (a little younger than yours) and it seems to be working out so far.\n(Sunami 2018b)\nConsider the community you and your child(ren) exist within; you may need to change the System in order to change the behavior\nGiven the smallness of your community, and the tight-knit nature of your son\u0026rsquo;s peer group, this is not a problem you will be able to solve on your own. You need to reach out to the parents of the other boys to express your concerns, even if you suspect they will not be receptive. It will be important not to come across as chastising or judging them, but just as looking for support and advice.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn turn, you might agree to let your son do some gaming with his friends, as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing he does with them. In my experience, what\u0026rsquo;s most harmful isn\u0026rsquo;t the obsessive activity itself, it\u0026rsquo;s the way it crowds everything else out. Something like a once-a-week \u0026ldquo;tech sabbath\u0026rdquo; (for instance, no computers, games or phones on Sundays) can really help. It could be something the family could do together, or that you could perhaps even convince some of his friends to sign on for. (I personally do a tech sabbath myself \u0026ndash;as a professional programmer it\u0026rsquo;s vital to have at least one day a week I\u0026rsquo;m not staring at screens.)\n(Sunami 2018a)\nMedia, books, etc Books Welcome To The Museum book series Curiositree series National geographic kids Calvin and Hobbes Media (good) Bluey (a) Tumble leaf (a) Little bear (a) Eleanor Wonders Why Sarah and Duck Mister Rogers Puffin rock (a) Planet Earth and other nature documentaries, etc PBS Kids The World of Peter Rabbit and friends Trashtruck Magic school bus (old version) Avoid, bad Paw patrol Teaching To read Read what you love until you love to read (TracingWoodgrains 2018) and comments (Engelman, Haddox, and Bruner 5AD) Supplemental material: (“Videos \u0026amp; Supplemental Material | Teach Your Child To Read In 100 Easy Lessons!” n.d.)

(a) Biology I should have loved biology (a) Meta Instill that learning is different than school\nAs Ivan Illich wrote in Deschooling Society (a): \u0026ldquo;The pupil is thereby \u0026lsquo;schooled\u0026rsquo; to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new.\u0026rdquo;\n(Perell n.d.)\nInstill that a particular lesson, test, etc, isn\u0026rsquo;t the end-all-be-all decider of their future\nEngage the learner in setting the curriculum\nFirst, we ignore their cries for agency. Then, we squash their curiosity with rigid curriculums like AERO and the Common Core that move too slow for the bored and too fast for the curious. Worse, the tyrannical curriculum structure teaches children to accept the world as it exists. Students can\u0026rsquo;t modify the syllabus. They have to accept it as it\u0026rsquo;s given to them. By doing so, we kill the joy of learning, strip agency away from our children, and in turn, rob them of their humanity.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve stopped treating children like people.\n(Perell n.d.)\nHome schooling Difficult to do right; easy to do poorly\nConsider supplemental home schooling (e.g. extra math, reading, art, etc) in conjunction with traditional school\nhttps://responsiblehomeschooling.org/ (a)\n(C-Dreym 2023)\nThere are so many things to consider that I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to write down all of them, but make sure if you homeschool that you are forcing yourself to be held accountable. Parents go in with the best of intentions, but then get behind and are told by other homeschool parents that it\u0026rsquo;s normal and not to worry. A certain amount of flexibility is fine, but your kid getting too far behind does become an issue and is something you need to address sooner than later. Something like online school would at least hold you accountable better.\nAlso you need to be held accountable against abuse and your kid needs to have a number of safe adults they can confide in that won\u0026rsquo;t protect you. Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s easy to say you\u0026rsquo;re just not going to abuse your kid, and definitely don\u0026rsquo;t do that, but my parents didn\u0026rsquo;t think they were abusing me. After going through abuse while being isolated, I absolutely refuse to put my kid in an unprotected situation even from myself. Your kid is also most likely to face abuse from someone close to them. If you\u0026rsquo;ve made it clear who they can go to for concerns about anyone, even you, it helps prevent abuse from other close adults going unreported or getting dismissed. Regular doctor appointments are important too, both for health reasons and for accountability.\nHave a lot of humility. You\u0026rsquo;re your child\u0026rsquo;s parent, your going to be too close to always see everything that\u0026rsquo;s going on. Take feedback from other people, especially those who have a background to know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about. My mom was convinced that I only struggled in math because of ADHD and carelessness, turns out I have a math learning disability that went undiagnosed my entire childhood. On the other hand, I got a lot farther in my math education than most people with math learning disabilities because of one on one teaching and higher expectations.\nDo your own homework on current educational best practices. For example, teach phonetics. Not being taught to read phonetically is something that\u0026rsquo;s still difficult for me. Don\u0026rsquo;t just use the highly advertised Christian homeschool curriculum. Don\u0026rsquo;t just search your local homeschool Facebook group and go with whatever they are recommending or giving away for free. I got taught really outdated things that way. The average Joe is not qualified to make curriculum recommendations. This isn\u0026rsquo;t even a job public school teachers have. Follow expert advice. This is another reason online school can be a better option.\nGet your kid involved with public school kids in non religious settings. Maybe even get them involved in public school activities. Depending on the state there is a lot in public schools available to homeschoolers. Socialization is extremely important, do not listen to anyone telling you it\u0026rsquo;s not, socialization with their peers especially. I was always told it wasn\u0026rsquo;t important because I would be interacting with only adults eventually anyways. Well those peers grew up to be different sorts of adults than our parents, so that didn\u0026rsquo;t work out well for me at all. I also missed out on a lot of common experiences my peers had, which makes me feel like an outsider.\nGive your child a choice to go to public school, and don\u0026rsquo;t lie to them about, or embellish, what it\u0026rsquo;s like there. Lots of homeschoolers chose to remain homeschooled because we were afraid of public school when it would have been better for us. Also counter the lies of other people about public school. Homeschooling is pushed really strongly by homeschoolers, and that can make conversations about what\u0026rsquo;s really best for the kid difficult. Also different schools can be very different experiences for different kids.\nI get that school shootings are concerning, but as a former homeschooler I\u0026rsquo;m going to be putting my kid into public school and keeping them there unless they really aren\u0026rsquo;t doing well and want to try something else. I find homeschooling to be unnecessarily risky in America. I would also look at going through a public school program if I were to ever homeschool/online school. Parents don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing better than the teachers that have an education in it, even if some teachers are awful. I originally went to college for education before switching majors, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to it. My mom was a public school special education teacher before homeschooling us, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot to expect yourself to do the job of an entire school, and you\u0026rsquo;re not an expert. I think homeschooling could be better, but it\u0026rsquo;s not set up that way currently and I can\u0026rsquo;t in good conscience recommend it as a better option, just better ways to go about it.\nConsider the political angle of those introducing policies which drive parents to home school their kids: Women will bear the brunt of the schooling labor and will, statistically, drop out of the workforce at a higher rate. This may be a desirable secondary effect; weakening women\u0026rsquo;s political power and enforcing a \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; family structure with the mother at home.\nAsk HN: If you\u0026rsquo;ve considered homeschooling, what\u0026rsquo;s stopping you?

It has been defined as \u0026ldquo;the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing\u0026rdquo;. [\u0026hellip;]\nThere is no single agreed upon definition of sensemaking, but there is consensus that it is a process that allows people to understand ambiguous, equivocal or confusing issues or events.\n(“Sensemaking” 2023)\n[\u0026hellip;] We define sensemaking as the deliberate effort to understand events. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSensemaking begins when someone experiences a surprise or perceives an inadequacy in the existing frame and the existing perception of relevant data.\n(Klein et al. n.d.)\nProperties Weick identified seven properties of sensemaking (Weick 2010)\nIdentity \u0026mdash; who people think they are in their context shapes what they enact and how they interpret events Retrospection provides the opportunity for sensemaking: the point of retrospection in time affects what people notice, thus attention and interruptions to that attention are highly relevant to the process People enact the environments they face in dialogues and narratives. As people speak, and build narrative accounts, it helps them understand what they think, organize their experiences and control and predict events [Writing to think, releted?] Sensemaking is a social activity in that plausible stories are preserved, retained or shared (Isabella, 1990; Maitlis, 2005). However, the audience for sensemaking includes the speakers themselves and the narratives are \u0026ldquo;both individual and shared\u0026hellip;an evolving product of conversations with ourselves and with others\u0026rdquo; Sensemaking is ongoing, so Individuals simultaneously shape and react to the environments they face. As they project themselves onto this environment and observe the consequences they learn about their identities and the accuracy of their accounts of the world. This is a feedback process so even as individuals deduce their identity from the behaviour of others towards them, they also try to influence this behaviour. As Weick argued, \u0026ldquo;The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs\u0026rdquo;. People extract cues from the context to help them decide on what information is relevant and what explanations are acceptable. Extracted cues provide points of reference for linking ideas to broader networks of meaning and are \u0026lsquo;simple, familiar structures that are seeds from which people develop a larger sense of what may be occurring.\u0026quot;. People favour plausibility over accuracy in accounts of events and contexts: \u0026ldquo;in an equivocal, postmodern world, infused with the politics of interpretation and conflicting interests and inhabited by people with multiple shifting identities, an obsession with accuracy seems fruitless, and not of much practical help, either\u0026rdquo;.

Cognitive learning is not simply a matter of adding additional beliefs into the existing mental models. Rather, we have to revise our belief systems and our mental models as experience shows the inadequacy of our current ways of thinking. [\u0026hellip;]\nCognitive transformation theory is the idea that \u0026ldquo;progress in cognitive skills depends on successively shedding outmoded sets of beliefs and adopting new beliefs.\u0026rdquo; The authors propose it in contrast to the \u0026ldquo;storehouse\u0026rdquo; model in which a learner improves by acquiring new knowledge in an additive process (more new knowledge, better decisions/answers/etc) which is incorrect. \u0026ldquo;Our central claim is that conceptual learning is discontinuous rather than smooth. We make periodic advances when we replace flawed mental models with better ones. However, during the process of cognitive development our mental models get harder to disconfirm. As we move up the learning curve or have more expertise, we have to put more energy into unlearning \u0026mdash; discomfirming mental models \u0026mdash; in order to accept better ones.\u0026rdquo;\nThe authors distinguish between forms of knowledge which have different effective learning models:\nForm Effective learning model Declarative Storehouse Routines and procedures Storehouse Recognition of familiar patterns Cognitive transformation theory Perceptual discrimination skills Cognitive transformation theory Mental models Cognitive transformation theory The later three forms correspond to expertise.\nSo how do you learn, anyway? The authors \u0026ldquo;treat cognitive learning as Sensemaking\u0026rdquo; with four components:\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing the reasons for weak performance depends on sensemaking. The instructor, whether in person or virtual, has to ferret out the reasons why the student is confused and making errors. Sometimes trainees do not even notice errors or weaknesses and may resist suggestions to overcome problems they do not realize they have. Even if trainees do realize something is wrong, the cause/effect mechanisms are subtle and complex. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe goal of diagnosis goes beyond establishing learning objectives—it depends on discovering what flaw in a mental model needs to be corrected.\nFor cognitive skills, it is very difficult to determine and define the existing problem. Cognitive Task Analysis [Cognitive task analysis] methods may be needed to diagnose subtle aspects of cognitive skills.\nLearning objectives\n[\u0026hellip;] novices may not have mental models for an unfamiliar domain and will struggle to formulate even rudimentary mental models linking causes to effects. Their learning objective is to employ sensemaking to generate initial mental models cause/effect stories, whereas experts are revising and adding to current mental models.\nPractice\nProviding students with practice is necessary for gaining proficiency. But with cognitive skills, practice is not sufficient. For cognitive skills, trainees often may not know what they should be watching and monitoring. They need adequate mental models to direct their attention, but until they get smarter, they may fail to spot the cues that will help them develop better mental models.\nFeedback\nProviding students with feedback will not be useful if they do not understand it. For complex cognitive skills, such as leadership, time lags between actions and consequences will create difficulties in sorting out what worked, what did not work, and why. Learners need to engage in sensemaking to discover cause-effect relationships between actions taken at time one and the effects seen at time two. To make things more complicated, learners often have to account for other actions and events that are interspersed between their actions and the consequences, They have to figure out what really caused the consequences versus the coincidental events that had nothing to do with their actions. They have to understand the causes versus the symptoms of deeper causes, and they have to sort out what just happened, the factors in play, the influence of these factors, and the time lags for the effects.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTo add to these complications, having an instructor or training tool provide feedback can actually get in the way of transfer of learning (Schmidt \u0026amp; Wulf, 1997) even though it increases the learning curve during acquisition. By placing Students in an environment where they are given rapid feedback, the students are not compelled to develop skills for seeking their own feedback. Further, students may become distracted from intrinsic feedback because it is so much easier to rely on the extrinsic feedback. As a result, when they complete what they set out to learn, they are not prepared to seek and interpret their own feedback.\nSo how do you un-learn, anyway? One un-learns by replacing lower-fidelity mental models with more sophisticated ones. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not an easy process as \u0026ldquo;people may be reluctant to abandon inadequate mental models, as they may not appreciate the inadequacies. They may attempt to explain away the inconsistencies and anomalies\u0026rdquo;. People are more eager to cling to their current mental models than they are to replace them with new ones.\nAs for how you could get students to do this: you don\u0026rsquo;t; they do. That is, the process must come from within once the learner \u0026ldquo;accept[s] the data and revis[es] the theory/model\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] students will be more likely to abandon a flawed set of beliefs if they have an alternative theory/model available. This method may work best when the alternative model is already part of the students\u0026rsquo; repertoire\u0026rdquo;.\nEssentially: Encourage the student to doubt their mental model by inducing Cognitive dissonance (e.g. \u0026ldquo;asking students to justify their models\u0026rdquo; in the face of new evidence so they themselves notice the inconsistencies as they attempt to build an argument). You don\u0026rsquo;t change their mental models \u0026mdash; they choose to change their own.\nThoughts Notes Abstract The traditional approach to learning is to define the objectives (the gap between the knowledge a person has and the knowledge the person needs to perform the task), establish the regimen for practice, and provide feedback. Learning procedures and factual data is seen as adding more information and skills to the person\u0026rsquo;s storehouse of knowledge. However, this storehouse metaphor is poorly suited for cognitive skill, and does not address the differing learning needs of novices and experts. Teaching cognitive skills requires the diagnosis of the problem in terms of flaws in existing mental models, not gaps in knowledge. It requires learning objectives that are linked to the person\u0026rsquo;s current mental models. It requires practice regimens that may have to result in \u0026ldquo;unlearning\u0026rdquo; that enables the person to abandon the current, flawed mental models. It requires feedback that promotes sensemaking [Sensemaking]. We propose a Cognitive Transformation Theory to guide the development of cognitive skills. Finally, we present several strategies that might be useful in overcoming barriers to understanding and to revising mental models. Finally, we show the implications of Cognitive Transformation Theory for using virtual environments (VEs; where a \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; student interacts with a \u0026ldquo;simulated\u0026rdquo; environment) in training.\nIntroduction How can cognitive skills be improved? The conventional mechanisms of practice, feedback, and accumulation of knowledge rarely apply to cognitive skills in the same way they apply to behavioral skills. In this chapter we argue that cognitive learning requires a different concept of the learning process.\nTraditional approaches to learning seem clear-cut:\nidentify what you want the student to learn provide the knowledge and present an opportunity to practice the skill or concept give feedback so the student can gauge whether the learning has succeeded. Educating students in behavioral skills appears to simply be a matter of practice and feedback This approach to learning relies on a storehouse metaphor. It assumes the learner is missing some critical form of konwledge \u0026mdash; factual information or procedures. [\u0026hellip;]\nWe believe that this storehouse metaphor is insufficient to describe learning of cognitive skills. [\u0026hellip;] We can distinguish different forms of knowledge that people need in order to gain expertise:\ndeclarative knowledge routines and procedures recognition of familiar patterns perceptual discrimination skills mental models The storehouse metaphor seems best suited for acquiring declarative knowledge and for learning new routines/procedures. It may be less apt for building pattern-recognition skills. It is least appropriate for teaching people to make perceptual discriminations and for improving the quality of their mental models.\nWhen people build a larger repertoire of patterns and prototypes, they are not simply adding new items to their lists. They are learning how to categorize the new items and are changing categories and redefining the patterns and prototypes as they gain new experience. The storehouse metaphor implies a simple additive process, which would lead to confusion rather than to growth. [\u0026hellip;]\nWhen people develop perceptual discrimination skills [\u0026hellip;] they are learning to make distinctions that they did previously did not notice. They are learning to \u0026ldquo;see the invisible\u0026rdquo; [Gary A. Klein and Robert R. Hoffman | Seeing the Invisible: Perceptual-cognitive Aspects of Expertise] in the sense that they can now make discriminations they previously did not notice. [\u0026hellip;]\nCognitive skills depend heavily on mental models [Mental model]. We define a mental model as a cluster of causal beliefs about how things happen. [\u0026hellip;]\nCognitive learning is not simply a matter of adding additional beliefs into the existing mental models. Rather, we have to revise our belief systems and our mental models as experience shows the inadequacy of our current ways of thinking. [\u0026hellip;]\n[formatting mine]\nSensemaking requirements for learning cognitive skills We treat cognitive learning as a sensemaking [Sensemaking] activity that includes four components:\nDiagnosis Diagnosing the reasons for weak performance depends on sensemaking. The instructor, whether in person or virtual, has to ferret out the reasons why the student is confused and making errors. Sometimes trainees do not even notice errors or weaknesses and may resist suggestions to overcome problems they do not realize they have. Even if trainees do realize something is wrong, the cause/effect mechanisms are subtle and complex. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe goal of diagnosis goes beyond establishing learning objectives—it depends on discovering what flaw in a mental model needs to be corrected.\nFor cognitive skills, it is very difficult to determine and define the existing problem. Cognitive Task Analysis [Cognitive task analysis] methods may be needed to diagnose subtle aspects of cognitive skills.\nLearning objectives [\u0026hellip;] for cognitive learning, the objectives may be to help the students revise their mental models and perhaps to reorganize the way they categorize events. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWe further assert that novices may not have mental models for an unfamiliar domain and will struggle to formulate even rudimentary mental models linking causes to effects. Their learning objective is to employ sensemaking to generate initial mental models cause/effect stories, whereas experts are revising and adding to current mental models.\nPractice Providing students with practice is necessary for gaining proficiency. But with cognitive skills, practice is not sufficient. For cognitive skills, trainees often may not know what they should be watching and monitoring. They need adequate mental models to direct their attention, but until they get smarter, they may fail to spot the cues that will help them develop better mental models.\n[Virtual environments] [(simulations)] can help trainees gain this needed practice in a context that allows them to build more robust mental models. [\u0026hellip;] VE training [\u0026hellip;] surpassed real world training [with sufficient exposure to virtual training environments].\nManaging attention depends on sensemaking. Feedback will not be useful if the trainee does not notice or understand it \u0026mdash; and that requires the trainee to know what to attend to and when to shift attention. Barrett, Tugade, and Engle (2004) have suggested that attention management accounts for many of the individual differences in working memory \u0026mdash; the ability to focus attention and not be distracted by irrelevancies. For these reasons, we argue that effective practice, whether in actual or in virtual environments, depends on attention management: seeking information \u0026mdash; knowing what to seek and when to seek it \u0026mdash; and filtering distracting data.\nFeedback Providing students with feedback will not be useful if they do not understand it. For complex cognitive skills, such as leadership, time lags between actions and consequences will create difficulties in sorting out what worked, what did not work, and why. Learners need to engage in sensemaking to discover cause-effect relationships between actions taken at time one and the effects seen at time two. To make things more complicated, learners often have to account for other actions and events that are interspersed between their actions and the consequences, They have to figure out what really caused the consequences versus the coincidental events that had nothing to do with their actions. They have to understand the causes versus the symptoms of deeper causes, and they have to sort out what just happened, the factors in play, the influence of these factors, and the time lags for the effects.\nAlso see Proximate cause/Ultimate cause and Kind/Wicked environments.\nTo add to these complications, having an instructor or training tool provide feedback can actually get in the way of transfer of learning (Schmidt \u0026amp; Wulf, 1997) even though it increases the learning curve during acquisition. By placing Students in an environment where they are given rapid feedback, the students are not compelled to develop skills for seeking their own feedback. Further, students may become distracted from intrinsic feedback because it is so much easier to rely on the extrinsic feedback. As a result, when they complete what they set out to learn, they are not prepared to seek and interpret their own feedback.\nOne of the challenges for cognitive learning is to handle time lags between actions and consequences. VE sessions will compress these time lags, which might clarify relationships but will also reduce the opportunity to learn how to interpret delayed feedback. To compensate, VE sessions could add distracters that might have potentially caused the effects as a way to sustain confusion about how to interpret feedback. In addition, VE sessions could be structured to monitor how people interpret the feedback.\nFor cognitive learning, one of the complications facing instructional designers is that the flawed mental models of the students act as a barrier to learning. Students need to have better mental models in order to understand the feedback that would invalidate their existing mental models. Without a good mental model, students will have trouble making \u0026lsquo;use of feedback, but without useful feedback, students will not be able to develop good mental models. That is why cognitive learning may depend on unlearning as well as learning.\nThe process of unlearning You must unlearn what you have learned\nFor people to develop better mental models they may have to unlearn some of their existing mental models. The reason is that as people gain experience, their understanding of a domain should become more complex and nuanced. The mental models that provided a rough approximation need to be replaced by more sophisticated ones. But people may be reluctant to abandon inadequate mental models, as they may not appreciate the inadequacies. They may attempt to explain away the inconsistencies and anomalies.\nChinn and Brewer (1993) showed that scientists and science students alike deflected inconvenient data. They identified seven reactions to anomalous data that were inconsistent with a mental model:\nignoring the data rejecting the data finding a way to exclude the data from an evaluation of the theory/model holding the data in abeyance reinterpreting the data while retaining the theory/model reinterpreting the data and making peripheral changes to the theory/model accepting the data and revising the theory/model Only this last reaction changes the core beliefs. The others involve ways to discount the data and preserve the theory.\n[\u0026hellip;] Sensemaking here is a deliberate activity to discover what is wrong with one\u0026rsquo;s mental models and to abandon and replace them.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Organizations\u0026rsquo; resistance to dramatic reorientations creates a need for explicit unlearning \u0026hellip; Before attempting radical changes, [organizations] must dismantle parts of their current ideological and political structures. Before they will contemplate dramatically different procedures, policies, and strategies, they must lose confidence in their current procedures, policies, strategies, and top managers\u0026rdquo; (p. 339). We believe that these observations apply to individuals as well as to organizations and that the concept of unlearning needs to become part of a cognitive learning regimen.\nJust like organizations, individuals also resist changing their mental models. Chinn and Brewer (1993) refer to Kuhn\u0026rsquo;s (1962) research to suggest that students will be more likely to abandon a flawed set of beliefs if they have an alternative theory/model available. This method may work best when the alternative model is already part of the students\u0026rsquo; repertoire. [\u0026hellip;]\nHowever, in some situations we suspect that the reverse has to happen. People have to lose confidence in their models before they will seriously consider an alternate. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nScott, Asoko, and Driver (1991) have described two broad types of strategies for producing conceptual change: creating cognitive conflict and building on existing ideas as analogies. The DiBello and Schmitt approaches fit within the first grouping, to create cognitive conflict. The Brown and Clement work exemplifies the second—introducing analogs as platforms for new ideas.\nChinn and Brewer (1993) have also suggested that asking students to justify their models will facilitate their readiness to change models in the face of anomalous data.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nPeople have to diagnose their performance problems, manage their attention, appreciate the implications of feedback, and formulate better mental models by uniearning inadequate models. Learners are not simply accumulating more knowledge into a storehouse. They are changing their perspectives on the world.\n[formatting mine]\nCognitive transformation theory Cognitive transformation theory is the idea that \u0026ldquo;progress in cognitive skills depends on successively shedding outmoded sets of beliefs and adopting new beliefs.\u0026rdquo;\nOur central claim is that conceptual learning is discontinuous rather than smooth. We make periodic advances when we replace flawed mental models with better ones. However, during the process of cognitive development our mental models get harder to disconfirm. As we move up the learning curve or have more expertise, we have to put more energy into unlearning \u0026mdash; discomfirming mental models \u0026mdash; in order to accept better ones.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWe can represent cognitive transformation theory as a set of postulates:\nMental models are central to cognitive learning\nInstruction needs to diagnose limitations in mental models, design interventions to help students appreciate the flaws in their mental models, and provide experiences to enable trainees to discover more useful and accurate mental models.\nMental models are modular\nPeople have a variety of fragmentary mental models, and they weave those together to account for a novel observation. People are usually not matching events to sophisticated theories they have in memory. They are using fragments and partial beliefs to construct relevant mental models. For most domains, the central mental models describe causal relationships. They describe how events transform into later events. Causal mental models typically take the form of a story.\nExperts have more sophisticated mental models in their domains of practice than novices\nExperts have more of the fragmentary beliefs needed to construct a plausible mental model. Therefore, they are starting their construction from a more advanced position. Finally, experts have more accurate causal mental models and have tested and abandoned more inadequate beliefs.\nExperts build their repertoires of fragmentary mental models in a discontinuous fashion\nIn using their mental models, even experts may distort data, oversimplify, explain away diagnostic information, and misunderstand events. At some point, experts realize the inadequacies of their mental models. They abandon their existing mental models and replace these with a better set of causal beliefs. And the cycle begins again.\nLearning curves are usually smooth because researchers combine data from several subjects\nThe reason for the smoothness is the averaging of discontinuous curves.\nExperts are fallible\nNo set of mental models is entirely accurate and complete.\nKnowledge shields [Knowledge shields] are the set of arguments learners can use to explain away data that challenge their mental models\nKnowledge shields pose a barrier to developing cognitive skills. People are skilled at holding onto cherished beliefs. The better the mental models, the easier it is to find flaws in disconfirming evidence and anomalous observations. The S-shaped learning curve reflects the increasing difficulty of replacing mental models as people\u0026rsquo;s mental models become more accurate.\nKnowledge shields affect diagnosis\nActive learners try to overcome their limitations, but they need to understand what those limitations are. Knowledge shields based on poor mental models can lead learners to the wrong diagnoses of their poor performance.\nKnowledge shields affect feedback\nIn building mental models about complex situations, people receive a lot of feedback. However, the knowledge shields enable people to discard or neutralize contradictory data.\nProgress depends on unlearning\nThe better the causal models, the more difficult it is to discover their weaknesses and replace them. In many cases, learners have to encounter a baffling event, an unmistakable anomaly, or an intelligent failure in order to begin doubting their mental models. They have to lose faith in their existing mental models before they can review the pattern of evidence and formulate a better mental model. People can improve their mental models by continually elaborating them, by replacing them with better ones, and/or by unlearning their current mental models. Cognitive development relies on all three processes.\nIndividual differences in attitudes toward cognitive conflict will affect success in conceptual change\nDreyfus, Jungwirth, and Eliovitch (1990) noted that bright and successful students responded positively to anomalies, whereas unsuccessful students tended to avoid the conflicts.\n[emphasis and formatting mine]\nImplications for virtual environments [\u0026hellip;] virtual environments allow for both intrinsic and extrinsic feedback. Many simulations offer scoring or an after action review capability that allows learners to see how they did in comparison to other students or some set standard. More important than the extrinsic feedback, these virtual environments give learners the ability to see how their actions play out and the challenges they may run into based on their mental models, allowing for self-assessment, adjustment, and improvement in cognitive learning.\nBecause cognitive learning depends heavily on sensemaking [Sensemaking], and sensemaking is often complicated by knowledge shields, virtual environment sessions might benefit from designs using garden path [Garden path] scenarios that elicit knowledge shields and give learners a chance to recover from mistaken mindsets and get off the garden path. In a garden path scenario a parson is lead to accept a proposition that seems obviously true and is then given increasing amounts of contrary evidence gradually leading to the realization that the initial proposition is wrong. The paradigm lets us study how long it takes for participants to doubt and then reject the initial proposition \u0026mdash; how long they stay on the garden path.\nBibliography References Klein, Gary, and Holly C.

We define sensemaking as the deliberate effort to understand events. It is typically triggered by unexpected changes or other surprises that make us doubt our prior understanding. We also describe how these sensemaking activities can result in a faulty account of events. Our description incorporates several different aspects of sensemaking:\nThe initial account people generate to explain events. The elaboration of that account. The questioning of that account in response to inconsistent data. Fixation on the initial account. Discovering inadequacies in the initial account. Comparison of alternative accounts. Reframing the initial account and replacing it with another. The deliberate construction of an account when none is automatically recognized. [\u0026hellip; See Examples 1 and 2 below]\nAs these examples show, sensemaking goes well beyond the comprehension of stimuli. The examples also show that sensemaking can be used for different functions.\nproblem detection \u0026mdash; to determine if the pattern was worth worrying about and monitoring more closely connecting the dots and making discoveries forming explanations, as when a physician diagnoses an illness or a mechanic figures out how a device works anticipatory thinking, to prevent potential accidents project future states in order to prepare for them find the levers \u0026mdash; to figure out how to think and act in a situation, as when a project team tries to decide what type of projector to purchase and realizes that the decision is basically a trade-off between cost, size, and functionality see relationships, as when we use a map to understand where we are located problem identification, as when a physics student tries to find a means of depicting the variables in a homework problem in order to find a solution strategy. Research into sensemaking should reflect these and other functions in order to provide a more comprehensive account.\n[formatting mine]\nData-frame theory of sensemaking The data–frame theory postulates that elements are explained when they are fitted into a structure that links them to other elements. We use the term frame to denote an explanatory structure that defines entities by describing their relationship to other entities. A frame can take the form of a story, explaining the chronology of events and the causal relationships between them; a map, explaining where we are by showing distances and directions to various landmarks and showing routes to destinations; a script, explaining our role or job as complementary to the roles or jobs of others; or a plan for describing a sequence of intended actions. Thus, a frame is a structure for accounting for the data and guiding the search for more data. It reflects a person\u0026rsquo;s compiled experiences.\nPeople explore their environment by attending to a small portion of the available information. The data identify the relevant frame, and the frame determines which data are noticed. Neither of these comes first. The data elicit and help to construct the frame; the frame defines, connects, and filters the data. \u0026ldquo;The frame may be in error, but until feedback or some other form of information makes the error evident, the frame is the foundation for understanding the situation and for deciding what to do about it\u0026rdquo; (Beach, 1997, p. 24).\nSensemaking begins when someone experiences a surprise or perceives an inadequacy in the existing frame and the existing perception of relevant data. The active exploration proceeds in both directions, to improve or replace the frame and to obtain more relevant data. The active exploration of an environment, conducted for a purpose, reminds us that sensemaking is an active process and not the passive receipt and combination of messages.\nThe data–frame relationship is analogous to a hidden-figures task. People have trouble identifying the hidden figure until it is pointed out to them, and then they can\u0026rsquo;t not see it. Once the frame becomes clear, so do the data.\nAssertions of the data-frame theory of sensemaking Sensemaking is the process of fitting data into a frame and fitting a frame around the data We distinguish between two entities: data and frames. Data are the interpreted signals of events; frames are the explanatory structures that account for the data. People react to data elements by trying to find or construct a story, script, a map, or some other type of structure to account for the data. At the same time, their repertoire of frames \u0026mdash; explanatory structures \u0026mdash; affects which data elements they consider and how they will interpret these data. We see sensemaking as the effort to balance these two entities \u0026mdash; data and frames. If people notice data that do not fit into the frames they\u0026rsquo;ve been using, the surprise will often initiate sensemaking to modify the frame or replace it with a better one. Another reaction would be to use the frame to search for new data or to reclassify existing data, which in turn could result in a discovery of a better frame.\nThe \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; are inferred, using the frame, rather than being perceptual primitives Data elements are not perfect representations of the world but are constructed \u0026mdash; the way we construct memories rather than remembering all of the events that took place. Different people viewing the same events can perceive and recall different things depending on their goals and experiences. (See Medin, Lynch, Coley, \u0026amp; Atran, 1997, and Wisniewski \u0026amp; Medin, 1994, for discussions of the construction of cues and categories.) A fireground commander, an arson investigator, and an insurance agent will all be aware of different cues and cue patterns in viewing the same house on fire. [\u0026hellip;]\nBecause the little things we call \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; are actually abstractions from the environment, they can be distortions of reality. Feltovich, Spiro, and Coulson (1997) described the ways we simplify the world in trying to make sense of it:\nWe define continuous processes as discrete steps We treat dynamic processes as static We treat simultaneous processes as sequential We treat complex systems as simple and direct causal mechanisms We separate processes that interact We treat conditional relationships as universals We treat heterogeneous components as homogeneous We treat irregular cases as regular ones We treat nonlinear functional relationships as linear We attend to surface elements rather than deep ones We converge on single interpretations rather than multiple interpretations The frame is inferred from a few key anchors When we encounter a new situation or a surprising turn of events, the initial one or two key data elements we experience sometimes serve as anchors for creating an understanding. These anchors elicit the initial frame, and we use that frame to search for more data elements.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nExample 3 [below] shows the process of using anchors to select frames. The decision maker treated each data element as an anchor and used it to frame an explanation for an aviation accident. Each successive data element suggested a new frame, and the person moved from one frame to the next without missing a beat.\nThe inferences used in sensemaking rely on abductive reasoning as well as logical deduction Our research with information operations specialists (Klein, Phillips, et al., 2003) found that they rely on abductive reasoning to a greater extent than following deductive logic. For example, they were more likely to speculate about causes, given effects, than they were to deduce effects from causes. If one event preceded another (simple correlation) they speculated that the first event might have caused the second. They were actively searching for frames to connect the messages they were given.\nAbductive reasoning (e.g., Peirce, 1903) is reasoning to the best explanation. Josephson and Josephson (1994, p. 5) have described a paradigm case for abductive reasoning:\nD is a collection of data (facts, observations, and givens). H explains D (would, if true, explain D). No other hypothesis can explain D as well as H does. Therefore, H is probably true. In other words, if the match between a set of data and a frame is more plausible than the match to any other frame, we accept the first frame as the likely explanation. This is not deductive reasoning, but a form of reasoning that enables us to make sense of uncertain events. It is also a form of reasoning that permits us to generate new hypotheses, based on the frame we adopt.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] People are explanation machines. People will employ whatever tactics are available to help them find connections and identify anchors.\nSensemaking usually ceases when the data and frame are brought into congruence Sensemaking is a Satisficing activity.\nOur observations of sensemaking suggest that, as a deliberate activity, it continues as long as key data elements remain unexplained or key components of a frame remain ambiguous. Once the relevant data are readily accounted for, and the frame seems reasonably valid and specified, the motivation behind sensemaking is diminished. Thus, sensemaking has a stopping point \u0026mdash; it is not an endless effort to grind out more inferences. We note that sensemaking may continue if the potential benefits of further exploration are sufficiently strong. Example 2 shows how the brigadier general continued to make discoveries by further exploring the scene in front of him.\nExperts reason the same way as novices, but have a richer repertoire of frames See Cedric Chin | Expertise Is \u0026lsquo;Just\u0026rsquo; Pattern Matching.\nKlein et al. (2002) reported that expert information operations specialists performed at a much higher level than novices, but both groups employed the same types of logical and abductive inferencing. This finding is in accord with the literature (e.g., Barrows, Feightner, Neufeld, \u0026amp; Norman, 1978; Elstein, Shulman, \u0026amp; Sprafka, 1978; Simon, 1973) reporting that experts and novices showed no differences in their reasoning processes.\nKlein et al. (2002) found that expert and novice information operations specialists both tried to infer cause–effect connections when presented with information operations scenarios. They both tried to infer effects, although the experts were more capable of doing this. They both tried to infer causes from effects. They were both aware of multiple causes, and neither were particularly sensitive to instances when an expected effect did not occur. The experts have the benefit of more knowledge and richer mental models. But in looking at these data and in watching the active connection building of the novices, we did not find that the experts were using different sensemaking strategies from the novices (with a few exceptions, noted later). This finding suggests that little is to be gained by trying to teach novices to think like experts. Novices are already trying to make connections. They just have a limited knowledge base from which to work.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAlthough the experts and novices showed the same types of reasoning strategies, the experts had the advantage of a much stronger understanding of the situations. Their mental models were richer in terms of having greater variety, finer differentiation, and more comprehensive coverage of phenomena. Their comments were deeper, more plausible, showed a greater sensitivity to context, and were more insightful.\nThe mechanism of generating inferences was the same for experts and novices, but the nature of the experts\u0026rsquo; inferences was much more interesting. For example, one of the three scenarios we used, \u0026ldquo;Rebuilding the Schools,\u0026rdquo; included the message, \u0026ldquo;An intel report designates specific patrols that are now being targeted in the eastern Republica Srpska. A group that contains at least three known agitators is targeting the U.S. afternoon Milici patrol for tomorrow and the IPTF patrol for the next day.\u0026rdquo; One of the experts commented that this was very serious, and generated action items to find out why the posture of the agitators had shifted toward violence in this way. He also speculated on ways to manipulate the local chief of police. The second expert saw this as an opportunity to identify and strike at the violent agitators. In contrast, one of the novices commented, \u0026ldquo;There is a group targeting U.S. afternoon patrols \u0026mdash; then move the patrols.\u0026rdquo; The other novice stated, \u0026ldquo;The targeting of the patrols \u0026mdash; what that means is not clear to me. Is there general harassment or actions in the past on what has happened with the patrols?\u0026rdquo;\nGenerally, the novices were less certain about the relevance of messages, and were more likely to interpret messages that were noise in the scenario as important signals. Thus, in \u0026ldquo;Rebuilding the Schools,\u0026rdquo; another message stated that three teenagers were found in a car with contraband cigarettes. One expert commented, \u0026ldquo;Business as usual.\u0026rdquo; The second expert commented, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t care. You could spend a lot of resources on controlled cigarettes \u0026mdash; and why? Unless there is a larger issue, let it go.\u0026rdquo; In contrast, the novices became concerned about this transgression. One wondered if the teenagers were part of a general smuggling gang. Another wanted more data about where the cigarettes came from. A third novice wanted to know what type of suspicious behavior had gotten the teenagers pulled over.\nSensemaking is used to achieve a functional understanding In many settings, experienced practitioners want a functional understanding as well as an abstract understanding. They want to know what to do in a situation. In some domains, an abstract understanding is sufficient for experts. Scientists are usually content with gaining an abstract understanding of events and domains because they rarely are called on to act on this understanding. Intelligence officers can seek an abstract understanding of an adversary if they cannot anticipate how their findings will be applied during military missions. In other domains, experts need a functional understanding along with an abstract understanding. Weather forecasters can seek a functional understanding of a weather system if they have to issue alerts or recommend emergency evacuations in the face of a threatening storm.\n[\u0026hellip;] For the three scenarios we used, the experts were almost three times as likely to make comments about actions that should be taken, compared to the novices. The novices we studied averaged 1.5 action suggestions per scenario and the experts averaged 4.4 action suggestions per scenario.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nCharness (1979) reported the results of a cognitive task analysis conducted with bridge players. The sensemaking of the skilled bridge players was based on what they could or could not achieve with a hand \u0026mdash; the affordances of the hand they were dealt. In contrast, the novices interpreted bridge hands according to more abstract features such as the number of points in the hand.\nPeople primarily rely on just-in-time mental models We distinguish between comprehensive mental models and just-in-time (JIT) mental models. A comprehensive mental model captures the essential relationships. An automobile mechanic has a comprehensive mental model of the braking system of a car. An information technology specialist has a comprehensive mental model of the operating system of a computer. In contrast, most of us have only incomplete ideas of these systems. We have some knowledge of the components, and of the basic causal relationships, but there are large gaps in our understanding. If we have to do our own troubleshooting, we have to go beyond our limited knowledge, make some inferences, and cobble together a notion of what is going on \u0026mdash; a JIT mental model. We occasionally find that even the specialists to whom we turn don\u0026rsquo;t have truly complete mental models, as when a mechanic fails to diagnose and repair an unusual problem or an information technology specialist needs to consult with the manufacturer to figure out why a computer is behaving so strangely.\nThe concept of JIT is not intended to convey time pressure. It refers to the construction of a mental model at the time it is needed, rather than calling forth comprehensive mental models that already have been developed. In most of the incidents we examined, the decision makers did not have a full mental model of the situation or the phenomenon they needed to understand. For example, one of the scenarios we used with information operations specialists contained three critical messages that were embedded in a number of other filler messages: The sewage system in a refugee camp was malfunctioning, refugees were moving from this camp to a second camp, and an outbreak of cholera was reported in the second camp. We believed that the model of events would be clear \u0026mdash; the refugees were getting sick with cholera in the first camp because of the sewage problem and spreading it to the second camp. However, we discovered that none of the information operations specialists, even the experts, understood how cholera is transmitted. Therefore, none of them automatically connected the dots when they read the different messages. A few of the specialists, primarily the experts, did manage to figure out the connection as we presented more pointed clues. They used what they knew about diseases to speculate about causes, and eventually realized what was triggering the cholera outbreak in the second camp.\nWe suggest that people primarily rely on JIT mental models \u0026mdash; building on the local cause–effect connections they know about, instead of having comprehensive mental models of the workings of an entire system. These JIT mental models are constructions, using fragmentary knowledge from long-term memory to build explanations in a context. Just as our memories are partial constructions, using fragments of recall together with beliefs, rules, and other bases of inference, we are claiming that most of our mental models are constructed as the situation warrants. Experienced decision makers have learned a great many simple causal connections, \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; leads to \u0026ldquo;B,\u0026rdquo; along with other relationships. When events occur that roughly correspond to \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B,\u0026rdquo; experienced decision makers can see the connection and reason about the causal relationship. This inference can become an anchor in its own right, if it is sufficiently relevant to the task at hand. And it can lead to a chain of inferences, \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;B,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;C,\u0026rdquo; and so on.\nWe believe that in many domains, people do not have comprehensive mental models but can still perform effectively. The fragmentary mental models of experts are more complete than those of novices.\nSensemaking takes different forms, each with its own dynamics In studying the process of sensemaking in information operations specialists and in other domains, we found different types. If we ignore these types, our account of sensemaking will be too general to be useful. The next section describes the alternative ways that sensemaking can take place. standing. Any cognitive activity, no matter how deliberate, will be influenced by unconscious processes. The range between conscious and unconscious processes can be thought of as a continuum, with pattern matching at one end and comparing different frames at the other end. The blending of conscious and automatic processes varies from one end of the continuum to the other.\nTo illustrate this continuum, consider the recognition-primed decision (RPD) [Recognition-primed decision] model presented by Klein (1998). Level 1 of the RPD model describes a form of decision making that is based on pattern matching and the recognition of typical situations. The initial frame recognition defines cues (the pertinent data), goals, and expectancies. This level of the RPD model corresponds to the basic data–frame connection shown at the top center of Figure 6.1, and in the icon at the beginning of this section. We do not view this recognitional match as an instance of sensemaking.\nKlein also described Level 2 of the RPD model in which the decision maker does deliberate about the nature of the situation, sometimes constructing stories to try to account for the observed data. At Level 2, the decision maker is engaging in the different forms of sensemaking. The data–frame theory is an extension of the story-building strategy described in this Level 2.\nThe initial frame used to explain the data can have important consequences. Thus, a fireground commander has stated that the way an onscene commander sizes up the situation in the first 5 minutes determines how the fire will be fought for the next 5 hours.\nThe forms of sensemaking Also see Example 6.\nSensemaking attempts to connect data and frame The specific frame a person uses depends on the data or information that are available and also on the person\u0026rsquo;s goals, the repertoire of the person\u0026rsquo;s frames, and the person\u0026rsquo;s stance (e.g., current workload, fatigue level, and commitment to an activity).\nWe view sensemaking as a volitional process, rather than an unconscious one. In many instances the automatic recognition of how to frame a set of events will not require a person to engage in deliberate sensemaking. The matching of data and frame is often achieved preconsciously, through pattern matching and recognition.\nWe are not dismissing unconscious processes as concomitants of sensemaking. Rather, we are directing our investigation into incidents where deliberate reasoning is employed to achieve some level of under-\nElaborating the frame As more is learned about the environment, people will extend and elaborate the frame they are using, but will not seek to replace it as long as no surprises or anomalies emerge. They add more details, fill in slots, and so forth.\nQuestioning the frame Questioning begins when we are surprised \u0026mdash; when we have to consider data that are inconsistent with the frame we are using. This is a different activity than elaborating the frame. Lanir (1991) has used the term \u0026ldquo;fundamental surprise\u0026rdquo; to describe situations in which we realize we may have to replace a frame on which we had been depending. [\u0026hellip;]\nIn this aspect of sensemaking, we may not know if the frame is incorrect, if the situation has changed, or if the inconsistent data are inaccurate. At this point, we just realize that some of the data do not match the frame. Frames provide people with expectations; when the expectations are violated, people may start to question the accuracy of the frame.\nWeick (1995) postulated that sensemaking is often initiated by a surprise \u0026mdash; the breakdown in expectations as when unexpected events occur or expected events fail to occur. Our research findings support this assertion. Thus, in the navigation incidents we studied, we found that people who got lost might continue for a long time until they experienced a framebreaker, a \u0026ldquo;moment of untruth,\u0026rdquo; that knocked them out of their existing beliefs and violated their expectancies.\nEven in the navigation incidents we studied, people were often trying to make sense of events even before they encountered a frame breaker. They actively preserved and elaborated their frames until they realized that their frames were flawed. Emotional reactions are also important for initiating sensemaking, by generating a feeling of uncertainty or of distress caused by loss of confidence in a frame.\nProblem detection (e.g., Klein, Pliske, Crandall, \u0026amp; Woods, in press) is a form of sensemaking in which a person begins to question the frame. However, a person will not start to question a frame simply as a result of receiving data that do not conform to the frame. For example, Feltovich et al. (1984) found that experts in pediatric cardiology had more differentiated frames than novices, letting them be more precise about expectations. Novices were fuzzy about what to expect when they looked at test results, and therefore were less likely to notice when expectancies were violated. As a result, when Feltovich et al. presented a \u0026ldquo;garden path\u0026rdquo; scenario (one that suggested an interpretation that turned out to be inaccurate), novices went down the garden path but experts broke free. The experts quickly noticed that the data were not aligning with the initial understanding.\nExample 4 [below] describes a fire captain questioning his frame for the progression of a fire involving a laundry chute (taken from Klein, 1998). He realizes that the data do not match his frame when he sees flames rolling along the ceiling of the fourth-floor landing; at this point he recognizes the fire is much more involved than he originally expected, and he is able to quickly adapt his strategies to accommodate the seriousness of the fire.\nPreserving the frame We typically preserve a frame by explaining away the data that do not match the frame. Sometimes, we are well-advised to discard unreliable or transient data. But when the inconsistent data are indicators that the explanation may be faulty, it is a mistake to ignore and discard these data. Vaughan (1996) describes how organizations engage in a routinization of deviance, as they explain away anomalies and in time come to see them as familiar and not particularly threatening. Our account of preserving a frame may help to describe how routinization of deviance is sustained.\nFeltovich, Coulson, and Spiro (2001) have cataloged a set of \u0026ldquo;knowledge shields\u0026rdquo; [Knowledge shields] that cardiologists use to preserve a frame in the face of countervailing evidence. [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] It is not as if people seek to fixate. Rather, people are skilled at forming explanations. And they are skilled at explaining how inconvenient data may have arisen accidentally \u0026mdash; using the knowledge shields [\u0026hellip;]\nComparing multiple frames We sometimes need to deliberately compare different frames to judge what is going on.\nFor example, in reviewing incidents from a study of nurses in an NICU (Crandall \u0026amp; Gamblian, 1991), we found several cases where the nurses gathered evidence in support of one frame \u0026mdash; that the neonate was making a good recovery \u0026mdash; while at the same time elaborated a second, opposing frame \u0026mdash; that the neonate was developing sepsis. [See Example 5]\nIn some of our incident analyses, we have found that people were tracking up to three frames simultaneously. We speculate that this may be an upper limit; people may track two to three frames simultaneously, but rarely more than three.\nIn their research on pediatric cardiologists, Feltovich et al. (1984) found that when the experts broke free of the fixation imposed by a garden path scenario, they would identify one, two, or even three alternative frames. The experts deliberately selected frames that would sharpen the distinctions that were relevant. They identified a cluster of diseases that shared many symptoms in order to make fine-grained diagnoses. Feltovich et al. referred to this strategy as using a \u0026ldquo;logical competitor set\u0026rdquo; (LCS) as a means of pinpointing critical details. To Feltovich et al., the LCS is an interconnected memory unit that can be considered a kind of category. Activation of one member of the LCS will activate the full set because these are the similar cardiac conditions that have to be contrasted. Depending on the demands of the task, the decision maker may set out to test all the members of the set simultaneously, or may test only the most likely member. Rudolph (2003) sees this strategy as a means of achieving a differential diagnosis. The anesthesiologists in her study changed the way they sought information \u0026mdash; their search strategies became more directed and efficient when they could work from a set of related and competing frames.\nWe also speculate that if a data element is used as an anchor in one frame, it will be difficult to use it in a second, competing frame. The rival uses of the same anchor may create conceptual strain, and this would limit a person\u0026rsquo;s ability to compare frames.\nReframing In reframing, we are not simply accumulating inconsistencies and contrary evidence. We need the replacement frame to guide the way we search for and define cues, and we need these cues to suggest the replacement frame. Both processes happen simultaneously.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nDuncker (1945) introduced the concept that gaining insight into the solution to a problem may require reframing or reformulating the way the problem is understood. Duncker studied the way subjects approached the now-classic \u0026ldquo;radiation problem\u0026rdquo; (how to use radiation to destroy a tumor without damaging the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor). As long as the problem was stated in that form, subjects had difficulty finding a solution. Some subjects were able to reframe the problem, from \u0026ldquo;how to use radiation to treat a tumor without destroying healthy tissue\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;how to minimize the intensity of the radiation except at the site of the tumor.\u0026rdquo; This new frame enabled subjects to generate a solution of aiming weak radiation beams that converged on the tumor.\nSeeking a frame We may deliberately try to find a frame when confronted with data that just do not make sense, or when a frame is questioned and is obviously inadequate. Sometimes, we can replace one frame with another, but at other times we have to try to find or construct a frame. We may look for analogies [Reasoning from analogies] and also search for more data in order to find anchors that can be used to construct a new frame.\nPotential applications of the data-frame theory Decision support systems In designing DSSs, one of the lessons from the literature is that more data does not necessarily lead to more accurate explanations and predictions. Weick (1995) criticized the information-processing metaphor for viewing sensemaking and related problems as settings where people need more information. Weick argued that a central problem requiring sensemaking is that there are too many potential meanings, not too few \u0026mdash; equivocality rather than uncertainty. For Weick, resolving equivocality requires values, priorities, and clarity about preferences, rather than more information.\nHeuer (1999) made a similar point, arguing that intelligence analysts need help in evaluating and interpreting data, not in acquiring more and more data. The research shows that accuracy increases with data elements up to a point (perhaps 8–10 data elements) and then asymptotes while confidence continues to increase [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWe can offer some guidance for the field of DSSs:\nAttempts to improve judgment and decision quality by increasing the amount of data are unlikely to be as effective as supports to the evaluation of data. Efforts to increase information rate can actually interfere with skilled performance. The DSS should not be restricted to logical inferences, because of the importance of abductive inferences. The progression of data-information-knowledge-understanding that is shown as a rationale for decision support systems is misleading. It enshrines the information-processing approach to sensemaking, and runs counter to an ecological approach that asserts that the data themselves need to be constructed. Data fusion algorithms pose opportunities to reduce information overload, but also pose challenges to sensemaking if the logical bases of the algorithms are underspecified. Given the limited number of anchors that are typically used, people may benefit from a DSS that helps them track the available anchors. DSSs may be evaluated by applying metrics such as the time needed to catch inconsistencies inserted into scenarios and the time and effort needed to detect faulty data fusion. Training programs The concept of sensemaking also appears to be relevant to the development of training programs. For example, one piece of advice that is often given is that decision makers can reduce fixation errors by avoiding early adoption of a hypothesis. But the data–frame theory regards early commitment to a hypothesis as inevitable and advantageous. Early commitment, the rapid recognition of a frame, permits more efficient information gathering and more specific expectancies that can be violated by anomalies, permitting adjustment and reframing. This claim can be tested by encouraging subjects to delay their interpretation, to see if that improves or hinders performance. It can be falsified by finding cases where the domain practitioner does not enact \u0026ldquo;early\u0026rdquo; recognition of a frame.\nA second implication of sensemaking is the use of feedback in training. Practice without feedback is not likely to result in effective training. But it is not trivial to provide feedback. Outcome feedback is not as useful as process feedback (Salas, Wilson, Burke, \u0026amp; Bowers, 2002), because knowing that performance was inadequate is not as valuable as diagnosing what needs to be changed. However, neither outcome nor process feedback is straightforward. Trainees have to make sense of the feedback.\nFeedback does not inevitably lead to better frames. The frames determine the way feedback is understood. Similarly, process feedback is best understood when a person already has a good mental model of how to perform the task. A person with a poor mental model can misinterpret process feedback.\nA third issue that is relevant to training concerns the so-called confirmation bias. The decision research literature (Mynatt, Doherty, \u0026amp; Tweney, 1977; Wason, 1960) suggests that people are more inclined to look for and take notice of information that confirms a view than information that disconfirms it.\nIn contrast, we assert that people are using frames, not merely trying to confirm hypotheses. In natural settings, skilled decision makers shift into an active mode of elaborating the competing frame once they detect the possibility that their frame is inaccurate. This tactic is shown in the earlier NICU Example 5 where the nurse tracked two frames. A person uses an initial frame (hypothesis) as a guide in acquiring more information, and, typically, that information will be consistent with the frame. Furthermore, skilled decision makers such as expert forecasters have learned to seek disconfirming evidence where appropriate.\nIt is not trivial to search for disconfirming information \u0026mdash; it may require the activation of a competing frame. Patterson, Woods, Sarter, and WattsPerotti (1998), studying intelligence analysts who reviewed articles in the open literature, found that if the initial articles were misleading, the rest of the analyses would often be distorted because subsequent searches, and their reviews were conditioned by the initial frame formed from the first articles. The initial anchors affect the frame that is adopted, and that frame guides information seeking. What may look like a confirmation bias may simply be the use of a frame to guide information seeking. One need not think of it as a bias.\nAccordingly, we offer the following recommendations:\nWe suggest that training programs advocating a delayed commitment to a frame are unrealistic. Instead, training is needed in noticing anomalies and diagnosing them. Training may be useful in helping people \u0026ldquo;get found.\u0026rdquo; For example, helicopter pilots are taught to navigate from one waypoint to another. However, if the helicopters are exposed to antiair attacks, they will typically take violent evasive maneuvers to avoid the threat. These maneuvers not infrequently leave the pilots disoriented. Training might be helpful in developing problem-solving routines for getting found once the pilots are seriously lost. Training to expand a repertoire of causal relationships may be more helpful than teaching comprehensive mental models. Training in generic sensemaking does not appear to be feasible. We have not seen evidence for a general sensemaking skill. Some of the incidents we have collected do suggest differences in an \u0026ldquo;adaptive mind-set\u0026rdquo; of actively looking to make sense of events, as in Example 2. It may be possible to develop and expand this type of attitude. Training may be better aimed at key aspects responsible for effective sensemaking, such as increasing the range and richness of frames. For example, Phillips et al. (2003) achieved a significant improvement in sensemaking for Marine officers trained with tactical decision games that were carefully designed to improve the richness of mental models and frames. Training may be enhanced by verifying that feedback is appropriately presented and understood. Training may also be useful for helping people to manage their attention to become less vulnerable to distractions. Dismukes (1998) described how interruptions can result in aviation accidents. Jones and Endsley (1995, 2000) reviewed aviation records and found that many of the errors in Endsley\u0026rsquo;s (1995) Level 1 situation awareness (perception of events) were compounded by ineffective attention management—failure to monitor critical data, and misperceptions and memory loss due to distractions and/ or high workload. The management of attention would seem to depend on the way frames are activated and prioritized. Training scenarios can be developed for all of the sensemaking activities shown in Figure 6.1: elaborating a frame, questioning a frame, evaluating a frame, comparing alternative frames, reframing a situation, and seeking anchors in order to generate a useful frame. Metrics for sensemaking training might include the time and accuracy in detecting anomalies, the degree of concordance with subject-matter expert assessments, and the time and success in recovering from a mistaken interpretation of a situation. Testable aspects of the data-frame theory Now that we have described the data–frame theory, we want to consider ways of testing it. Based on the implications described previously, and our literature review, we have identified several hypotheses about the data– frame theory:\nWe hypothesize that frames are evoked/constructed using only three or four anchors. We hypothesize that if someone uses a data element as an anchor for one frame, it will be difficult to use that same anchor as a part of a second, competing frame. We hypothesize that the quality of the initial frame considered will be better than chance—that people identify frames using experience, rather than randomly. Based on past research on recognitional decision making, we assert that the greater the experience level, the greater the improvement over chance of the frame initially identified. We hypothesize that introducing a corrupted, inaccurate anchor early in the message stream will have a correspondingly greater negative effect on sensemaking accuracy than introducing it later in the sequence (see Patterson et al., 1998). We hypothesize that increased information and anchors will have a nonlinear relationship to performance, first increasing it, then plateauing, and then in some cases, decreasing. This claim is based on research literature cited previously, and also on the basic data–frame concept and the consequences of adding too many data without a corresponding way to frame them. We hypothesize that experts and novices will show similar reasoning strategies when trying to make inferences from data. We hypothesize that methods designed to prevent premature commitment to a frame (e.g., the recognition/metacognition approach of Cohen, Adelman, Tolcott, Bresnick, \u0026amp; Marvin, 1992) will degrade performance under conditions where active attention management is needed (using frames) and where people have difficulty finding useful frames. The findings reported by Rudolph (2003) suggest that failure to achieve early commitment to a frame can actually promote fixation because commitment to a frame is needed to generate expectancies (and to support the recognition of anomaly) and to conduct effective tests. The data–frame concept is that a frame is needed to efficiently and effectively understand data, and that attempting to review data without introducing frames is unrealistic and unproductive. We hypothesize that people can track up to three frames at a time, but that performance may degrade if more than three frames must be simultaneously considered. We also speculate that individual differences (e.g., tolerance for ambiguity, need for cognition) should affect sensemaking performance, and that this can be a fruitful line of research. Similarly, cultural differences, such as holistic versus analytical perspectives, should affect sensemaking (Nisbett, 2003). Furthermore, it may be possible to establish priming techniques to elicit frames and to demonstrate this elicitation in the sensemaking and information management activities shown by subjects. Summary Sensemaking is the deliberate effort to understand events. It serves a variety of functions, such as explaining anomalies, anticipating difficulties, detecting problems, guiding information search, and taking effective action. We have presented a data–frame theory of the process of sensemaking in natural settings.\nThe theory contains a number of assertions. First, the theory posits that the interaction between the data and the frame is a central feature of sensemaking. The data, along with the goals, expertise, and stance of the sensemaker, combine to generate a relevant frame. The frame subsequently shapes which data from the environment will be recognized as pertinent, how the data will be interpreted, and what role they will play when incorporated into the evolving frame. Our view of the data–frame relationship mirrors Neisser\u0026rsquo;s (1976) cyclical account of perception, in that available information, or data, modifies one\u0026rsquo;s schema, or frame, of the present environment, which in turn directs one\u0026rsquo;s exploration and/or sampling of that environment. The data are used to select and alter the frame. The frame is used to select and configure the data. In this manner, the frame and the data work in concert to generate an explanation. The implication of this continuous, two-way, causal interaction is that both sensemaking and data exploration suffer when the frame is inadequate. Second, our observations in several domains suggest that people select frames based on a small number of anchors—highly salient data elements. The initial few anchors seem to determine the type of explanatory account that is formed, with no more than three to four anchors active at any point in time.\nThird, our research is consistent with prior work (Barrows et al., 1978; Chase \u0026amp; Simon, 1973; Elstein, 1989) showing that expert–novice differences in sensemaking performance are not due to superior reasoning on the part of the expert or mastery of advanced reasoning strategies, but rather to the quality of the frame that is brought to bear. Experts have more factual knowledge about their domain, have built up more experiences, and have more knowledge about cause-and-effect relationships.\nExperts are more likely to generate a good explanation of the situation than novices because their frame enables them to select the right data from the environment, interpret them more accurately, and see more pertinent patterns and connections in the data stream.\nFourth, we suggest that people more often construct JIT mental models from available knowledge than draw on comprehensive mental models. We have not found evidence that people often form comprehensive mental models. Instead, people rely on JIT models, constructed from fragments, in a way that is analogous to the construction of memory. In complex and open systems, a comprehensive mental model is unrealistic.\nThere is some evidence that in domains dealing with closed systems, such as medicine (i.e., the human body can be considered a roughly closed system), an expert can plausibly develop an adequately comprehensive mental model for some medical conditions. However, most people and even most experts rely on fragments of local cause–effect connections, rules of thumb, patterns of cues, and other linkages and relationships between cues and information to guide the sensemaking process (and indeed other high-level cognitive processes).\nThe concept of JIT mental models is interesting for several reasons. We believe that the fragmentary knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, rules, principles) representing one domain can be applied to a sensemaking activity in a separate domain. If people have worked out complex and comprehensive mental models in a domain, they will have difficulty in generalizing this knowledge to another domain, whereas the generalization of fragmentary knowledge is much easier. Fragmentary knowledge contributes to the frame that is constructed by the sensemaker; fragmentary knowledge therefore helps to guide the selection and interpretation of data. We do not have to limit our study of mental models to the static constructs and beliefs that people hold; we can also study the process of compiling JIT mental models from a person\u0026rsquo;s knowledge base.\nFifth, the data–frame account of sensemaking is different from an information-processing description of generating inferences on data elements. Sensemaking is motivated by the person\u0026rsquo;s goals and by the need to balance the data with the frame—a person experiences confusion in having to consider data that appear relevant and yet are not integrated. Successful sensemaking achieves a mental balance by fitting data into a well-framed relationship with other data. This balance will be temporary because dynamic conditions continually alter the landscape. Nevertheless, the balance, when achieved, is emotionally satisfying in itself. People do not merely churn out inferences. They are actively trying to experience a match, however fleeting, between data and frame.\nExample 1: The ominous airplanes Major A. S. discussed an incident that occurred soon after 9/11 in which he was able to determine the nature of overflight activity around nuclear power plants and weapons facilities. This incident occurred while he was an analyst. He noticed that there had been increased reports in counterintelligence outlets of overflight incidents around nuclear power plants and weapons facilities. At that time, all nuclear power plants and weapons facilities were \u0026ldquo;temporary restricted flight\u0026rdquo; zones. So this meant there were suddenly a number of reports of small, low-flying planes around these facilities. At face value it appeared that this constituted a terrorist threat \u0026mdash; that \u0026ldquo;bad guys\u0026rdquo; had suddenly increased their surveillance activities. There had not been any reports of this activity prior to 9/11 (but there had been no temporary flight restrictions before 9/11 either).\nMajor A. S. obtained access to the Al Qaeda tactics manual, which instructed Al Qaeda members not to bring attention to themselves. This piece of information helped him to begin to form the hypothesis that these incidents were bogus \u0026mdash; \u0026ldquo;It was a gut feeling, it just didn\u0026rsquo;t sit right. If I was a terrorist I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing this.\u0026rdquo;\nHe recalled thinking to himself, \u0026ldquo;If I was trying to do surveillance how would I do it?\u0026rdquo; From the Al Qaeda manual, he knew they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t break the rules, which to him meant that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t break any of the flight rules. He asked himself, \u0026ldquo;If I\u0026rsquo;m a terrorist doing surveillance on a potential target, how do I act?\u0026rdquo; He couldn\u0026rsquo;t put together a sensible story that had a terrorist doing anything as blatant as overflights in an air traffic restricted area.\nHe thought about who might do that, and kept coming back to the overflights as some sort of mistake or blunder. That suggested student pilots to him because \u0026ldquo;basically, they are idiots.\u0026rdquo;\nHe was an experienced pilot. He knew that during training, it was absolutely standard for pilots to be instructed that if they got lost, the first thing they should look for were nuclear power plants. He told us that \u0026ldquo;an entire generation of pilots\u0026rdquo; had been given this specific instruction when learning to fly. Because they are so easily sighted, and are easily recognized landmarks, nuclear power plants are very useful for getting one\u0026rsquo;s bearings. He also knew that during pilot training the visual flight rules would instruct students to fly east to west and low \u0026mdash; about 1,500 feet. Basically students would fly low patterns, from east to west, from airport to airport.\nIt took Major A. S. about 3 weeks to do his assessment. He found all relevant message traffic by searching databases for about 3 days. He picked the three geographic areas with the highest number of reports and focused on those. He developed overlays to show where airports were located and the different flight routes between them. In all three cases, the \u0026ldquo;temporary restricted flight\u0026rdquo; zones (and the nuclear power plants) happened to fall along a vector with an airport on either end. This added support to his hypothesis that the overflights were student pilots, lost and using the nuclear power plants to reorient, just as they had been told to do.\nHe also checked to see if any of the pilots of the flights that had been cited over nuclear plants or weapons facilities were interviewed by the FBI. In the message traffic, he discovered that about 10% to 15% of these pilots had been detained, but none had panned out as being \u0026ldquo;nefarious pilots.\u0026rdquo;\nWith this information, Major A. S. settled on an answer to his question about who would break the rules: student pilots. The students were probably following visual flight rules, not any sort of flight plan. That is, they were flying by looking out the window and navigating.\nThis instance of sensemaking was triggered by the detection of an anomaly. But we engage in sensemaking even without surprises, simply to extend our grasp of what is going on.\nExample 2: The reconnaissance team During a Marine Corps exercise, a reconnaissance team leader and his team were positioned overlooking a vast area of desert. The fire team leader, a young sergeant, viewed the desert terrain carefully and observed an enemy tank move along a trail and then take cover. He sent this situation report to headquarters. However, a brigadier general, experienced in desert-mechanized operations, had arranged to go into the field as an observer. He also spotted the enemy tank. But he knew that tanks tend not to operate alone. Therefore, based on the position of that one tank, he focused on likely overwatch positions and found another tank. Based on the section\u0026rsquo;s position and his understanding of the terrain, he looked at likely positions for another section and found a well-camouflaged second section. He repeated this process to locate the remaining elements of a tank company that was well-camouflaged and blocking a key choke point in the desert. The size and position of the force suggested that there might be other higher and supporting elements in the area, and so he again looked at likely positions for command and logistics elements. He soon spotted an otherwise superbly camouflaged logistics command post. In short, the brigadier general was able to see and understand and make more sense of the situation than the sergeant. He had much more experience, and he was able to develop a fuller picture rather than record discrete events that he noticed.\nExample 3: The investigation of a helicopter accident An accident happened during an Army training exercise. Two helicopters collided. Everyone in one helicopter died and everyone in the other helicopter survived. Our informant, Captain B., was on the battalion staff at the time.\nImmediately after the accident, Captain B. suspected that because this was a night mission there could have been some complications due to flying with night-vision goggles that led one helicopter to drift into the other.\nThen Captain B. found out that weather had been bad during the exercise, and he thought that was probably the cause of the accident; perhaps they had flown into some clouds at night.\nThen Captain B. learned that there was a sling on one of the crashed helicopters, and that this aircraft had been in the rear of the formation. He also found out that an alternate route had been used, and that weather wasn\u0026rsquo;t a factor because they were flying below the clouds when the accident happened. So Captain B. believed that the last helicopter couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down properly because of the sling. The weight of the sling would make it harder to stop to avoid running into another aircraft. He also briefly suspected that pilot experience was a contributing factor, because they should have understood the risks better and kept better distance between aircraft, but he dismissed this idea because he found out that although the lead pilot hadn\u0026rsquo;t flown much recently, the copilot was very experienced. But Captain B. was puzzled about why the sling-loaded helicopter would have been in trail. It should have been in the lead because it was less agile than the others. Captain B. was also puzzled about the route \u0026mdash; the entire formation had to make a big U-turn before landing and this might have been a factor too. So this story, though much different than the first ones, still had some gaps.\nFinally, Captain B. found out that the group had not rehearsed the alternate route. The initial route was to fly straight in, with the sling-loaded helicopter in the lead. And that worked well because the sling load had to be delivered in the far end of the landing zone. But because of a shift in the wind direction, they had to shift the landing approach to do a U-turn. When they shifted the landing approach, the sling load had to be put in the back of the formation so that the load could be dropped off in the same place. When the lead helicopter came in fast and then went into the U-turn, the next two helicopters diverted because they could not execute the turn safely at those speeds and were afraid to slow down because the sling-loaded helicopter was right behind them. The sling-loaded helicopter continued with the maneuver and collided with the lead helicopter.\nAt first, Captain B. had a single datum, the fact that the accident took place at night. He used this as an anchor to construct a likely scenario. Then he learned about the bad weather, and used this fact to anchor an alternate and more plausible explanation.\nNext he learned about the sling load, and fastened on this as an anchor because sling loads are so dangerous. The weather and nighttime conditions may still have been factors, but they did not anchor the new explanation, which centered around the problem of maneuvering with a sling load. Captain B.\u0026rsquo;s previous explanations faded away. Even so, Captain B. knew his explanation was incomplete, because a key datum was inconsistent \u0026mdash; why was the helicopter with the sling load placed in the back of the formation?\nEventually, he compiled the anchors: helicopter with a sling load, shift in wind direction, shift to a riskier mission formation, unexpected difficulty of executing the U-turn. Now he had the story of the accident. He also had other pieces of information that contributed, such as time pressure that precluded practicing the new formation, and command failure in approving the risky mission.\nExample 4: The laundry chute fire A civilian call came in about 2030 hours that there was a fire in the basement of an apartment complex. Arriving at the scene of the call about 5 minutes later, Captain L. immediately radioed to the dispatcher that the structure was a four-story brick building, \u0026ldquo;nothing showing,\u0026rdquo; meaning no smoke or flames were apparent. He was familiar with this type of apartment building structure, so he and his driver went around the side of the building to gain access to the basement through one of the side stairwells located to either side of the building. Captain L. saw immediately that the clothes chute was the source of the fire.\nLooking up the chute, which ran to the top floor, Captain L. could see nothing but smoke and flames. The duct was constructed of thin metal but with a surrounding wooden skirt throughout its length. Visibility was poor because of the engulfing flames, hampering the initial appraisal of the amount of involvement. Nevertheless, on the assumption that the civilian call came close in time to the start of the fire and that the firefighters\u0026rsquo; response time was quick, Captain L. instantly assessed the point of attack to be the second-floor clothes chute access point.\nCaptain L. told the lieutenant in charge of the first arriving crew to take a line into the building. Three crews were sent upstairs, to the first, second, and third floors, and each reported back that the fire had already spread past them.\nCaptain L. made his way to the front of the building. Unexpectedly, he saw flames rolling along the ceiling of the fourth-floor landing of the glass encased front stairwell external to the building. Immediately recognizing that the fire must be quite involved, Captain L. switched his strategy to protecting the front egress for the now prime objective of search and rescue (S/R) operations. He quickly dispatched his truck crew to do S/R on the fourth floor and then radioed for a \u0026ldquo;triple two\u0026rdquo; alarm at this location to get the additional manpower to evacuate the entire building and fight this new front. Seven minutes had now elapsed since the first call.\nOn arrival, the new units were ordered to protect the front staircase, lay lines to the fourth floor to push the blaze back down the hall, and aid in S/ R of the entire building. Approximately 20 people were eventually evacuated, and total time to containment was about an hour.\nExample 5: Comparison of frames in an NICU This baby was my primary; I knew the baby and I knew how she normally acted. Generally she was very alert, was on feedings, and was off IVs. Her lab work on that particular morning looked very good. She was progressing extremely well and hadn\u0026rsquo;t had any of the setbacks that many other preemies have. She typically had numerous apnea episodes and then bradys, but we could easily stimulate her to end these episodes. At 2:30 her mother came in to hold her and I noticed that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t as responsive to her mother as she normally was. She just lay there and half looked at her. When we lifted her arm it fell right back down in the bed and she had no resistance to being handled. This limpness was very unusual for her.\nOn this day, the monitors were fine, her blood pressure was fine, and she was tolerating feedings all right. There was nothing to suggest that anything was wrong except that I knew the baby and I knew that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t acting normally. At about 3:30 her color started to change. Her skin was not its normal pink color and she had blue rings around her eyes. During the shift she seemed to get progressively grayer. Then at about 4:00, when I was turning her feeding back on, I found that there was a large residual of food in her stomach. I thought maybe it was because her mother had been holding her and the feeding just hadn\u0026rsquo;t settled as well. By 5:00 I had a baby who was gray and had blue rings around her eyes. She was having more and more episodes of apnea and bradys; normally she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any bradys when her mom was holding her. Still, her blood pressure hung in there. Her temperature was just a little bit cooler than normal. Her abdomen was a little more distended, up 2 cm from early in the morning, and there was more residual in her stomach. This was a baby who usually had no residual and all of a sudden she had 5 cc to 9 cc. We gave her suppositories thinking maybe she just needed to stool. Although having a stool reduced her girth, she still looked gray and was continuing to have more apnea and bradys. At this point, her blood gas wasn\u0026rsquo;t good so we hooked her back up to the oxygen. On the doctor\u0026rsquo;s orders, we repeated the lab work. The results confirmed that this baby had an infection, but we knew she was in trouble even before we got the lab work back.\nExample 6: Flying blind This incident occurred during a solo cross-country flight (a required part of aviation training to become a private pilot) in a Cessna 172. The pilot\u0026rsquo;s plan was for a 45-minute trip. The weather for this journey was somewhat perfect \u0026mdash; sunny, warm, few clouds, not much haze. He had several-mile visibility, but not unlimited. He was navigating by landmarks.\nThe first thing he did was build a flight plan, including: heading, course, planned airspeed, planned altitude, way points in between each leg of the journey, destination (diagram of the airport), and a list of radio frequencies. His flight instructor okayed this flight plan. Then he went through his preflight routine. He got in the airplane, checked the fuel and the ignition (to make sure the engine was running properly), set the altitude (by calibrating the altimeter with the published elevation of the airport where he was located; this is pretty straightforward), and calibrated the directional gyro (DG).\nHe took off and turned in the direction he needed to go. During the initial several minutes of his flight, he would be flying over somewhat familiar terrain, because he had flown in this general direction several times during his training, including a dual cross-country (a cross-country flight with an instructor) to an airport in the vicinity of his intended course for that day. About a half hour into the flight, the pilot started getting the feeling that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t where he was supposed to be. Something didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. But he couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out where he was on the map \u0026mdash; all the little towns looked similar.\nWhat bothered him the most at this point was that his instruments had been telling him he was on course, so how did he get lost? He checked his DG against the compass (while flying as straight and level as he could get), and realized his DG was about 20 to 30 degrees off. That\u0026rsquo;s a very significant inaccuracy. So he stopped trusting his DG, and he had a rough estimate of how far off he was at this point. He knew he\u0026rsquo;d been going in the right general direction (south), but that he had just drifted east more than he should have.\nHe decided to keep flying south because he knew he would be crossing the Ohio River. This is a very obvious landmark that he could use as an anchor to discover his true position. Sure enough, the arrangement of the factories on the banks of the river was different from what he was expecting. He abandoned his expectations and tried to match the factory configuration on the river to his map. In this way, he was able to create a new hypothesis about his location.\nA particular bend in the river had power plants/factories with large smokestacks. The map he had showed whether a particular vertical obstruction (like a smoke stack or radio antenna) is a single structure or multiple structures bunched together. He noted how these landmarks lined up, trying to establish a pattern to get him to the airport. He noticed a railroad crossing that was crossed by high-tension power lines. He noticed the lines first and thought, \u0026ldquo;Is this the one crossed by the railroad track that leads right into the airport?\u0026rdquo; Then he followed it straight to his destination.\nIn this example, we see several of the sensemaking activities. The pilot started with a good frame, in the form of a map and knowledge of how to use basic navigational equipment. Unknown to him, the equipment was malfunctioning. Nevertheless, he attempted to elaborate the frame as his journey progressed. He encountered data that made him question his frame \u0026mdash; question his position on the map. But he explained these data away and preserved the frame. Eventually, he reached a point where the deviation was too great, and where the topology was too discrepant from his expectancies. He used some fragmentary knowledge to devise a strategy for recovering \u0026mdash; he knew that he was heading south, and would eventually cross the Ohio River, and he prepared his maps to check his location at that time. The Ohio River was a major landmark, a dominating anchor, and he hoped he could discard all of his confused notions about location and start fresh, using the Ohio River and seeing what map features corresponded to the visual features he would spot. He also had a rough idea of how far he had drifted from his original course, so he could start his search from a likely point. He could not have successfully reoriented earlier because he simply did not have a sufficient set of useful anchors to fix his position.\nExample 6 illustrates most of the sensemaking types shown in Figure 6.1. The example shows the initial data–frame match: The pilot started off with a firm belief that he knew where he was. As he proceeded, he elaborated on his frame by incorporating various landmarks. His elaboration also helped him preserve his frame, as he explained away some potential discrepancies. Eventually, he did question his understanding. He did realize that he was lost. He had no alternate frame ready as a replacement, and no easy way to construct a new frame. But he was able to devise a strategy that would let him use a few anchors (the Ohio River and the configuration of factories) to find his position on his map. He used this new frame to locate his destination airport.\nBibliography References Klein, Gary, Jennifer Phillips, Erica Rall, and Deborah Peluso. n.d. “A Data-Frame Theory of Sensemaking.” Accessed September 11, 2023. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303171216_A_data-frame_theory_of_sensemaking.

For two decades we inhabited the double solitude of my family farmhouse in New Hampshire, writing poems, loving the countryside. She was forty-seven when she died. If anyone had asked us, \u0026ldquo;Which year was the best, of your lives together?\u0026rdquo; we could have agreed on an answer: \u0026ldquo;the one we remember least.\u0026rdquo; There were sorrowful years\u0026mdash;the death of her father, my cancers, her depressions\u0026mdash;and there were also years of adventure: a trip to China and Japan, two trips to India; years when my children married; years when the grandchildren were born; years of triumph as Jane began her public life in poetry: her first book, her first poem in the New Yorker. The best moment of our lives was one quiet repeated day of work in our house. Not everyone understood. Visitors, especially from New York, would spend a weekend with us and say as they left: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really pretty here\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;in Vermont,\u0026rdquo; many added) \u0026ldquo;with your house, the pond, the hills, but . . . but . . . but . . . what do you do?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat we did: we got up early in the morning. I brought Jane coffee in bed. She walked the dog as I started writing, then climbed the stairs to work at her own desk on her own poems. We had lunch. We lay down together. We rose and worked at secondary things. I read aloud to Jane; we played scoreless ping-pong; we read the mail; we worked again. We ate supper, talked, read books sitting across from each other in the living room, and went to sleep. If we were lucky the phone didn\u0026rsquo;t ring all day. In January Jane dreamed of flowers, planning expansion and refinement of the garden. From late March into October she spent hours digging, applying fifty-year-old Holstein manure from under the barn, planting, transplanting, and weeding. Sometimes I went off for two nights to read my poems, essential to the economy, and Jane wrote a poem called \u0026ldquo;Alone for a Week.\u0026rdquo; Later Jane flew away for readings and I loathed being the one left behind. (I filled out coupons from magazines and ordered useless objects.) We traveled south sometimes in cold weather: to Key West in December, a February week in Barbados, to Florida during baseball\u0026rsquo;s spring training, to Bermuda. Rarely we flew to England or Italy for two weeks. Three hundred and thirty days a year we inhabited this old house and the same day\u0026rsquo;s adventurous routine.\nWhat we did: love. We did not spend our days gazing into each other\u0026rsquo;s eyes. We did that gazing when we made love or when one of us was in trouble, but most of the time our gazes met and entwined as they looked at a third thing. Third things are essential to marriages, objects or practices or habits or arts or institutions or games or human beings that provide a site of joint rapture or contentment. Each member of a couple is separate; the two come together in double attention. Lovemaking is not a third thing but two-in-one. John Keats can be a third thing, or the Boston Symphony Orchestra, or Dutch interiors, or Monopoly. For many couples, children are a third thing. Jane and I had no children of our own; we had our cats and dog to fuss and exclaim over\u0026mdash;and later my five grandchildren from an earlier marriage. We had our summer afternoons at the pond, which for ten years made a third thing. After naps we loaded up books and blankets and walked across Route 4 and the old railroad to the steep slippery bank that led down to our private beach on Eagle Pond. Soft moss underfoot sent little red flowers up. Ghost birches leaned over water with wild strawberry plants growing under them. Over our heads white pines reared high, and oaks that warned us of summer\u0026rsquo;s end late in August by dropping green metallic acorns. Sometimes a mink scooted among ferns. After we acquired Gus he joined the pond ecstasy, chewing on stones. Jane dozed in the sun as I sat in the shade reading and occasionally taking a note in a blank book. From time to time we swam and dried in the heat. Then, one summer, leakage from the Danbury landfill turned the pond orange. It stank. The water was not hazardous but it was ruined. A few years later the pond came back but we seldom returned to our afternoons there. Sometimes you lose a third thing.\nThe South Danbury Christian Church became large in our lives. We were both deacons and Jane was treasurer for a dozen years, utter miscasting and a source of annual anxiety when the treasurer\u0026rsquo;s report was due. I collected the offering; Jane counted and banked it. Once a month she prepared communion and I distributed it. For the Church Fair we both cooked and I helped with the auction. Besides the Church itself, building and community, there was Christianity, the Gospels, and the work of theologians and mystics. Typically we divided our attentions: I read Meister Eckhart while Jane studied Julian of Norwich. I read the Old Testament aloud to her, and the New. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the Bible, I was reading aloud late Henry James or Mark Twain or Edith Wharton or Wordworth\u0026rsquo;s Prelude. Reading aloud was a daily connection. When I first pronounced The Ambassadors, Jane had never read it, and I peeked at her flabbergasted face as the boat bearing Chad and Mme. de Vionnet rounded the bend toward Lambert Strether. Three years later, when I had acquired a New York Edition of Henry James, she asked me to read her The Ambassadors again. Late James is the best prose for reading aloud. Saying one of his interminable sentences, the voice must drop pitch every time he interrupts his syntax with periphrasis, and drop again when periphrasis interrupts periphrasis, and again, and then step the pitch up, like climbing stairs in the dark, until the original tone concludes the sentence. One\u0026rsquo;s larynx could write a doctoral dissertation on James\u0026rsquo;s syntax.\nLiterature in general was a constant. Often at the end of the day Jane would speak about what she had been reading, her latest intense and obsessive absorption in an author: Keats for two years, Chekhov, Elizabeth Bishop. In reading and in everything else, we made clear boundaries, dividing our literary territories. I did not go back to Keats until she had done with him. By and large Jane read intensively while I read extensively. Like a male, I lusted to acquire all the great books of the world and add them to my life list. One day I would realize: I\u0026rsquo;ve never read Darwin! Adam Smith! Gibbon! Gibbon became an obsession with me, then his sources, then all ancient history, then all narrative history. For a few years I concentrated on Henry Adams, even reading six massive volumes of letters.\nBut there was also ping-pong. When we added a new bedroom, we extended the rootcellar enough to set a ping-pong table into it, and for years we played every afternoon. Jane was assiduous, determined, vicious, and her reach was not so wide as mine. When she couldn\u0026rsquo;t reach a shot I called her \u0026ldquo;Stubbsy,\u0026rdquo; and her next slam would smash me in the groin, rage combined with harmlessness. We rallied half an hour without keeping score. Another trait we shared was hating to lose. Through bouts of ping-pong and Henry James and the church, we kept to one innovation: with rare exceptions, we remained aware of each other\u0026rsquo;s feelings. It took me half my life, more than half, to discover with Jane\u0026rsquo;s guidance that two people could live together and remain kind. When one of us felt grumpy we both shut up until it went away. We did not give in to sarcasm. Once every three years we had a fight\u0026mdash;the way some couples fight three times a day\u0026mdash;and because fights were few the aftermath of a fight was a dreadful gloom. \u0026ldquo;We have done harm,\u0026rdquo; said Jane in a poem after a quarrel. What was that fight about? I wonder if she remembered, a month after writing the poem.\nOf course: the third thing that brought us together, and shone at the center of our lives and our house, was poetry\u0026mdash;both our love for the art and the passion and frustration of trying to write it. When we moved to the farm, away from teaching and Jane\u0026rsquo;s family, we threw ourselves into the life of writing poetry as if we jumped from a bridge and swam to survive. I kept the earliest hours of the day for poetry. Jane worked on poems virtually every day; there were dry spells. In the first years of our marriage, I sometimes feared that she would find the project of poetry intimidating, and withdraw or give up or diminish the intensity of her commitment. I remember talking with her one morning early in New Hampshire, maybe in 1976, when the burden felt too heavy. She talked of her singing with the Michigan Chorale, as if music were something she might turn to. She spoke of drawing as another art she could perform, and showed me an old pencil rendering she had made, acorns I think, meticulous and well-made and nothing more. She was saying, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have to give myself to poetry\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;and I knew enough not to argue.\nHowever, from year to year she gave more of herself to her art. When she studied Keats, she read all his poems, all his letters, the best three or four biographies; then she read and reread the poems and the letters again. No one will find in her poems clear fingerprints of John Keats, but Jane\u0026rsquo;s ear became more luscious with her love for Keats; her lines became more dense, rifts loaded with ore. Coming from a family for whom ambition was dangerous, in which work was best taken lightly, it was not easy for Jane to wager her life on one number. She lived with someone who had made that choice, but also with someone nineteen years older who wrote all day and published frequently. Her first book of poems came out as I published my fifth. I could have been an inhibitor as easily as I was an encourager\u0026mdash;if she had not been brave and stubborn. I watched in gratified pleasure as her poems became better and better. From being promising she became accomplished and professional; then\u0026mdash;with the later poems of The Boat of Quiet Hours, with \u0026ldquo;Twilight: After Haying,\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Briefly It Enters,\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Things,\u0026rdquo; she turned into the extraordinary and permanent poet of Otherwise.\nPeople asked us\u0026mdash;people still ask me\u0026mdash;about competition between us. We never spoke of it, but it had to be there\u0026mdash;and it remained benign. When Jane wrote a poem that dazzled me, I wanted to write a poem that would dazzle her. Boundaries helped. We belonged to different generations. Through Jane I got to be friends with poets of her generation, as she did with my friends born in the 1920s. We avoided situations which would subject us to comparison. During the first years of our marriage, when Jane was just beginning to publish, we were asked several times to read our poems together. The people who asked us knew and respected Jane\u0026rsquo;s poems, but the occasions turned ghastly. Once we were introduced by someone we had just met who was happy to welcome Joan Kenyon. Always someone, generally a male English professor, managed to let us know that it was sweet, that Jane wrote poems too. One head of a department asked her if she felt dwarfed. When Jane was condescended to she was furious, and it was only on these occasions that we felt anything unpleasant between us. Jane decided that we would no longer read together.\nWhen places later asked us both to read, we agreed to come but stipulated that we read separately, maybe a day apart. As she published more widely we were more frequently approached. Late in the 1980s, after reading on different days at one university, we did a joint question-and-answer session with writing students. Three quarters of the questions addressed Jane, not me, and afterwards she said, \u0026ldquo;Perkins, I think we can read together now.\u0026rdquo; So, in our last years together, we did many joint readings. When two poets read on the same program, the first reader is the warm-up band, the second the featured act. We read in fifteen-minute segments, ABAB, and switched A and B positions with each reading. In 1993 we read on a Friday in Trivandrum, at the southern tip of India, and three days later in Hanover, New Hampshire. Exhausted as we were, we remembered who had gone first thousands of miles away.\nThere were days when each of us received word from the same magazine; the same editor had taken a poem by one of us just as he/she rejected the other of us. One of us felt constrained in pleasure. The need for boundaries even extended to style. As Jane\u0026rsquo;s work got better and better\u0026mdash;and readers noticed\u0026mdash;my language and structure departed from its old habits and veered away from the kind of lyric that Jane was writing, toward irony and an apothegmatic style. My diction became more Latinate and polysyllabic, as well as syntactically complex. I was reading Gibbon, learning to use a vocabulary and sentence structure as engines of discrimination. Unconsciously, I was choosing to be as unlike Jane as I could. Still, her poetry influenced and enhanced my own. Her stubborn and unflagging commitment turned its power upon me and exhorted me. My poems got better in this house. When my Old and New Poems came out in 1990, the positive reviews included something like this sentence: \u0026ldquo;Hall began publishing early . . . but it was not until he left his teaching job and returned to the family farm in New Hampshire with his second wife the poet Jane Kenyon that . . .\u0026rdquo; I published Kicking the Leaves in 1978 when Jane published From Room to Room. It was eight years before we published our next books: her The Boat of Quiet Hours, my The Happy Man. (When I told Jane my title her reaction was true Jane: \u0026ldquo;Sounds too depressed.\u0026rdquo;) I had also been working on drafts of The One Day, maybe my best book. Then Jane wrote Let Evening Come, Constance, and the twenty late poems that begin Otherwise. Two years after her death, a review of Jane began with a sentence I had been expecting. It was uttered in respect, without a sneer, and said that for years we had known of Jane Kenyon as Donald Hall\u0026rsquo;s wife but from now on we will know of Donald Hall as Jane Kenyon\u0026rsquo;s husband.\nWe did not show each other early drafts. (It\u0026rsquo;s a bad habit. The comments of another become attached to the words of a poem, steering it or preventing it from following its own way.) But when we had worked over a poem in solitude for a long time, our first reader was the other. I felt anxious about showing Jane new poems, and often invented reasons for delay. Usually, each of us saved up three or four poems before showing them to the other. One day I would say, \u0026ldquo;I left some stuff on your footstool,\u0026rdquo; or Jane would tell me, \u0026ldquo;Perkins, there are some things on your desk.\u0026rdquo; Waiting for a response, each of us already knew some of what the other would say. If ever I repeated a word\u0026mdash;a habit acquired from Yeats\u0026mdash;I knew that Jane would cross it out. Whenever she used verbal auxiliaries she knew I would simplify, and \u0026ldquo;it was raining\u0026rdquo; would become \u0026ldquo;it rained.\u0026rdquo; By and large we ignored the predicted advice, which we had already heard in our heads and dismissed. Jane kept her work clear of dead metaphor, knowing my crankiness on the subject, and she would exult when she found one in my drafts: \u0026ldquo;Perkins! Here\u0026rsquo;s a dead metaphor!\u0026rdquo; These encounters were important but not easy. Sometimes we turned polite with each other: \u0026ldquo;Oh, really! I thought that was the best part . . .\u0026rdquo; (False laugh.) Jane told others\u0026mdash;people questioned us about how we worked together\u0026mdash;that I approached her holding a sheaf of her new poems saying, \u0026ldquo;These are going to be good!\u0026rdquo; to which she would say, \u0026ldquo;Going to be, eh?\u0026rdquo; She told people that she would climb back to her study, carrying the poems covered with my illegible comments, thinking, \u0026ldquo;Perkins just doesn\u0026rsquo;t get it. And then,\u0026rdquo; she would continue, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d do everything he said.\u0026rdquo;\nNeither of us did everything the other said. Reading Otherwise I find words I wanted her to change, and sometimes I still think I was right. But we helped each other greatly. She saved me a thousand gaffes, cut my wordiness and straightened out my syntax. She seldom told me that anything was good. \u0026ldquo;This is almost done,\u0026rdquo; she\u0026rsquo;d say, \u0026ldquo;but you\u0026rsquo;ve got to do this in two lines not three.\u0026rdquo; Or, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve brought this a long way, Perkins\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;without telling me if I had brought it to a good place. Sometimes her praise expressed its own limits. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve taken this as far as the intellect can take it.\u0026rdquo; When she said, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s finished. Don\u0026rsquo;t change a word,\u0026rdquo; I would ask, \u0026ldquo;But is it any good ? Do you like it?\u0026rdquo; I pined for her praise, and seldom got it. I remember one evening in 1992 when we sat in the living room and she read through the manuscript of The Museum of Clear Ideas. Earlier she had seen only a few poems at a time, and she had not been enthusiastic. I watched her dark face as she turned the pages. Finally she looked over at me and tears started from her eyes. \u0026ldquo;Perkins, I don\u0026rsquo;t like it!\u0026rdquo; Tears came to my eyes too, and I said, rapidly, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s okay. That\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u0026rdquo; (That book was anti-Jane in its manner, or most of it was, dependant on syntax and irony, a little like Augustan poetry, more than on images.) When we looked over each other\u0026rsquo;s work, it was essential that we never lie to each other. Even when Jane was depressed, I never praised a poem unless I meant it; I never withheld blame. If either of us had felt that the other was pulling punches, it would have ruined what was so essential to our house.\nWe were each other\u0026rsquo;s readers but we could not be each other\u0026rsquo;s only readers. I mostly consulted friends and editors by mail, so many helpers that I will not try to list them, poets from my generation and poets Jane\u0026rsquo;s age and even younger. Jane worked regularly, the last dozen years of her life, with the poet Joyce Peseroff and the novelist Alice Mattison. The three of them worked wonderfully together, each supplying things that the other lacked. They fought, they laughed, they rewrote and cut and rearranged. Jane would return from a workshop exhausted yet unable to keep away from her desk, working with wild excitement to follow suggestions. The three women were not only being literary critics for each other. Each had grown up knowing that it was not permitted for females to be as aggressive as males, and all were ambitious in their art, and encouraged each other in their ambition. I felt close to Alice and Joyce, my friends as well as Jane\u0026rsquo;s, but I did not stick my nose into their deliberations. If I had tried to, I would have lost a nose. Even when they met at our house, I was careful to stay apart. They met often at Joyce\u0026rsquo;s in Massachusetts, because it was half way between Jane and Alice. They met in New Haven at Alice\u0026rsquo;s. When I was recovering from an operation, and Jane and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be separated, there were workshops at the Lord Jeffrey Inn in Amherst. We four ate together and made pilgrimages to Emily Dickinson\u0026rsquo;s house and grave, but while they worked together I wrote alone in an adjacent room. This three-part friendship was essential to Jane\u0026rsquo;s poetry.\nMeantime we lived in the house of poetry, which was also the house of love and grief; the house of solitude and art; the house of Jane\u0026rsquo;s depression and my cancers and Jane\u0026rsquo;s leukemia. When someone died whom we loved, we went back to the poets of grief and outrage, as far back as Gilgamesh; often I read aloud Henry King\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Exequy,\u0026rdquo; written in the seventeenth century after the death of his young wife. Poetry gives the griever not release from grief but companionship in grief. Poetry embodies the complexities of feeling at their most intense and entangled, and therefore offers (over centuries, or over no time at all) the company of tears. As I sat beside Jane in her pain and weakness I wrote about pain and weakness. Once in a hospital I noticed that the leaves were turning. I realized that I had not noticed that they had come to the trees. It was a year without seasons, a year without punctuation. I began to write \u0026ldquo;Without\u0026rdquo; to embody the sensations of lives under dreary, monotonous assault. After I had drafted it many times I read it aloud to Jane. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it, Perkins,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got it. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\u0026rdquo; Even in this poem written at her mortal bedside there was companionship.\nBibliography References Hall, Donald. 2023. “The Third Thing.” Text/Html. Poetry Magazine.

There are four steps:\nCreate a Task diagram\nAsk the subject matter expert to decompose the task in to steps, or subtasks, into 3-61 steps\n\u0026ldquo;Think about what you do when you perform \u0026lt;task of interest\u0026gt;. Can you break this down into less than six, but more than three steps?\u0026rdquo; (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinEasierMethodExtractingTacitKnowledge2021)\nAsk the subject matter expert to identify the more complex or cognitively demanding steps\n\u0026ldquo;Of the steps you have just identified, which require difficult cognitive skills?

Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation.\u0026rdquo; (Militello and Hutton 1998)\nAsk them to \u0026ldquo;identify major events, including judgements and decisions\u0026rdquo; (Militello and Hutton 1998) and probe each event for \u0026ldquo;situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event\u0026rdquo; (Militello and Hutton 1998)\nAggregate their answers into a simulation interview table. \u0026ldquo;Using the same simulation for interviews with multiple SMEs can provide insight into situations in which more than one action would be acceptable, and alternative assessments of the same situation are plausible.\u0026rdquo; (Militello and Hutton 1998)\nConstruct a Cognitive demands table\nTask diagram The goal when creating a task diagram is to set up the knowledge audit and the simulation interview. You want a big-picture overview of the most cognitively demanding parts of the task, so that you may focus the majority of your time on those parts.\n(Militello and Hutton 1998)\nExample: Task diagram (Militello and Hutton 1998)\nKnowledge audit The knowledge audit identifies ways in which expertise has been used in a domain, and surfaces examples based on the expert\u0026rsquo;s real world experiences. The goal here is to capture the most important aspects of expertise.\nYou start out with a list of basic probes. These probes are drawn from the knowledge categories that most commonly characterise expertise. After a handful of interviews, it should become clear to you which probes produce the most information for that specific subtask; you may then reduce the time you spend on less useful questions. (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinEasierMethodExtractingTacitKnowledge2021)\nThe knowledge audit identifies ways in which expertise is used in a domain and provides examples based on actual experience. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe list of probes is the starting point for conducting this interview. Then, the interviewer asks for specifics about the example in terms of critical cues and strategies of decision making. This is followed by a discussion of potential errors that a novice, less-experienced person might have made in this situation.\n(Militello and Hutton 1998)\nKnowledge audit probes Basic probes:\nPast \u0026amp; Future\nExperts can figure out how a situation developed, and they can think into the future to see where the situation is going. Amongst other things, this can allow experts to head off problems before they develop.\nIs there a time when you walked into the middle of a situation and knew exactly how things got there and where they were headed?\nBig Picture\nNovices may only see bits and pieces. Experts are able to quickly build an understanding of the whole situation \u0026mdash; the Big Picture view. This allows the expert to think about how different elements fit together and affect each other.\nCan you give me an example of what is important about the Big Picture for this task? What are the major elements you have to know and keep track of?\nNoticing\nExperts are able to detect cues and see meaningful patterns that less-experienced personnel may miss altogether.\nHave you had experiences where part of a situation just \u0026lsquo;popped\u0026rsquo; out at you; where you noticed things going on that others didn\u0026rsquo;t catch? What is an example?\nJob Smarts\nExperts learn how to combine procedures and work the task in the most efficient way possible. They don\u0026rsquo;t cut corners, but they don\u0026rsquo;t waste time and resources either.\nWhen you do this task, are there ways of working smart or accomplishing more with less \u0026mdash; that you have found especially useful?\nOpportunities/Improvising\nExperts are comfortable improvising \u0026mdash; seeing what will work in this particular situation; they are able to shift directions to take advantage of opportunities.\nCan you think of an example when you have improvised in this task or noticed an opportunity to do something better?\nSelf-Monitoring\nExperts are aware of their performance; they check how they are doing and make adjustments. Experts notice when their performance is not what it should be (this could be due to stress, fatigue, high workload, etc) and are able to adjust so that the job gets done.\nCan you think of a time when you realised that you would need to change the way you were performing in order to get the job done?\nOptional Probes:\nAnomalies\nNovices don\u0026rsquo;t know what is typical, so they have a hard time identifying what is atypical. Experts can quickly spot unusual events and detect deviations. And, they are able to notice when something that ought to happen, doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nCan you describe an instance when you spotted a deviation from the norm, or knew something was amiss?\nEquipment Difficulties\nEquipment can sometimes mislead. Novices usually believe whatever the equipment tells them; they don\u0026rsquo;t know when to be skeptical.\nHave there been times when the equipment pointed in one direction, but your own judgment told you to do something else? Or when you had to rely on experience to avoid being led astray by the equipment?\n[formatting mine]\n(Militello and Hutton 1998)\nExample: Knowledge audit table Aspects of expertise Cues and strategies Why difficult? Past and future; e.g. Explosions in office strip \u0026mdash; search the office areas rather than source of explosion Material safety data sheets (MSDS) tells you that explosion in area of dangerous chemicals and information about chemicals.

Listen for crying, talking to themselves, victims knocking things over. Noise from own breathing in apparatus, fire noises. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what kinds of sounds to listen for. [formatting mine]\n(Militello and Hutton 1998)\nSimulation interview The simulation interview allows the interviewer to better understand the SME\u0026rsquo;s cognitive processes within the context of an incident. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe simulation interview is based on presentation of a challenging scenario to the SME. The authors recommend that the interviewer retrieves a scenario that already exists for use in this interview. Often, simulations and scenarios exist for training purposes. It may be necessary to adapt or modify the scenario to conform to practical constraints such as time limitations. Developing a new simulation specifically for use in the interview is not a trivial task and is likely to require an upfront CTA in order to gather the foundational information needed to present a challenging situation. The simulation can be in the form of a paper-and-pencil exercise, perhaps using maps or other diagrams. In some settings it may be possible to use video or computer-supported simulations. Surprisingly, in the authors\u0026rsquo; experience, the fidelity of the simulation is not an important issue. The key is that the simulation presents a challenging scenario.\nAfter exposure to the simulation, the SME is asked to identify major events, including judgements and decisions, with a question such as, `As you experience this simulation, imagine you are the (job you are investigating) in the incident. Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation\u0026rsquo;. Each event is probed for situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event (figure 3).\nInformation elicited is recorded in the simulation interview table (table 2). Using the same simulation for interviews with multiple SMEs can provide insight into situations in which more than one action would be acceptable, and alternative assessments of the same situation are plausible. This technique can be used to highlight differing SME perspectives, which is important information for developing training and system design recommendations. The technique can also be used to contrast expert and novice perspectives by conducting interviews with people of differing levels of expertise using the same simulation.\n(Militello and Hutton 1998)\nSimulation interview probes Figure 3.

The product of the task analysis can be used to inform the design of interfaces and training systems. However, CTA is resource intensive and has previously been of limited use to design practitioners. A streamlined method of CTA, Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA), is presented in this paper. ACTA consists of three interview methods that help the practitioner to extract information about the cognitive demands and skills required for a task. ACTA also allows the practitioner to represent this information in a format that will translate more directly into applied products, such as improved training scenarios or interface recommendations. This paper will describe the three methods, an evaluation study conducted to assess the usability and usefulness of the methods, and some directions for future research for making cognitive task analysis accessible to practitioners. ACTA techniques were found to be easy to use, flexible, and to provide clear output. The information and training materials developed based on ACTA interviews were found to be accurate and important for training purposes.\nIntroduction As task analytic techniques have become more sophisticated, focusing on cognitive activities as well as behaviours, they have become less accessible to practitioners. This paper introduces Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA), a set of streamlined cognitive task an alysis tools that have been developed specifically for use by professionals who have not been trained in cognitive psychology, but who do develop ap plications that can benefit from the use of cognitive task analysis.\nApplied cognitive task analysis The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate techniques that would enable instructional designers and systems designers to elicit critical cognitive elements from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The techniques presented here are intended to be complementary; each is designed to get at different aspects of cognitive skill.\nThe first technique, the task diagram interview, provides the interviewer with a broad overview of the task and highlights the difficult cognitive portions of the task to be probed further with in-depth interviews. The second technique, the knowledge audit, surveys the aspects of expertise required for a specific task or subtask. As each aspect of expertise is uncovered, it is probed for concrete examples in the context of the job, cues and strategies used, and why it presents a challenge to inexperienced people. The third technique, the simulation interview, allows the interviewer to probe the cognitive processes of the SMEs within the context of a specific scenario. The use of a simulation or scenario provides job context that is difficult to obtain via the other interview techniques, and therefore allows additional probing around issues such as situation assessment, how situation assessment impacts a course of action, and potential errors that a novice would be likely to make given the same situation. Finally, a cognitive demands table is offered as a means to consolidate and synthesize the data, so that it can be directly applied to a specific project. [formatting mine]\nTask diagram The task diagram elicits a broad overview of the task and identifies the difficult cognitive elements. Although this preliminary interview offers only a surface-level view of the cognitive elements of the task, it enables the interviewer to focus the more in-depth interviews (i.e. the knowledge audit and simulation interviews) so that time and resources can be spent unpacking the most difficult and relevant of those cognitive elements.\nThe subject matter expert is asked to decompose the task into steps or subtasks with a question such as, `Think about what you do when you (task of interest). Can you break this task down into less than six, but more than three steps?\u0026rsquo; The goal is to get the expert to walk through the task in his / her mind, verbalizing major steps. The interviewer limits the SME to between three and six steps, to ensure that time is not wasted delving into minute detail during the surface-level interview. After the steps of the task have been articulated, the SME is asked to identify which of the steps require cognitive skill, with a question such as, `Of the steps you have just identified which require difficult cognitive skills? By cognitive skills I mean judgements, assessments, problem solving ± thinking skills\u0026rsquo;. The resulting diagram (figure 1) serves as a road map for future interviews, providing an overview of the major steps involved in the task and the sequence in which the steps are carried out, as well as which of the steps require the most cognitive skill.\nThe task diagram interview is intended to provide a surface-level look at the task, and does not attempt to unpack the mental model of each SME. The goal is to elicit a very broad overview of the task.\nKnowledge audit The knowledge audit identifies ways in which expertise is used in a domain and provides examples based on actual experience. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe knowledge audit employs a set of probes designed to describe types of domain knowledge or skill and elicit appropriate examples (figure 2). The goal is not simply to find out whether each component is present in the task, but to find out the nature of these skills, specific events where they were required, strategies that have been used, and so forth. The list of probes is the starting point for conducting this interview. Then, the interviewer asks for specifics about the example in terms of critical cues and strategies of decision making. This is followed by a discussion of potential errors that a novice, less-experienced person might have made in this situation.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBasic probes:\nPast \u0026amp; Future\nExperts can figure out how a situation developed, and they can think into the future to see where the situation is going. Amongst other things, this can allow experts to head off problems before they develop.\nIs there a time when you walked into the middle of a situation and knew exactly how things got there and where they were headed?\nBig Picture\nNovices may only see bits and pieces. Experts are able to quickly build an understanding of the whole situation \u0026mdash; the Big Picture view. This allows the expert to think about how different elements fit together and affect each other.\nCan you give me an example of what is important about the Big Picture for this task? What are the major elements you have to know and keep track of?\nNoticing\nExperts are able to detect cues and see meaningful patterns that less-experienced personnel may miss altogether.\nHave you had experiences where part of a situation just \u0026lsquo;popped\u0026rsquo; out at you; where you noticed things going on that others didn\u0026rsquo;t catch? What is an example?\nJob Smarts\nExperts learn how to combine procedures and work the task in the most efficient way possible. They don\u0026rsquo;t cut corners, but they don\u0026rsquo;t waste time and resources either.\nWhen you do this task, are there ways of working smart or accomplishing more with less \u0026mdash; that you have found especially useful?\nOpportunities/Improvising\nExperts are comfortable improvising \u0026mdash; seeing what will work in this particular situation; they are able to shift directions to take advantage of opportunities.\nCan you think of an example when you have improvised in this task or noticed an opportunity to do something better?\nSelf-Monitoring\nExperts are aware of their performance; they check how they are doing and make adjustments. Experts notice when their performance is not what it should be (this could be due to stress, fatigue, high workload, etc) and are able to adjust so that the job gets done.\nCan you think of a time when you realised that you would need to change the way you were performing in order to get the job done?\nOptional Probes:\nAnomalies\nNovices don\u0026rsquo;t know what is typical, so they have a hard time identifying what is atypical. Experts can quickly spot unusual events and detect deviations. And, they are able to notice when something that ought to happen, doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nCan you describe an instance when you spotted a deviation from the norm, or knew something was amiss?\nEquipment Difficulties\nEquipment can sometimes mislead. Novices usually believe whatever the equipment tells them; they don\u0026rsquo;t know when to be skeptical.\nHave there been times when the equipment pointed in one direction, but your own judgment told you to do something else? Or when you had to rely on experience to avoid being led astray by the equipment?\nTable 1. Example of a knowledge audit table.\nAspects of expertise Cues and strategies Why difficult? Past and future; e.g. Explosions in office strip \u0026mdash; search the office areas rather than source of explosion Material safety data sheets (MSDS) tells you that explosion in area of dangerous chemicals and information about chemicals. Start where most likely to find victims and own safety considerations Novice would be trained to start at source and work out. May not look at MSDS, to find potential source of explosion, and account for where people are most likely to be. Big picture; includes source of hazard, potential location of victims, ingress/egress routes, other hazards Senses, communication with others, building owners, MSDS, building pre-plans Novice get tunnel vision, focuses on one thing e.g . victims Noticing; breathing sounds of victims Both you and your partner stop, hold your breath, and listen. Listen for crying, talking to themselves, victims knocking things over. Noise from own breathing in apparatus, fire noises. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what kinds of sounds to listen for. [formatting mine]\nSimulation interview The simulation interview allows the interviewer to better understand the SME\u0026rsquo;s cognitive processes within the context of an incident. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe simulation interview is based on presentation of a challenging scenario to the SME. The authors recommend that the interviewer retrieves a scenario that already exists for use in this interview. Often, simulations and scenarios exist for training purposes. It may be necessary to adapt or modify the scenario to conform to practical constraints such as time limitations. Developing a new simulation specifically for use in the interview is not a trivial task and is likely to require an upfront CTA in order to gather the foundational information needed to present a challenging situation. The simulation can be in the form of a paper-and-pencil exercise, perhaps using maps or other diagrams. In some settings it may be possible to use video or computer-supported simulations. Surprisingly, in the authors\u0026rsquo; experience, the fidelity of the simulation is not an important issue. The key is that the simulation presents a challenging scenario.\nAfter exposure to the simulation, the SME is asked to identify major events, including judgements and decisions, with a question such as, `As you experience this simulation, imagine you are the (job you are investigating) in the incident. Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation\u0026rsquo;. Each event is probed for situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event (figure 3).\nInformation elicited is recorded in the simulation interview table (table 2). Using the same simulation for interviews with multiple SMEs can provide insight into situations in which more than one action would be acceptable, and alternative assessments of the same situation are plausible. This technique can be used to highlight differing SME perspectives, which is important information for developing training and system design recommendations. The technique can also be used to contrast expert and novice perspectives by conducting interviews with people of differing levels of expertise using the same simulation.\nFigure 3. Simulation interview probes\nFor each major event, elicit the following information\nAs the (job you are investigating) in this scenario, what actions, if any, would you take at this point in time? What do you think is going on here? What is your assessment at this point in time? What pieces of information led you to this situation assessment and these actions? What errors would an inexperienced person be likely to make in this situation? Table 2.

We\u0026rsquo;ll say that you know the project pretty well: you can get an A with only moderate effort, and with significant effort you could produce something much better than the usual A-grade paper.\nThe education environment implicitly attempts to convince students that their preferences point ever rightward along this line. Parents and teachers say things like \u0026ldquo;you should put in your best effort,\u0026rdquo; and they heap shame upon people who don\u0026rsquo;t strive to push ever rightward along the quality line.\nPeople generally react to this coercion in one of two ways. The first group (the \u0026ldquo;slackers\u0026rdquo;) rejects the implication that quality=preferences. These are the people who don\u0026rsquo;t care about the class, who complain constantly about the useless pointless work they have to do, who half-ass the assignment and turn in something that either barely passes or fails entirely. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe second group (the \u0026ldquo;tryers\u0026rdquo;) are the ones who accept the premise that quality=preferences, and strive ever rightwards on the quality line. [\u0026hellip;]\nSociety has spent a lot of time conditioning us to think of the tryers as better than the slackers. Being a tryer is a virtue.

Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re there because you want good grades so you can acquire lots of money and power which you will use to fight dragons. Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re there out of a genuine thirst for knowledge. But no matter why you\u0026rsquo;re there, your reason for being there will pick out a single target point on the quality line.

Remove 4 cloves garlic from head and set aside. Place remaining head in the center of a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and season with salt. Wrap tightly with foil and place in an oven-safe cast iron, carbon steel, or stainless steel skillet, then transfer to oven. Roast until garlic is completely tender, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and refrigerate until ready to use the next day.\nCombine flour, water, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. (To account for rising, the bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times the volume of the dough.) Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains.\nCover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are well sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.\nAdd 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil to a 12-inch cast iron skillet or large cake pan. Transfer dough to pan by tipping it out of the bowl in one large blob. Turn dough to coat in oil. Using a flat palm, press dough around skillet, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and sides of pan. Peel roasted garlic cloves and break up large cloves into 2 or 3 pieces each. Scatter roasted garlic evenly over surface of dough, then push down on each clove until it is embedded in a deep well of dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours. After the first hour, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).\nAt the end of the 2 hours, dough should mostly fill skillet, up to its edge. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape. Repeat, moving around dough, until no air bubbles are left underneath and dough is evenly spread around skillet.\nTransfer skillet to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom appears golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 16 to 24 minutes. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan on a burner and cook over medium heat, moving pan around to cook evenly, until bottom of focaccia is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, Make the Garlic Butter: Mince 4 reserved raw cloves of garlic. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil with butter in a small skillet and melt over medium-low heat. Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant and garlic is just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and season with salt.\nWhen focaccia has finished baking, spread garlic butter over top with a spoon. Transfer to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly, slice, and serve. Extra bread should be stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 300°F (150°C) oven for about 10 minutes before serving.\nBibliography References López-Alt, James Kenji. n.d. “Easy Roasted-Garlic Focaccia Recipe.” Serious Eats.

Turner\u0026rsquo;s painting doesn\u0026rsquo;t depict this series of events, however; instead we, the viewer, are put in the position of Regulus himself, the light at the center of the frame pouring out in a deluge that saturates every other aspect of the piece.\nAnd by all accounts, Regulus was barely the same painting before varnishing day.\nThe artist John Gilbert watched Turner work, and wrote breathlessly that he \u0026ldquo;did not look about him, but kept on scumbling a lot of white into his picture - nearly all over it\u0026hellip; the picture was a mass of red and yellow of all varieties. Every object was in this fiery state. He had a large palette, nothing in it but a huge lump of flake-white; he had two or three biggish hog tools to work with, and with these he was driving the white into all the hollows, and every part of the surface…The picture gradually became wonderfully effective, just the effect of brilliant sunlight absorbing everything and throwing a misty haze over every object. Standing sideway of the canvas, I saw that the sun was a lump of white standing out like the boss on a shield\u0026rdquo;.\nEven more entertaining, a closer inspection of Regulus shows that the canvas is significantly torn right at the point of sun\u0026rsquo;s greatest impact and stitched back together by Turner himself, as if the intensity of the light couldn\u0026rsquo;t be contained on such a fragile material.\nTurner\u0026rsquo;s suns were met with a mix of praise, scorn, and general bemusement from critics; my favorite writing about him sounds like warnings to the public; a newspaper in 1837 recommended the paintings be viewed from a safe distance. They said, with an unclear level of humor, that his paintings couldn\u0026rsquo;t be looked at directly without risking eye injury.\nBibliography References Geller, Jacob. 2023. “Staring into the Sun.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSbUPaLTTUg.

The initial basic cylinder is treated as a series of sections, one above the other. The top, and then the upper sections are thinned and pulled upward, using power transferred through stronger, thicker clay of the lower walls that support the weight.\nBegin learning this technique with 4-6 pounds of clay. As you make progress, use greater quantities. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to use a hard clay in the belief that it will stand up better or throw to a greater height than a softer clay. You\u0026rsquo;re learning and should not have to fight to keep the clay centered. Attempting to center hard plastic clay can also cause injury to your hands and wrists. Begin by centering and open- ing the ball of clay, using a style familiar to you. Your initial cylinder needs to be higher than it is wide, and the cavity should be as wide as your hand. When learning, height is more important than width or shape. Keep the bottom flat and make the indentation in the corner as small as possible (1A). The wall must be even in thickness from top to bottom. Compress the base to prevent S cracks. Avoid the usual step of making the next draw upward from the bottom of the pot. This requires a conscious decision. Instead, locate your fingers halfway up the inside of the pot (see 1B) and your right-hand fingers opposite them out- side. Set the wheel speed to half or less. Press your inner fingertips outward to make a groove. Clay has a couple of properties you\u0026rsquo;re about to exploit. First, it\u0026rsquo;s strong where thick, and weak where thin. Second, clay with optimum plasticity for throwing contains sufficient water and needs no extra lubrication to ensure that it slides between your fingers. So, with the wheel spinning at half speed, slowly pull the collar of clay upward (2A), and reduce the wall thickness to half its original thickness. Leave the rim slightly thicker (2B) and let it run between your finger- tips to remove any unevenness. The clay below where you have just thrown is thick, so it won\u0026rsquo;t buckle. The thinner clay at the top is still strong if you haven\u0026rsquo;t allowed water to soak into it from excessive lubrication. The clay you have just thrown is less likely to ripple or buckle because you have reduced leverage by shortening the distance through which your throwing force has acted. Move your hands to the bottom of the pot (3A) and make a groove that undercuts the inside wall. Feel to get the same thickness (3C) as in the first stage. Give firm support on the outside to prevent the wall bulging outward. The clay will start to rise. There should still be sufficient slurry on the clay to provide good lubrication. Move your hands together, allowing the clay to extrude downward as you lift the wall upward with your fingers (3B), keeping the distance between your hands constant. If the clay starts to grab at your fingers, slow the wheel rather than adding more lubricant. Your hands should continue to move upward as one unit until they slide onto the thin- ner upper section (3D). Avoid any temptation to apply a squeeze at this stage. When you started this pull, energy was transmitted only a small distance through the weaker clay where it has been thinned below your fingers. In this figure you will see that the distance your hands move (4A) is small compared to the height of the pot, so leverage is reduced. Above the point where you slide onto the thin clay (4B), there is no need to apply strong force to extrude the clay. You only need a slight amount of pressure that is sufficient to true and collar the shape to the size you need. Again, at the top of this pull, firm and true the rim (4C). At this stage, the thrown cylinder should be at least twice the height of that created on opening the clay. The advantages of working the upper portions of the pot should now become clear. The maximum twisting force is ap- plied each time over only a small propor- tion of the full height of the cylinder; and the weight of clay that has already been thinned is supported by thicker, stronger clay. Furthermore, at no time does the full weight of the pot wall rest on clay that has been thinned except on com- pletion of the final pull from the bottom. This factor becomes extremely impor- tant in the final stages of throwing. You should now be able to double the height of the cylinder and halve its wall thick- ness without changing its width. Though it would be possible to do this with a single pull from the bottom, recall that you\u0026rsquo;re learning a new and unfamiliar pro- cess. To revert to the common throwing style would introduce stresses in the weakest areas, a situation this method of throwing attempts to avoid. Instead, three separate stages are planned: work- ing first from the upper part (5A), then through the central section (5B), and finally thinning the lower part (5C). Make a groove inside the cylinder (5D), then pull the clay up so that the outside of the wall remains concentric (5E). Again, use only the minimum amount of necessary lubrication. Provided you do not use excessive force, clay below the throwing point will not twist, shear, buckle, tear, or collapse. Thick clay below where you\u0026rsquo;re throwing has all the strength needed to transmit the torque of the wheel at slow speed and support the weight of clay above. When you reach the top of the pull, true and compress the rim. Move down to where the second stage of the lift will start and use your inner finger to make a groove (6A) as in the previous step. Firm support out- side from your right-hand knuckle or fingers prevents clay bulging outward. Maintain this firm support as you lift and thin this section (6B). When you reach the thin section (denoted by the dotted line in the illustration at left), relax your finger pressure and let your hands continue their upward movement. You should not thin this section (6C) even more, or there will be no clay to shape, an important consideration later when you\u0026rsquo;re cre- ating new designs. Again, thick, firm clay below (6D) is giving support and transmitting power to the clay above. Now it becomes possible to see the advantages of this alternative meth- od. This becomes clear if you imagine the cylinder in its inverted position, a situation illustrated in skeleton (red dotted line) diagram (7) and the common result of always throwing from the base. Because the wall is very thin at the bottom (7A), that is where the clay is weakest. Yet this is the area of greatest stress when force is applied at the top of the pot (7B), to reduce the thickness of the firmer clay above. In addition, more stress is imposed by the effects of gravity from the mass of thick- er clay located at the top of the cylinder. In contrast, by using this reversed style of throwing, the remaining thick clay collar at the base, which has yet to be thinned and pulled up, is still strong and firm. Making a groove for the next pull up (7C) imposes no strain on the weaker thin clay above it that has already been thrown upward. Take care to keep your forearm vertical as you make this final pull. Wetting your arm with slip pre- vents snagging, should you touch the wall or the rim. When your fingers slide onto the thinner clay (7D), relax the pressure between your inner and outer hands and carry the pull up (7E) to the top with a light touch, then compress and true the rim. Because you are using only the minimum amount of lubrica- tion necessary, water isn\u0026rsquo;t absorbed into the clay, which remains firm and capable of withstanding greater stress coming from torque and gravity. To complete the cylinder, keep the wheel turning slowly while you mop out any water that has collected in the bottom using a sponge on a stick (8A). Use a flat rib (8B) to skim slurry off the outer wall. Trim the base with a slight undercut using a wooden knife tool (8C), and refine the rim (8D) using a chamois. Your cylinder is ready for shaping. If your attempt has been successful, it may be preferable to cut under the base and set the cylinder aside to set up before invert- ing it for drying to finish.

Start by making the feet, which are thrown upside down. Weigh out 6 pounds of clay for a bottomless cylinder. To avoid giving yourself a manicure, hold two sponges at the top of a wooden rib. Keep the rib flat and pull the clay toward you to form a ring. The left hand should be well lubricated and pressing hard on the ring to prevent it from coming up from the bat (1). The outside diameter at the bottom is 12½ inches (32.5 cm); the height is 1 inch (3 cm); and the thickness is 1 inch (3 cm). Pull the wall up and inward to a height of 3 inches (7.5 cm). The inside top diameter should be 7 inches (18 cm) and the wall thickness ½ inch (1.5 cm). Push in the top to form a lip, using a chamois cloth to smooth the rim. Use a flexible stainless-steel rib to scrape the surface until there is very little slurry left on it (2). This strengthens the wall to prevent collapsing during the indenting process. Make sure the surface is perfectly smooth before starting to indent.\nAs the wheel rotates, place a hard stainless-steel rib on the clay to create indents and ridges (3). Place your other hand on the inside, parallel to the rib for support. With a needle tool, pick off any large clay fragments that remain on the ridges. You can experiment with a variety of ribs in different shapes and sizes to vary the indents. I prefer a hard stainless-steel rib as it gives the lines a strong definition. Go over each individual ridge with a small, thin sponge to smooth and round the ridges between the indents. Note: Place the fingers on the sponge so they wrap around each raised line (4).\nTo determine the placement of the feet, divide the circumference of the rim into thirds. At the top of the cylinder, lightly mark each placement of the foot with a pin tool. Place your index finger on one of the marks on the inside of the rim. Without using any pressure, gently slide this finger down in a straight line until it touches the base of the cylinder. With your index finger, apply outward pressure to the wall of the cylinder in a continuous fluid motion while moving on a diagonal upward to the top of the wall, ending at the next spot where a foot position was marked (5). Stretching the cylinder in this manner will create a soft, undulating effect. Complete this process another two times to define all three feet.\nRemove the bat from the wheel and allow the form to firm up just enough (a soft leather hard) to support the manipulation of a controlled collapse. If you let the clay get too dry, the controlled collapse will not work. Return the foot section to the wheel. Place sponges inside the cylinder to provide structural support at the location of each foot. Next, take a wet sponge and apply a downward pressure between the feet, causing the space between them to gently collapse (6). With a wire, cut the piece off the bat and set it aside.\nRepeat the same process for the body that was done for the foot in steps 1–5 with a few exceptions, starting with measurements. Make the height of the form 3½ inches (9 cm), the outside diameter at the bottom 12½ inches (33 cm), and the outside diameter at the top rim 9 inches (23 cm). You can also experiment as to the number of outward stretches to the wall. Note: A good example of variation of the number of outward stretches and variety of the indents is the finished pagoda vessel on page 22. The stretching should end at ½ inch (1.25 cm) from the top to ensure the rim remains level (7).\nThe rim should be ½ inch (1.25 cm) thick. The bottom of the section made for the feet and the bottom of the collar (which will be made next), should also be this same thickness. This is where the main attachment points will be when assembling the form. If you look at images 7, 14, 15, and 16, you see where the feet, body, and collar are put together. The idea is to leave extra thickness where they join so they can be smoothed together without using a coil. If this whole process seems a bit daunting, you can finish off the body with a nice rim for a bowl (see Dancing Series #2 ).\nThe next step is making the collar that will attach to the top of the body. Using 2 pounds of clay, make a bottomless cylinder, with the outside bottom diameter at 9 inches (23 cm). Pull the wall up and inward to a height of 2 inches (5 cm). Set the gallery before you finish pulling up so there is enough clay to support the force of pressing down. The diameter of the rim above the gallery should measure approximately 6¾ inches (17 cm) (8). When measuring for the lid, leave just a bit of wiggle room.\nTo make the lid, use 2½ pounds of clay to throw a shallow bowl. Keep the walls on the thick side so you have enough extra clay to trim it into shape. The base, which will be the top of the lid once it is flipped over and trimmed, should be no smaller than 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter, to ensure the finial will fit on top. To increase the bowl\u0026rsquo;s diameter, lay down the lid by pressing down with the flat side of a fettling knife, while the other hand supports the clay as it goes down (9). When measuring the lid diameter, hold your finger to the edge of the laid-out bowl and make sure your finger is flush with the calipers.\nFor the finial, use 1 pound of clay and throw an elongated solid cone. Make the base diameter 3 inches (7.5 cm) so it fits well on top of the untrimmed lid. Make several indents on the cone, reminiscent of the eaves on a pagoda. The first indent should begin at ½ inch (1 cm) above the base, leaving enough material to provide a secure attachment to the top of the lid. Indent with a variety of ribs, smoothing after each one. Continue shaping the profile of the finial, leaving the last bit for a smooth point (10).\nCover all parts in plastic and leave overnight to equalize in moisture content.\nOpen the clay to the wheelhead, then, keeping the rib flat on the bat and the left hand lubricated, pull the clay toward you to form a ring.\nUsing a flexible stainless-steel rib, scrape the surface until there is very little slurry left on the rib. This strengthens the wall.\nAs the wheel rotates, place a hard stainless-steel rib on the clay. Place your other hand inside, opposite the rib, for support.\nTo prevent sharp edges, go over each individual ridge with a sponge to smooth and round the ridges between the indents.\nFor the feet, use an index finger to stretch the clay on a diagonal from the bottom to the top of the next marker.\nAfter the piece firms up enough to support a controlled collapse, apply a downward pressure between the feet.\nThrow the body as you did the foot. Stop the stretching about ½ inch (1.5 cm) from the top, so you can create a flat rim.\nAfter the collar is thrown, set a gallery for the lid. When measuring for the lid, leave just a bit of wiggle room.\nThrow an upside-down bowl for a lid. Lay it down with the flat side of a fettling knife, while the other hand supports the clay.\nThe finial begins as a solid cone shape. Start at the bottom and indent with a variety of ribs. Smooth after each indent.\n[formatting mine]\nAssembly: Day 2 Uncover the pieces thrown the day before. The ones that are too wet, leave uncovered to dry further. The ones that are leather hard and ready for assembly can be covered back up with plastic. You\u0026rsquo;ll be checking these all day. It is imperative that the pieces are at the same degree of wetness to avoid cracking at the joins.\nBefore starting with the assembly, the base that fits inside of the thrown feet needs to be made. Weigh 2 pounds of clay and roll out a slab about ¼ inch thick. The size will be determined by the circumference measurement taken above the feet later. Include extra length and width on the slab to account for the bevel that will be cut into it. Place the slab between two drywall boards so it dries evenly. Check after 2 hours. The slab should be a very soft leather hard. Remove from the drywall and wrap the whole slab in plastic until it\u0026rsquo;s time to assemble the sections.\nLoosen the feet from the bat. When the feet are dry enough to avoid collapsing, sandwich the feet by placing another bat on top, then flip it over so the feet are now supporting the base. Adjust the feet until they are level.\nCenter a compass between the three feet. Adjust the compass arm so it sits below the rim. Draw a continuous circle above the points of the feet. Next, using the compass, draw a circle with the same diameter on a piece of paper and cut it out. Lay the paper template over the smoothed slab and cut around the paper using a fettling knife held at a 45° angle. Score and apply slip to the beveled edge of both the slab and the circle scribed below the rim of the foot section. Gently drop in the slab, creating the floor of the pot (11). Smooth the join using the outside hand for support as you compress the drop-in floor slab against the wall of the foot section using your fingers (12), followed by a small flexible rubber rib. When finished, the drop-in floor will look like this if you flip the foot section over (13).\nScore and slip the top of the foot section and the bottom of the body section (14). Place the body on the feet (15). Place the bat supporting the form onto a banding wheel to finish the join. Slowly turn the banding wheel while using a sponge to smooth the join and remove any excess clay. Start with the join on the inside first, then go over the outside join with a rib, being sure to press hard. The compression will keep the joins from cracking as they dry. Score and add slip to the bottom of the collar and the top of the body. Place the collar on the body (16) and join. Refine the joined areas for the feet, body, and collar until it is hard to tell where the sections meet (17).\nWhen the finial is a soft leather hard, place it on a foam support. Use a fettling knife to hollow out the inside. The finial should be as soft as possible, but firm enough as to not distort the shape of the eaves. Spray a piece of plastic with water and wrap the finial well. Flip the lid over and center it on the wheel. Center the finial on top of the lid, trace a line around the bottom of it (18), then score and add slip to the bottom of the finial and the attachment area on the top of the lid. Recenter the finial back on the lid, and firmly attach. Using a round loop trimming tool, make the join of the finial and lid look integrated with the rest of the form. Turn the finished lid over when the piece is leather hard. Using a pin tool, poke a hole in the center at the inside of the top to allow air to circulate into the hollow finial.

(e.g. it is transmitted only through selective apprenticeship, or kept within secret societies). It is incredibly time consuming or costly to explicate.

Or it could be that practitioners themselves are not aware that certain parts of their knowledge are absolutely critical to their success, and so are unable to articulate what it is that they really do. In principle, all relational tacit knowledge may be made explicit, with enough time and effort. The key clause in that sentence is \u0026lsquo;enough time and effort\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; for instance, it often takes Naturalistic Decision Making [Naturalistic decision making] researchers weeks or months before they successfully explicate the nature of the expertise they are studying.\nCollins himself has written a fair amount about scientists who were attempting to build a new kind of laser \u0026mdash; the transversely excited atmospheric pressure carbon dioxide laser, or TEA laser. He notes, of that pursuit:\nMy study (\u0026hellip;) showed that the scientists failed if they used only the information published in scientific papers. These papers included those which supplied details as intricate as the cross-section and machining instructions for the electrodes and even the manufacturers\u0026rsquo; part numbers for bought-in items. It showed, however, that only those who spent some time socially interacting with others who had already built a working model could succeed.\nIt seems that the act of building a working TEA laser involves all sorts of tiny details that the original creators did not think to explicate. And even if they did make an effort to do so, Collins is not sure that the results would have been any different \u0026mdash; some of these things were tiny tweaks that everyone in the lab group understood, but nobody had thought of as important knowledge.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s Collins again, on a different group of scientists:\nMy 2001 study of scientists trying to measure the quality factor, or Q, of sapphire, backed up the earlier work by showing that measurements of the quality factor of small sapphire crystals were so hard that only one group of scientists in the world were able to achieve them until a member of the successful Russian group spent considerable time in the laboratory of a second group, in Glasgow, who finally managed it after a week or so of interaction.\nCollins appears to enjoy using the laser example and the sapphire example because the scientists were working from detailed specifications published in peer-reviewed journals \u0026hellip; and they were working in physics and material science respectively \u0026mdash; both of them \u0026lsquo;hard sciences\u0026rsquo;!

A few weeks ago, I learnt of Lia DiBello, an NDM researcher who specialises in the extraction of tacit mental models of business expertise.\nDiBello\u0026rsquo;s findings are extremely compelling. She writes, in The Oxford Handbook of Expertise (a):\nAfter several years using different methods, we noticed that highly talented business performers are very similar to each other. That is, they have decoded the domain of business much like chess masters had decoded chess. This led us to realise that \u0026mdash;as a domain\u0026mdash;business itself is an orderly closed system of relations between principles, and that so-called intuitive experts in business have an implicit grasp of this. If this is the case, it would follow that all highly skilled business experts should recognise each other and share a common mental model of these principles, although they may manifest differently in different industries. Since business has been evolving in recent years, this model would have to be very robust, running deeper than recent societal changes. (emphasis mine)\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI dove into DiBello\u0026rsquo;s publication history [Deep-dive reading]. This turned out to be relatively easy \u0026mdash; I quickly learnt that DiBello has published a relatively small number of papers, especially when compared against the research output of some expertise researchers. Initially, I found this frustrating, but then I realised that she has spent the bulk of the past 20 years consulting for big companies, applying her research to the real world. (During her interview on the NDM podcast (a), she says (54:04) somewhat ruefully, \u0026ldquo;Because of how I wanted to get a lot of data, I ended up selling my soul to big business, and I made a lot of rich people richer. But it was how I got to prove that what we do works.\u0026rdquo;). She spends more time today attempting to adapt her training methods for broader uses, to make them available to businesspeople who might not be able to afford a full consultation. To my mind, this makes her more, not less, believable (a).\nDiBello\u0026rsquo;s main ideas The bulk of her work follows from these three big ideas:\nBusiness expertise consists of a handful of properties: (a) it is team-based \u0026mdash; meaning that business expertise is actually a form of distributed cognition, with expertise spread amongst an executive team; (b) it consists of two things: domain-specific mental models of the business and cognitive agility; and (c) there is a deeper mental model that underpins those domain-specific mental models, which explains how good business people are able to recognise other good business people, even if they are from different industries. She argues that general problem solving ability does not matter so much in business so much as a property she describes as cognitive agility \u0026mdash; which is the ability to update mental models in light of new information. Her primary innovation is an intervention known as the FutureView Profiler. The Profiler is able to evaluate the shared mental models of an executive team: it is able to (a) identify blind spots in the executive team\u0026rsquo;s model of the business, (b) able to evaluate cognitive agility, and (c) able to measure expertise in business primarily because it asks business people to do year-by-year predictions of similar companies within their own industries. I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted the most immediately useful elements of her work above, but I want to note that the ideas sit on top of a few other contributions that are novel from an expertise research perspective:\nDiBello\u0026rsquo;s insight that domain-specific prediction tasks are a useful way to evaluate business skill is a huge contribution to the literature on expertise. She spends a few paragraphs in her 2010 paper [2] discussing why the Profiler works, and why other assessments of business skill do not. (The gist of the argument is that you want to evaluate how a business person\u0026rsquo;s mental models update in response to a dynamic context; you do not want to evaluate what currently exists in their heads). Her company, Workplace Technology Research Inc (WTRI), has spent years implementing company training simulations in virtual worlds. Apart from the obvious technical effort (she explains [3] that they decided to code a full world of their own, on a game engine of their choice, mostly because existing companies they collaborated with kept getting acquired or shut down) \u0026mdash; she has novel insights on the pedagogical effectiveness of using virtual game worlds to teach business simulations. Last, but perhaps most importantly, DiBello argues that business expertise is primarily a matter of organisation. She writes, in the Oxford Handbook: \u0026ldquo;Like experts in other domains, business experts rely not on greater analysis or greater information, but better ways of structuring or organising their knowledge. Further, a business expert differs in the manner in which he or she looks at the business landscape, particularly with regard to what is linked with what and what is important to manipulate.\u0026rdquo; As a result, the bulk of DiBello\u0026rsquo;s training methods aim to do what is called \u0026lsquo;cognitive reorganisation\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; that is, WTRI does not seek to teach business people new concepts about their domain per se, but to instead reorganise existing domain-specific mental models in their heads. The mental model of business In the Oxford Handbook, DiBello writes:\nIn a study funded by the National Science Foundation conducted over four years (NSF Award ENG 9548631) we found that those who show considerable and consistent talent in business have such a mental model, shown in predictable ways of making use of information. Leveraging our relationships with companies and clients, we had unusual personal access to study a large number of highly placed leaders. Doing in-depth studies of talented business leaders who were repeat successes\u0026mdash;even in very challenging markets\u0026mdash;and who had risen to very high positions (such as chairmen of large corporations) and maintained that level of position even as business itself has grown much more complex, we discovered a shared mental model among all of them. [1]\nThat shared mental model is essentially a triad:\nOur research revealed that people who have achieved a high level of business expertise have a deep understanding of the following three core areas: (1) factors involved in effective operations, (2) forces influencing the market, and (3) those driving business finance and economic climates. Consistently successful business leaders have been shown to intuitively understand these areas and their impact on each other, and to pay attention to this fundamental triad in a uniquely dynamic way within a guiding context of business strategy. For example, these experts are able to sense that market conditions change based on environmental indications that others may fail to notice. Further, they foresee the consequences to their business operations and finances, and thus make necessary adjustments proactively. Unlike most business professionals, they are attuned to the early indicators of widespread change. Beyond this, they are expert at keeping the triad in balance, or shifting the balance when external conditions are conducive to do so (e.g., focusing on marketing during favourable economic times). (emphasis added) [2]\nThroughout the paper, DiBello describes the triad using different names. One way of describing it is \u0026lsquo;supply/demand/capital\u0026rsquo;. Another is \u0026rsquo;leadership/strategy/finance\u0026rsquo;. To summarise:\nSupply, or leadership \u0026mdash; These represent operational concerns related to the business, what DiBello calls \u0026lsquo;factors involved in effective operations\u0026rsquo;. Naturally, how the operational concerns are expressed depends on the industry (e.g. you have to be good at product development (a) if you\u0026rsquo;re in consumer software, and you must have competent manufacturing if you\u0026rsquo;re Chobani (a)). Think expansively when it comes to each category of the triad \u0026mdash; this category includes things like org design, incentive structures, execution cadence, and even the ability to get things done within the company (e.g. execs must have good mental models of the org and its people, and the ability to push through plans given internal politics). Demand, or strategy \u0026mdash; These represent the exec\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the market, what DiBello calls \u0026lsquo;forces influencing the market\u0026rsquo;. Of course, market dynamics is a very broad category, and includes everything from market shape, competitive analysis, positioning, changing consumer demand, and the \u0026lsquo;path to power\u0026rsquo; that we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about in our discussion (a) of 7 Powers (a). Capital, or finance \u0026mdash; At the basic level this represents the exec\u0026rsquo;s understanding of basic financial concepts like cash flow lockup (a), return on invested capital, margins, and their relationship with the other two categories (what DiBello calls \u0026lsquo;factors driving business finance and economic climates\u0026rsquo;). The factors here may be equally expansive \u0026mdash; depending on the business, the capital leg of the triad may include expertise with raising capital (e.g. equity financing, debt) or the ability to understand the implications of changes in the capital environment (e.g. John Malone was amongst the first in the cable industry to take advantage of junk bonds in order to finance expansion (a); a more contemporary example might be startup founders who understand how to manipulate extremely liquid private markets to their advantage). As DiBello mentions, the key property of business expertise is in understanding how a change in one leg of the triad affects the other two legs, at least within the context of one\u0026rsquo;s specific industry. Experts are able to notice cues in the environment long before novices are able to, and are then able to forward-simulate what must be done to the other two legs of the triad. So, for example, if there is a change in the capital environment, an expert businessperson might ask how that affects competition (this is the market \u0026mdash; the demand leg of the triad). And they might immediately ask what changes the company must make in response to those market shifts? (This is the supply leg of the triad).\nThis mental model of business is incredibly high-level, but it tells us a lot.\nFor instance, it tells us that expertise may be evaluated according to the facility an exec has with each of the three categories. DiBello writes:\nIn contrast, competent managers (one level down from experts) tend to be very talented in only one or two of these areas; however, they often do not understand the dynamics between these areas as well as the \u0026ldquo;superstars\u0026rdquo; do. Competent managers are likely to be very successful when larger market or economic trends are favourable to their specific skills. (emphasis added) [2]\nThe implication is that if you want to get really good at business, you should systematically acquire skills in each of the three categories, specific to your particular business, and then \u0026mdash; more importantly \u0026mdash; grok the relationships between the three categories.\nIt also explains another observation that DiBello makes:\nExperts in the same domain easily identify each other. Even if they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with another expert\u0026rsquo;s choices, they easily recognise that they share a common perceptual experience within their area of expertise. [2]\nWith the triad model, we may begin to understand how an experienced businessperson is able to recognise another experienced businessperson from a different industry, despite having no idea of the specifics of the other expert\u0026rsquo;s business or market. The answer to this puzzle is that they are able to recognise the intuitive facility with which the other person reasons about supply, demand, and capital in their own businesses! When I read DiBello\u0026rsquo;s articulation of the model, I thought back to certain businesspeople who have told me that they can tell if someone \u0026lsquo;gets it\u0026rsquo;, even if they can\u0026rsquo;t articulate how; what I now think is happening is that their brains must be attuned to the existence of a triad in the other person\u0026rsquo;s head.\nDo I buy this model of business expertise? Yes, I do. Nearly everything I know about business lines up with the model. To my mind, this explains a handful of unrelated phenomena that I\u0026rsquo;ve long puzzled over. For instance:\nWhy are fresh MBA grads unable to grok the implications of, say, cash flow in a given business, despite learning it in their courses? The answer is obvious: they have yet to internalise the relationships between a) market conditions and b) operational realities with c) the financial concepts they learnt in school. Every business is a system, and developing intuition for a system requires you to watch that system in action. Business students who have no real world experience of a business do not usually have such a mental model. DiBello writes, as part of a consulting engagement: \u0026lsquo;As a process check, we administered the same instrument to an equal of number of business-knowledgeable controls (BS or MBA business students who were not yet functioning managers or consultants and had not ever actually run a company of any size). Their performance was much lower. This, too, was an expected result.\u0026rsquo; [2] How many different ways are there to build Power (a) in business? I used to think that companies with better products would win, and then I believed that companies with better distribution would win, and then I ran a business for awhile and realised that businesses have won from differentiated product or differentiated distribution or differentiated access to capital; the possibilities were more varied than I had originally imagined. With the triad, it\u0026rsquo;s clearer to me that temporary competitive advantage may emerge from any of the three categories: you could gain a temporary edge from operational excellence (supply/leadership), or from exploiting some market opportunity (through product innovation or repositioning into a new category \u0026mdash; this is demand/strategy), or even from exploiting some change in the capital environment that others in your industry do not realise exists (e.g. Malone with debt-funded, tax-sheltered expansion \u0026mdash; this is capital/finance). Buffett\u0026rsquo;s quote \u0026ldquo;I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor\u0026rdquo; makes more sense when seen through the lens of the triad \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s likely that exposure to equity investing or actual business operations would shore up one or more of the three categories. As a trivial example, a businessperson without a competent understanding of capital markets is missing one leg of the triad; an investor without a sufficiently realistic understanding of business operations (supply) is missing another. Everything in An MBA for Business Operators (a) may be organised neatly into one of these three categories. In fact, if you look at Permanent Equity\u0026rsquo;s checklist through the lens of the triad, you\u0026rsquo;d realise that it is a mix of supply and capital considerations \u0026hellip; but leaves out demand. This makes sense \u0026mdash; to a private equity fund like Permanent Equity, the demand/strategy side of things is the bit that is most specific to the individual business, and cannot be generalised. Can management consultants or former VCs become good business operators? With the triad in mind, we can be more specific about what must happen: management consultants are likely better equipped in the demand leg of the triad, with some understanding of the finance leg; VCs are better equipped in the finance leg, and somewhat skilled in the demand leg. How well they do is how quickly they level up on the supply leg of the triad, and how well they internalise the relationships between all three. To reiterate the most important point again: DiBello\u0026rsquo;s explication of the triad mental model tells us that it is the relationships between the three that we need to pay attention to; expertise in each leg of the triad is more commonplace when we rise through the stages of business ability.\nCreate node for this triad Cognitive agility DiBello also points out business expertise is made up of one other quality \u0026mdash; something she calls cognitive agility:\nGiven the volatility of markets and the complexity of team decision making in large organisations, we need not be as concerned with the general cognitive ability of today\u0026rsquo;s executive so much as his or her domain-specific expertise and cognitive agility, which is often associated with the kind of intuitive expertise developed through experience. Cognitive agility is what allows executives to rapidly respond to changing situations and revise guiding mental models to meet performance demands. (emphasis added) In sum, these insights require us to shift away from thinking of the cognitive ability of business leaders as fixed and static, and instead to focus on the way in which expertise evolves over time in response to dynamic environments. It also requires us to discard attempts to locate decision-making expertise as a fixed capacity that resides within the individual decision maker. [2]\nBuilding on theories of emergence, adaptation, and flexibility from complexity science and NDM, we use the term cognitive agility to refer to the extent to which an individual revises his or her evaluation of a situation in response to data indicating that conditions have changed. The converse is cognitive rigidity, where the person is impervious to new data, being dominated by a rigid framework or paradigm that acts to filter out new, possibly relevant, information, creating blind spots. [2]\nWhen I read this section of DiBello\u0026rsquo;s 2010 paper, my eyes basically popped out of my head.\nFor several years now, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to talk about the limits of frameworks, as experienced from the perspective of a business operator. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that when a market changes, or when you\u0026rsquo;re operating in a local environment, no framework can fully capture everything that you\u0026rsquo;re seeing as you brush against reality. I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to capture this idea by writing blog posts such as Reality Without Frameworks (a), and How First Principle Thinking Fails (a) and Good Synthesis is the Start of Good Sensemaking (a). More importantly, I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to articulate DiBello\u0026rsquo;s notion of cognitive rigidity, with a trait I invented that I named \u0026lsquo;Dismissively Stubborn (a)\u0026rsquo;. I wrote that piece to explain the type of people I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt to avoid in startup environments.\nBut it turns out that DiBello had thought of this, and more, a full decade before I did. I was also surprised \u0026mdash; and delighted! \u0026mdash; to learn that senior business leaders have thought about this particular aspect of business expertise:\n(We present) a case in which we used the Profiler to assess the senior management team of a medical device company. Our relationship with the company began when the chairman and acting CEO asked us to evaluate his senior staff for succession planning purposes. In particular, he wished to decide who, among the division presidents, would succeed him as the CEO. At the time, the company was growing very rapidly. During the four months we worked with the company between 2005 and 2006, we saw them grow from $300 million to $400 million. A pending acquisition was intended to increase the company\u0026rsquo;s size to $600 million by 2008.\nThe CEO of the company was aware that there is a qualitative difference between competent managers, who do very well in interviews or on personality tests, and experts, who can perform under challenging conditions. He wanted to protect himself from (mere) competence at a time when his industry was in a high growth phase. He was afraid that a favourable market might be masking a lack of skill\u0026mdash;and cognitive agility in particular\u0026mdash;among his senior staff. (emphasis added).\nThe FutureView Profiler In their 2010 paper, DiBello, Lehmann and Missildine laid out the requirements of a good instrument to assess business expertise:\nWe believe that an instrument that effectively assesses business expertise must (1) be able to draw on the intuitive expertise of organisational members; (2) tap into the specific mental models individuals use to approach problems, rather than basic problem solving or generalised decision making skills; (3) locate individuals within the distributed cognition of an organisation, that is, specify the individual\u0026rsquo;s role in the organisation; (4) be able to identify strengths and blind spots of the organisation\u0026rsquo;s transactive memory system and, in so doing, highlight dimensions of expertise that contribute to high-level decision making; and lastly, (5) measure not only cognitive ability, but also cognitive agility, that is, the capacity to rapidly revise one\u0026rsquo;s mental model in the face of dynamic feedback.\nThe Profiler requires the user (1) to examine and analyse the same material used by actual experts (e.g., annual reports, 10K\u0026rsquo;s, analyst\u0026rsquo;s reports, etc., from actual companies) to make business decisions, (2) to make predictions about the company with respect to a number of domains (e.g., revenues), and (3) to judge various aspects of the company (e.g., evaluate the management team).\nSpecifically, the Profiler asks users to answer several questions about the company to predict how its finances will develop over the next five years. Users\u0026rsquo; answers are evaluated in terms of Dreyfus\u0026rsquo;s five-stage model of expertise (a) to determine their business acumen and level of expertise within the domain of business strategy. The Profiler also helps us identify blind spots in users\u0026rsquo; thinking; that is, we can discern areas where users seem to miss aspects critical to the company\u0026rsquo;s performance. Moreover, for each prediction or judgment users must indicate the specific materials they relied on, such as discrepancies in annual report statements or the general state of the company\u0026rsquo;s finances. This aspect of the Profiler taps into the heuristics that are guiding users\u0026rsquo; decision making. [2]\nHow are users evaluated? DiBello et al note that the triad (the extracted mental model of business) isn\u0026rsquo;t directly addressed in the Profiler itself \u0026mdash; even though it informs the design of the assessment:\nThese three core areas are not directly addressed in the questions we ask in the Profiler. Rather, an individual\u0026rsquo;s answers are rated and compared to those of the ideal expert. The questions are based on tangible outcomes and concern the company\u0026rsquo;s performance. The questions ask users to evaluate their company with respect to its strategy, leadership, and finances. These are areas that senior executives would be expected to make valid predictions about and are good ways to reveal their underlying business expertise. For example, a question about finances would be: As the senior manager for the business, which aspect of financial performance most urgently requires your attention? This question would then be followed by a series of options, such as \u0026ldquo;cost of goods sold,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;fixed assets,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;receivables,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;R\u0026amp;D.\u0026rdquo; To answer this question\u0026mdash;that is, to know what is troubling or of concern in the total context of the company at that time\u0026mdash;the user must understand operations, finance, and market trends. Answer options reflect levels of expertise, 1 through 5, corresponding to the five stages in the Dreyfus model. The \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answer is empirically determined. Because these are actual cases, the outcomes are known and the root causes of problems have been identified.\nIn addition to these Dreyfus questions tapping their business expertise, users are asked to provide three predictions that refer to quantitative outcomes in the company\u0026rsquo;s performance. These questions can vary slightly, as the instrument is customised according to a company\u0026rsquo;s needs; however, they will ask about issues, such as profits and revenues, that are indicative of how well a user can synthesise information about the company to predict real-world outcomes. For example, we may ask: What is your prediction of the company\u0026rsquo;s profits for the next 12 months? Users then indicate their answers along a 5-point Likert scale whose points are labelled appropriately, for instance, in the preceding example, options may range from \u0026ldquo;down 20% or greater\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;up 20% or greater.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter this initial set of questions, DiBello steps forward the simulation and presents the results of their first year of predictions. This is the primary way that they are able to assess cognitive agility:\nUsers then go on to Year 2. After reading through the Year 2 materials, they are able to see whether or not their predictions were validated by the company\u0026rsquo;s performance. In other words, they receive feedback as to the accuracy of the previous year\u0026rsquo;s predictions. They repeat this exercise for five years of material, making predictions and getting feedback as to whether or not their predictions have been validated. This iterative process taps into users\u0026rsquo; cognitive agility, allowing us to assess the degree to which users are able to revise their thinking in the face of feedback about company performance and their own predictions. Cognitively agile individuals learn from their inaccurate predictions or judgments and improve as they go along. (emphasis added)\nFurthermore, we can see persistent blind spots that may exist and occur consistently across all five years. Thus, the Profiler can provide windows into the acumen, blind spots, mental models, and agility with which users approach complex decision making for a real company. It is important to keep in mind that all of the data provided are from real companies. We do not determine the outcomes, as they are taken from actual annual reports and actual finances over a given period of time.\nIn addition to evaluating users\u0026rsquo; direct responses to the Dreyfus and Likert questions, we also ask users to point to sections of the material they reviewed (including statements in the annual reports and financial summaries) that informed their decision on a particular question. For example, the annual report might mention a recent acquisition. This may reflect a strategic turning point for the company. As such, after users respond to the question on strategy, they must indicate what sections of the material influenced their decision. Users are allowed to choose up to five reasons for their decision. In this case, users should be aware that the recent acquisition plays a major role in the company\u0026rsquo;s strategy going forward, even if this is not immediately obvious. As such, when users answer this particular strategy question, they should be pointing to the acquisition as a basis for their decision. This not only allows us to evaluate the expertise and accuracy of their responses, but also gives us a window into the kinds of information they use to approach the decision-making process. Furthermore, this aspect of the Profiler allows us to determine whether users are utilising information based on the three core areas listed above: supply, demand, and finance. Specifically, we can see whether users approach the questions in an expert manner by evaluating the degree to which they are paying attention to these core areas as they make decisions.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI believe DiBello when she says that the Profiler is able to detect blindspots in an exec team, that it is able to evaluate cognitive agility, and that you may use it to assess the expertise of business decision makers. I\u0026rsquo;m just not sure how this may be used, if one isn\u0026rsquo;t able to afford DiBello\u0026rsquo;s services.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chinExtractedTacitMentalModelBusinessExpertise2021 Backlinks Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/731b4023-79ea-4671-9de9-2079008f14df/","summary":"Cedric Chin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinExtractedTacitMentalModelBusinessExpertise2021)\nSummary Thoughts Notes it\u0026rsquo;s nearly always more fruitful to mine the literature for already-extracted mental models of expertise.

The paper\u0026rsquo;s contribution was a set of four techniques that are much easier to use than CDM (and other related methodologies), and yet powerful enough for instructional designers or interface designers to extract tacit mental models of expertise from the heads of subject matter experts for their use. The work was funded by the Navy Personnel Research and Development Centre and lasted two years; the authors tested the usability of these new methods by teaching them to two groups of graduate students, before letting them loose to interview two sets of experts: fireground commanders on one end, and naval electronic warfare specialists on the other. These graduate students were then asked to modify existing training programs for both domains, after which those modifications were evaluated by expert instructors in the field.\nMilitello and Hutton\u0026rsquo;s reasoning went something like this: if ACTA was easy enough for random graduate students to use, and if it resulted in significant improvements to the training programs in both domains, then the methods would be even more effective when put in the hands of domain-specific course creators and interface designers. The authors knew that ACTA wasn\u0026rsquo;t as accurate or as powerful as earlier research methods (like CDM), but they thought that the simplicity of their technique was a worthwhile tradeoff.\nIn the years since they first published the paper, they\u0026rsquo;ve largely been proven right.\nThe four techniques of Applied Cognitive Task Analysis See Applied cognitive task analysis.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chinEasierMethodExtractingTacitKnowledge2021 Backlinks Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/112cd568-012c-4eea-b902-53f44907b098/","summary":"Cedric Chin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinEasierMethodExtractingTacitKnowledge2021)\nSummary See Applied cognitive task analysis.\nThoughts This article is a paraphrasing of Laura Militello and Robert Hutton | Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA): A Practitioner\u0026rsquo;s Toolkit for Understanding Cognitive Task Demands without additional insight.\nNotes While RPD describes what expert intuition is, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really help you extract that intuition for yourself.

Seek out a combination of instructional and videos where an expert is doing the thing you\u0026rsquo;re learning.\nThoughts Notes A couple months ago, Samo Burja wrote an essay on Medium titled The Youtube Revolution in Knowledge Transfer (a), a piece that I loved and linked to in issue 50 (a) of the Commonplace newsletter. Burja observed the following things:\nFirst, YouTube is now a thing. Second, quality digital cameras have become cheap enough for mass use. This in turn means that everyone can start producing YouTube-worthy content, and have those videos be discoverable, because \u0026mdash; hey! \u0026mdash; YouTube is now a thing. Three, this also means that people with expertise in thing X can now film themselves doing thing X, and clued-in practitioners can watch these experts do thing X and become really good themselves. Burja then posits that we\u0026rsquo;ll see an explosion of tacit skill transfer over the next decade, correlated with the rise of YouTube use, because certain kinds of human expertise may only really be taught through emulation, not through instruction alone. YouTube use in Judo What Oon is more interested in is analysis of competition footage. I asked him to explain how he used video for this purpose, and he did (a):\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you want to learn how a particular player does a particular technique. Here are some best practices:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just watch just one or two examples of that player doing that technique. Watch multiple examples and try to identify trends or things that that player does in setting up the throw. Take for example, Takato\u0026rsquo;s unique style of ouchi-gari. If you watch enough of them, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice he only does this technique under very specific circumstances (against left-handers who are trying to push his head down). If you notice that, try to understand the reason why. Pay particular attention to grips. How does he grip whenever he wants to do this technique. You will notice a familiar pattern to the gripping. Again, try to understand why. There will be times when the technique fails. Watch those as well and try to understand what went wrong. What was different about this attempt that caused it to fail? Doing this will allow you to isolate the key success factors. Try to look out for variations. Sometimes those differences are very subtle but they are significant. Understanding the variations (when they are used and why the variation are necessary) will give you a better grasp of the technique. It is usually helpful to watch the technique in slow motion. If there is no slow motion replay of the clip available, you may have to download the clip and slow-mo it yourself using a simple video editing program. When I was a student there was no digital videos yet, only VHS cassettes, and I had to use two VCR machines to make slow motion loops of Koga\u0026rsquo;s throws just so I could study them properly! In a separate interview with US Olympic silver medallist Travis Stevens, Oon asks about video, and Stevens answers (a):\nThere is a lot the cadets can do at home to prepare them for future success. Like learning how to break down a fight when watching videos, taking notes on training sessions (emphasis mine), journaling, etc. Winning at judo isn\u0026rsquo;t just about hard work. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more that goes into it than that, like analysis, mental training and so on.\nWhy study competition footage, and not just instructionals? The answer falls out of everything we\u0026rsquo;ve explored in our previous posts on tacit knowledge. Expertise is difficult to explicate, and embodied knowledge can only loosely be captured through language. There usually isn\u0026rsquo;t much of an overlap between the greatest practitioners and the greatest teachers in any given domain.\nSo the solution here is to do what Oon figured out all those years ago: don\u0026rsquo;t wait for someone to come along and explain what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Don\u0026rsquo;t rely on instructionals alone. Look at actual experts doing the actual thing. In the context of Judo, this means developing the meta-skill of watching competition video yourself, in order to break a competitor\u0026rsquo;s technique down into its constituent parts. You try to figure out why it\u0026rsquo;s so effective; later, in the dojo, you attempt to replicate it by copying.\nIn fact, as we\u0026rsquo;ll soon see: this principle is generalisable. When you want to learn a skill on YouTube, you should spend a little bit of time watching instructionals, but then spend the rest of it watching experts doing the actual thing. The former is by definition explicit; the latter allows you to capture what is tacit.\nProgramming In fact, there\u0026rsquo;s a good rule of thumb here that I think is worth keeping in mind: if something can fit into the length of a typical programming conference talk, the odds are good that the aforementioned thing is easily explicable. You get the sense that Hickey\u0026rsquo;s talk could not fit into the length of a conference keynote; if you gave him more time, he could go on.\nYou get this feeling because Hickey is trying to communicate something deeply tacit: a principle that he has imbued into all the projects he\u0026rsquo;s worked on from Clojure to Datomic. And indeed, the more common programming conf talks tend not be like Hickey\u0026rsquo;s; they tend to be about easily explicable topics like \u0026lsquo;how to use cool new feature in programming language X\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;how to do technique Z in framework Y\u0026rsquo;; you\u0026rsquo;re not likely to get higher level things like \u0026ldquo;how do I structure a program to thread the thin line between too much abstraction and too little?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;how do I evaluate the risks of my client being an idiot, which means we\u0026rsquo;ll have to redesign a whole subsystem a month from now?\u0026rdquo; That sort of thing is tacit, you pick it up while on the job, working alongside more experienced people.\nSo if conference talks and lectures are the programming equivalent of Judo instructionals, what is the equivalent of analysing competition videos? The answer, of course, is coding livestreams.\nWrapping up In fact, I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried this yet, but I want to know if Oon Yeoh\u0026rsquo;s principles for analysing Judo video generalises to every other domain of tacit knowledge. If we take his list and remove the Judo-specific references, we get:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just watch one or two examples of the expert doing a technique. Gather multiple examples and try to identify trends or commonalities in the usage of their technique. When you notice such commonalities, try and understand why those commonalities exist. Pay particular attention to context. What happens before or after application of the technique? There will be times when the technique fails. Watch those as well and try to understand what went wrong. Try and look out for variations. These variations represent changes in the action script associated with the prototype in the expert\u0026rsquo;s head. Sometimes these differences are very subtle, but they are significant. Understanding the variations will give you a better grasp of the technique. It is usually helpful to watch the technique in slow motion. Download the clip and slo-mo it yourself using a free video editing program.

However, you would need to take extra care to ensure the learner is training on what you want them to train on. That is, they may get a card correct because it\u0026rsquo;s the only video with a little watermark in the corner and what they\u0026rsquo;ve learned is \u0026ldquo;the answer for the watermark video is X\u0026rdquo; and not what you wanted them to learn (e.g. \u0026ldquo;This pitch is a fastball and I can tell from the pitcher\u0026rsquo;s stance\u0026rdquo;). Notes A natural response to that post is … \u0026ldquo;ok, so after you extract that tacit knowledge — now what?\u0026rdquo; This is an understandable reaction, because the next step after doing all that skill extraction is to use it to learn — to develop a training program for yourself or for others. The main problem with this is that good pedagogy is difficult to do. And, as it happens, I\u0026rsquo;ve not spent any time talking about how Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) researchers turn their insights into actual training programs.\nWhy? Well, this is simple: I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a good, generalised resource in the NDM literature on how they do so. What I have found is a place in the NDM world to dig; this post is to tell you all about it.\nIED defeat One of the big findings that came out of that CTA (Cognitive Task Analysis) was that the Marines who were really doing a great job at being able to recognise a danger zone in advance were the ones who were thinking like the adversary. It sounds like a pretty simple thing, like no kidding of course they were able to put themselves in the adversary\u0026rsquo;s shoes, but we thought this is something that young Marines, the individuals who were deploying for the first time, don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do. They\u0026rsquo;ve never had the ability — outside a training environment, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something that\u0026rsquo;s really been taught in training, at least not in a standard way — they\u0026rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to think from the other guy\u0026rsquo;s perspective. So we used the VBS technology — we teamed with Bohemia Interactive — and we built out a module in VBS where the Marines were role-playing the adversaries, and they were responsible for emplacing IEDs in the environment.\nSo we were essentially putting them in a position where they had to think through how they were going to be effective in placing an IED. Whether they were going to use a cellphone detonator, or … with another sort of IED, they had to think through \u0026lsquo;When is the blue force convoy going to come through? What is the time of day right now? How can I disguise it? Where would be a good ambush zone?\u0026rsquo; All of those kinds of considerations that are happening in the real world.\n(Naturalistic Decision Making 2020)\nTennis serve detection I was working as a video coordinator with a big time football team, and we did video analysis for coaches. And I just felt that more that can be done for player training by putting video and data together [\u0026hellip;]\n(…) but how are you going to systematically train it — how can you get more people over the bar faster? And the way you study it in the labs, is with these occlusion techniques, in particular, temporal occlusion, it cuts off in time. Presented by video.\nSo with a cricket baller, here\u0026rsquo;s the run-up, here\u0026rsquo;s the ball out of hand, boom, cuts to black. And the research subject has to say, well, was that an in-spinner, or whatever category it is, so it\u0026rsquo;s a categorisation task, and it\u0026rsquo;s a prediction task — is it going to hit the wicket, and if it\u0026rsquo;s baseball, is it a ball or a strike? So categorisation and prediction. So now we\u0026rsquo;re starting to really kind of narrow it down. You can say that the macro-cognitive skill we\u0026rsquo;re after is anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, how do you train anticipation?\u0026rdquo; (And people would say): \u0026ldquo;Well, you can\u0026rsquo;t train anticipation, that comes from experience.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, ok. Fine. What is the experience giving you? So we can reduce that back to, ok, it\u0026rsquo;s some pre-event cues and then it\u0026rsquo;s prediction. Ok — we can test prediction, and we can train prediction. So let\u0026rsquo;s take something like anticipation which is the quality that we\u0026rsquo;re after, and let\u0026rsquo;s try to operationalise it in some way that we can train, which is prediction.\nSo the thing was to take the video occlusion method that they used for testing, and turned it into a training program.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThis really started in the early 80s in Australia, with a focus on cricket and tennis. This is the tennis serve return. So you\u0026rsquo;ve got video of a server, that\u0026rsquo;s recorded more or less from the point of view of a tennis receiver. So the server tosses the ball, racket comes through, and then cut to black. And you have to say what kind of serve is that?\nNow that cut to black might be right after ball contact, as you see the ball coming off the strings of the racket, or right before ball contact, or right in it. So they cut it at these different places in here, and this is an expert-novice research paradigm, so they have advanced tennis players and less skilled tennis players (come in to be tested), and where does their performance diverge?\nSo for instance in that one we find that if they see even one frame of video — that\u0026rsquo;s the sharpest knife we have here — you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with about 33 milliseconds in there … if they see two of those (frames) coming off (the strings of the racket), so you\u0026rsquo;ve got 67 milliseconds, still a very short period of time, then the experts and the novices can pretty much say what type of serve that was — that was a kick serve, that was a flat serve, or that was a slice serve. Now you cut back to where you can only see a little bit of ball flight … well, their performance both goes down a bit, but the expert not as much. Now we cut to black before the racket hits the ball. And the experts are still able to say what type of serve that is — they haven\u0026rsquo;t even seen the racket hit the ball, and they can tell you 85% of the time whether it\u0026rsquo;s a kick, a flat, or a slice serve. And they can even predict backhand or forehand side on the return. And at that point the novices performance pretty much drops off. Now if we cut it back a little bit further, they\u0026rsquo;re both down to random (prediction).\nSo now we\u0026rsquo;ve defined our window of expert advantage. From 50 milliseconds before contact, to 50 milliseconds after contact. There\u0026rsquo;s a 100 millisecond window in there when the experts have a distinct advantage over the non-experts. So that\u0026rsquo;s the research finding.\nThen if we repurpose that as a training technique, we say \u0026ldquo;ok, here\u0026rsquo;s the beginning of the window, you should be able to do that, everyone should be able to (detect the serve)\u0026rdquo;, and then we start cutting it back and you see less and less and less, until you, as a developing tennis player, are able to, like the experts, at 85%, identify the serve 50 milliseconds before the contact.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe experts can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily see what they\u0026rsquo;re seeing — they almost put it in the \u0026lsquo;ESP category\u0026rsquo;, like with the firefighters in (Gary) Klein\u0026rsquo;s story (in Sources of Power). And if you press them enough, they\u0026rsquo;ll start making stuff up. The way that experts do, because they want to give you an answer. So you really need to start ascertaining where that is.\nAnd so this is where you can bring in another occlusion technique, which is spatial occlusion. We know we have a window in time where that expert is picking up some kind of cues. It\u0026rsquo;s not ESP, so we know they\u0026rsquo;re picking up some kind of cues (but) we don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are. So what happens if we mask out the racket?\nWell, as it turns out, we can mask out the racket, and the novice\u0026rsquo;s performance will just fall off the table, and it will hardly affect the expert\u0026rsquo;s performance at all. So that tells us that they aren\u0026rsquo;t getting their cues from the racket. But if we mask out the lower half (of the server\u0026rsquo;s body) now, the experts ability to identify that serve when it\u0026rsquo;s cut off really goes down. So that tells us that somewhere in that lower half, they\u0026rsquo;re picking up very early cues, so there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of time to help you make that — what seems like an instantaneous reaction. And you can break it down enough that you realise that if someone is hitting a kick serve, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be a little deeper in their knee bend, their ball toss is going to be behind their head, if it\u0026rsquo;s a slice, the ball toss will be a little to the side. Some of those are known coaching things — the ball toss, for instance.\nAnd you see the reverse of it. For instance, in Pete Sampras\u0026rsquo;s biography, he talks about how — when he was 12 years old, he would toss the ball into the air, and his coach would call out the type of serve to hit from there. So he would have to learn to hit kick, flat, or slice from the same ball toss. And so later, when he played in the US Open against Agassi, considered the best returner of the time, Agassi said that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t read Pete\u0026rsquo;s serve. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the fastest flat serve, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the spinniest kick serve, but it all looked the same.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAnd (my contribution) is taking these techniques from the research lab and repurpose them as drill and practice. Drill and practice: the bottom feeder of all instructional technology. What elements of extraordinary performances that we observe in many contexts — they just happen to be more measurable on TV and in sports, but they exist everywhere — how can we reduce that to something that can be drilled and practiced?\nA tool for police investigations Wong covers the story of the project in the podcast at about the 29:26 mark (a), explaining that \u0026ldquo;when we started the work, I was really intent about designing a system that would focus on actually creating an environment that would enable insight. Particularly the kind of sensemaking described by Gary Klein\u0026rsquo;s Data-Frame model [Data-frame model], and particularly his triple path model of insight [Triple path model of insight] (\u0026hellip;) I wanted them (in the consortium) to think about sensemaking and insight, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have that, all you\u0026rsquo;re going to build is a search and retrieval system, which is what every other intelligence analysis system is about!\u0026rdquo;\nWrapping up If I may generalise timidly, I would say that all three show an approach where the researcher extracts the cognitive processes of experts, and then teaches the novice by making them simulate those same cognitive processes. The key word here is simulation:\nThe IED defeat training program focused on high cognitive fidelity to the real-world task; the video game was simply a medium to help students acquire the mental model that seasoned marines use to predict IEDs emplacement. The tennis training program worked because it took apart this tacit macro-cognition aspect of tennis serve recognition, and then taught it to novices by simulating through an occlusion exercise. Fadde could have taught it via lecture. He didn\u0026rsquo;t. The VALCRI project extracted the insight generation process that criminal intelligence analysts used, and then designed an entire system around it. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that all three examples are drawn from the NDM podcast (a). This isn\u0026rsquo;t an accident! My current hack to learn the NDM method of designing training programs is to listen to as many NDM podcast interviews as possible. My goal: to collect as many prototypes of effective training interventions as I can.\n\u0026lsquo;Listen to the NDM podcast\u0026rsquo; happens to be my recommendation if you want to do the same. It strikes me as somewhat ironic: the best practitioners of tacit knowledge extraction have yet to explicate a coherent explanation of their training methods. You\u0026rsquo;d think that they would have a generalised framework for training by now. Or at least a review paper. And, again \u0026hellip; perhaps they have! Perhaps they have a review paper somewhere, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t found it yet.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll tell you if I do. Till then, the best that we have is casual consumption of the NDM podcasts (a). I recommend you join me in doing so. If you\u0026rsquo;re as obsessed with learning as I am, I think you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I do.\nBibliography References Naturalistic Decision Making. 2020. “Episode \\#4: Interview with Jennifer Phillips.” Listen Notes. https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/naturalistic/episode-4-interview-with-5av4UMGzFPf/.

These papers included those which supplied details as intricate as the cross-section and machining instructions for the electrodes and even the manufacturers\u0026rsquo; part numbers for bought-in items. It showed, however, that only those who spent some time socially interacting with others who had already built a working model could succeed.\nIt seems that the act of building a working TEA laser involves all sorts of tiny details that the original creators did not think to explicate. And even if they did make an effort to do so, Collins is not sure that the results would have been any different \u0026mdash; some of these things were tiny tweaks that everyone in the lab group understood, but nobody had thought of as important knowledge.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s Collins again, on a different group of scientists:\nMy 2001 study of scientists trying to measure the quality factor, or Q, of sapphire, backed up the earlier work by showing that measurements of the quality factor of small sapphire crystals were so hard that only one group of scientists in the world were able to achieve them until a member of the successful Russian group spent considerable time in the laboratory of a second group, in Glasgow, who finally managed it after a week or so of interaction.\nCollins appears to enjoy using the laser example and the sapphire example because the scientists were working from detailed specifications published in peer-reviewed journals \u0026hellip; and they were working in physics and material science respectively \u0026mdash; both of them \u0026lsquo;hard sciences\u0026rsquo;!

But: When it comes to human behaviour, the ease with which we pick up the three forms of tacit knowledge is reversed! It is easiest for us to pick up collective tacit knowledge — we begin socialisation from birth; we don\u0026rsquo;t even notice when we absorb social context from our surroundings. In comparison, it is slightly harder to pick up somatic tacit knowledge, and it is most difficult to pick up relational tacit knowledge, since this hangs on the nature of expertise, and it the depends on the ways with which we relate to each other.

Without augmentation, explicitly memorizing information is quite onerous, so it\u0026rsquo;s not something people often do. It\u0026rsquo;s reserved for extremely important details, details which are worthy of memorization\u0026rsquo;s high costs.\nBut Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient (a). Deciding to remember something is not a high-stakes decision; it\u0026rsquo;s a decision that\u0026rsquo;ll cost a fraction of a minute over the next couple years. These systems wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be very interesting if you only used them to memorize the kinds of material you already memorize, because most people don\u0026rsquo;t explicitly memorize very much. Not only do Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice (a), but they make it an almost costless choice. Emotionally, it\u0026rsquo;s closer to choosing what to highlight or write marginalia next to on a book page. And practically speaking, when a once-expensive resource becomes nearly costless, surprising things can happen (e.g. electricity).\nThe way I add material to memory systems feels like a gesture.

To collect is a reward in itself. As knowledge workers, we\u0026rsquo;re inclined to look for the next groundbreaking thought, for intellectual stimulation: we pile up promising books and articles, and we store half the internet as bookmarks, just so we get the feeling of being on the cutting edge.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s call this \u0026ldquo;The Collector\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy\u0026rdquo;. Why fallacy? Because \u0026rsquo;to know about something\u0026rsquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as \u0026lsquo;knowing something\u0026rsquo;. Just knowing about a thing is less than superficial since knowing about is merely to be certain of its existence, nothing more. Ultimately, this fake-knowledge is hindering us on our road to true excellence. Until we merge the contents, the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven\u0026rsquo;t really learned a thing. We don\u0026rsquo;t change ourselves if we don\u0026rsquo;t learn, so merely filing things away doesn\u0026rsquo;t lead us anywhere.\nCollectors don\u0026rsquo;t make progress Preparing reading material alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t get you anywhere. It\u0026rsquo;s quite common that students prepare lots and lots of photocopies of the texts they have to read \u0026mdash; and stop just there. The copies grow to be an alibi, says Umberto Eco in his book \u0026ldquo;How to Write a Thesis\u0026rdquo; (a): \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s a lot someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about precisely because she photocopied a text; she has given herself in to the illusion of having read the text already.\u0026rdquo; (That\u0026rsquo;s from page 162 of the German translation; I translated the quote from there since it precedes the publication of the official English translation.)\nThe worst we could do is to pile up copies until the stack grows intimidatingly high, until it becomes unmanageable. After that it will be ignored in its entirety. Because to take a photocopy of a text is so much faster than actually reading it and learning what\u0026rsquo;s inside, we tend to amass days worth of deliberate reading in about half an hour standing next to the copier. We have to pay attention not to copy more texts than we may handle.\nThe same holds true when it comes to managing bookmarks. We stumble upon an interesting web page and don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose the information, thus we keep it as a bookmark. The digital pile of bookmarks isn\u0026rsquo;t any different from a tangible pile of papers we consider worth knowing. Here, too, kept isn\u0026rsquo;t read, though.\nResearch, read, assimilate; rinse and repeat Collecting, just as Eco warned us, does not magically increase our knowledge. We have to read a text effectively to assimilate its ideas and learn from it. Reading effectively means the text changes our knowledge permanently. Only when we learn from it and begin to work with the ideas it presents. We need to extract what\u0026rsquo;s inside and write things down.\nIf we read without taking notes, our knowledge increases for a short time only. Once we forget what we knew, having read the text becomes worthless. You can bet that you\u0026rsquo;ll forget about the text\u0026rsquo;s information one day. It\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed. Thus, reading without taking notes is just a waste of time in the long run. It\u0026rsquo;s as if reading never happened.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the reason we are used to picking up a reference text again and again when we work on our writing projects. We read and take the information from the text, put it in our short-term memory, get back to our own draft and pour in the information. We transfer information from one place to another but fail to increase our knowledge on the way. That\u0026rsquo;s the usual, inefficient way.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s only rational to take notes when you read a text because a system of notes can become an extension to your mind and memory (a). This will integrate the text\u0026rsquo;s information into our own knowledge. To increase one\u0026rsquo;s knowledge is a meaningful and the only sustainable way of working with information. Instead of shoveling information from the source text into your own project with the help of your working memory, you can integrate it into your knowledge system once and have it available forever. We may expand our knowledge permanently only by storing notes permanently.\nTaking notes thoroughly means you can rely on your notes alone and rarely need to look up a detail in the original text.\nI rarely consult secondary sources again. If I have to do so, it means that I did not do the job right the first time.\nMK, of \u0026ldquo;Taking Note Now\u0026rdquo; (a)\nThis is a first step to conquer Collector\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy: to realize that having a text at hand does nothing to increase our knowledge. We have to work with it instead. Reading alone won\u0026rsquo;t suffice: we have to create notes, too, to create real, sustainable knowledge.\nEspecially when we start to research something new, Eco recommends we read and highlight texts right after we create copies in \u0026ldquo;How to Write a Thesis\u0026rdquo; (a).\n^{1 (a)} If we train ourselves to process photocopied texts soon, we get a feeling of how much we can really handle.\nShorter cycles of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation are better than long ones. With every full cycle from research to knowledge assimilation, we learn more about the topic. When we know more, our decisions are more informed, thus our research gets more efficient. If, on the other hand, we take home a big pile of material to read and process, some of it will turn out be useless once we finished parts of the pile. To minimize waste, both of time and of paper, it\u0026rsquo;s beneficial to immerse oneself step by step and learn on the way instead of making big up-front decisions based on guesswork.\nThe habit of keeping the cycle of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation short is a powerful way to circumvent our innate addiction to gather piles of stuff.\nUpdate 2014-07-17: More recently, I wrote about this topic and included a more elaborate schedule to form a counter-habit. It\u0026rsquo;s called the Knowledge Cycle (a).\nTo form a habit, you have to set yourself actionable limits and keep score.\nTo get started, do research for one hour and no second more. Process the collected material until the stack is empty. Then do a quick review of the cycle: how well did it go? Did you learn something new? Was it too much or too little you found in the amount of time? Afterwards, change the time limit a bit if you think it wasn\u0026rsquo;t appropriate. Repeat the cycle and keep track of your perceived productivity until you establish a feedback-supported routine which suits your needs.\nBibliography References Tieze, Christian. 22AD. “The Collector’s Fallacy.” Zettelkasten Method. https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/.

The origins of this attitude can be traced to a famous monograph published by Paul Meehl in 1954. Meehl (1954) reviewed approximately 20 studies that compared the accuracy of forecasts made by human judges (mostly clinical psychologists) and those predicted by simple statistical models. The criteria in the studies that Meehl (1954) discussed were diverse, with outcome measures ranging from academic success to patient recidivism and propensity for violence.

This is covered more fully in my original piece (a) (relevant section linked). There are situations where changing environments render credible advice from believable people mistaken. But in order to disregard such advice, you should have a credible argument for why you believe expertise can be discounted. Effective advice often sounds insightful, but advice that sounds insightful is not always effective. It is easy to conflate the two. It is easier still to do so when one is on Twitter. Due to confounding factors (such as genetics, privilege, luck, and external circumstances), believable advice may still be inapplicable. The practitioner\u0026rsquo;s art is to investigate the essence of the technique while adapting it from the unique circumstances of its original application. There are likely more second-order implications.

Some domains are more auspicious than others. Notes This article reports on an effort to explore the differences between two approaches to intuition and expertise that are often viewed as conflicting: heuristics and biases (HB) and naturalistic decision making (NDM). Starting from the obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed, the authors attempt to map the boundary conditions that separate true intuitive skill from overconfident and biased impressions. They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual\u0026rsquo;s opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.\nIn this article we report on an effort to compare our views on the issues of intuition and expertise and to discuss the evidence for our respective positions. When we launched this project, we expected to disagree on many issues, and with good reason: One of us (GK) has spent much of his career thinking about ways to promote reliance on expert intuition in executive decision making and identifies himself as a member of the intellectual community of scholars and practitioners who study naturalistic decision making (NDM). The other (DK) has spent much of his career running experiments in which intuitive judgment was commonly found to be flawed; he is identified with the \u0026ldquo;heuristics and biases\u0026rdquo; (HB) approach to the field.\nTwo perspectives Origins of the Naturalistic decision making approach The NDM approach, which focuses on the successes of expert intuition, grew out of early research on master chess players conducted by deGroot (1946/1978) and later by Chase and Simon (1973). DeGroot showed that chess grand masters were generally able to identify the most promising moves rapidly, while mediocre chess players often did not even consider the best moves. The chess grand masters mainly differed from weaker players in their unusual ability to appreciate the dynamics of complex positions and quickly judge a line of play as promising or fruitless. Chase and Simon (1973) described the performance of chess experts as a form of perceptual skill in which complex patterns are recognized. They estimated that chess masters acquire a repertoire of 50,000 to 100,000 immediately recognizable patterns, and that this repertoire enables them to identify a good move without having to calculate all possible contingencies.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA central goal of NDM is to demystify intuition by identifying the cues that experts use to make their judgments, even if those cues involve tacit knowledge and are difficult for the expert to articulate. In this way, NDM researchers try to learn from expert professionals. Many NDM researchers use cognitive task analysis [Cognitive task analysis] (CTA) methods to investigate the cues and strategies that skilled decision makers apply (Crandall, Klein, \u0026amp; Hoffman, 2006; Schraagen, Chipman, \u0026amp; Shalin, 2000).\nOrigins of the Heuristics and biases approach In sharp contrast to NDM, the HB approach favors a skeptical attitude toward expertise and expert judgment. The origins of this attitude can be traced to a famous monograph published by Paul Meehl in 1954. Meehl (1954) reviewed approximately 20 studies that compared the accuracy of forecasts made by human judges (mostly clinical psychologists) and those predicted by simple statistical models. The criteria in the studies that Meehl (1954) discussed were diverse, with outcome measures ranging from academic success to patient recidivism and propensity for violence. Although the algorithms were based on a subset of the information available to the clinicians, statistical predictions were more accurate than human predictions in almost every case. Meehl (1954) believed that the inferiority of clinical judgment was due in part to systematic errors, such as the consistent neglect of the base rates of outcomes in discussion of individual cases. In a wellknown article, he later explained his reluctance to attend clinical conferences by citing his annoyance with the clinicians\u0026rsquo; uncritical reliance on their intuition and their failure to apply elementary statistical reasoning (Meehl, 1973).\nContrasts between the naturalistic decision making and heuristics and biases approaches Stance regarding expertise and decision algorithms There is no logical inconsistency between the observations that inspired the NDM and HB approaches to professional judgment: The intuitive judgments of some professionals are impressively skilled, while the judgments of other professionals are remarkably flawed. Although not contradictory, these core observations suggest conflicting generalizations about the utility of expert judgment. Members of the HB community are of course aware of the existence of skill and expertise, but they tend to focus on flaws in human cognitive performance. Members of the NDM community know that professionals often err, but they tend to stress the marvels of successful expert performance.\nThe basic stance of HB researchers, as they consider experts, is one of skepticism. They are trained to look for opportunities to compare expert performance with performance by formal models or rules and to expect that experts will do poorly in such comparisons. They are predisposed to recommend the replacement of informal judgment by algorithms whenever possible. Researchers in the NDM tradition are more likely to adopt an admiring stance toward experts. They are trained to explore the thinking of experts, hoping to identify critical features of the situation that are obvious to experts but invisible to novices and journeymen, and then to search for ways to pass on the experts\u0026rsquo; secrets to others in the field. NDM researchers are disposed to have little faith in formal approaches because they are generally skeptical about attempts to impose universal structures and rules on judgments and choices that will be made in complex contexts.\nSkilled intuition as recognition Simon (1992) offered a concise definition of skilled intuition that we both endorse: \u0026ldquo;The situation has provided a cue: This cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition\u0026rdquo; (p. 155).\nSee also Cedric Chin | Expertise Is \u0026lsquo;Just\u0026rsquo; Pattern Matching.\nIn other environments, the regularities that can be observed are misleading. Hogarth (2001) introduced the useful notion of wicked environments [Wicked environment], in which wrong intuitions are likely to develop. His most compelling example (borrowed from Lewis Thomas) is the early 20th century physician who frequently had intuitions about patients in the ward who were about to develop typhoid. He confirmed his intuitions by palpating these patients\u0026rsquo; tongues, but because he did not wash his hands the intuitions were disastrously self-fulfilling.\nTwo conditions must be satisfied for skilled intuition to develop: an environment of sufficiently high validity and adequate opportunity to practice the skill.\nConclusion Our starting point is that intuitive judgments can arise from genuine skill—the focus of the NDM approach— but that they can also arise from inappropriate application of the heuristic processes on which students of the HB tradition have focused. Skilled judges are often unaware of the cues that guide them, and individuals whose intuitions are not skilled are even less likely to know where their judgments come from. True experts, it is said, know when they don\u0026rsquo;t know. However, nonexperts (whether or not they think they are) certainly do not know when they don\u0026rsquo;t know. Subjective confidence is therefore an unreliable indication of the validity of intuitive judgments and decisions. The determination of whether intuitive judgments can be trusted requires an examination of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the opportunity that the judge has had to learn the regularities of that environment. We describe task environments as \u0026ldquo;high-validity\u0026rdquo; if there are stable relationships between objectively identifiable cues and subsequent events or between cues and the outcomes of possible actions. Medicine and firefighting are practiced in environments of fairly high validity. In contrast, outcomes are effectively unpredictable in zero-validity environments. To a good approximation, predictions of the future value of individual stocks and long-term forecasts of political events are made in a zero-validity environment. Validity and uncertainty are not incompatible. Some environments are both highly valid and substantially uncertain. Poker and warfare are examples. The best moves in such situations reliably increase the potential for success. An environment of high validity is a necessary condition for the development of skilled intuitions. Other necessary conditions include adequate opportunities for learning the environment (prolonged practice and feedback that is both rapid and unequivocal). If an environment provides valid cues and good feedback, skill and expert intuition will eventually develop in individuals of sufficient talent. Although true skill cannot develop in irregular or unpredictable environments, individuals will sometimes make judgments and decisions that are successful by chance. These \u0026ldquo;lucky\u0026rdquo; individuals will be susceptible to an illusion of skill and to overconfidence (Arkes, 2001). The financial industry is a rich source of examples. The situation that we have labeled fractionation of skill is another source of overconfidence. Professionals who have expertise in some tasks are sometimes called upon to make judgments in areas in which they have no real skill. (For example, financial analysts may be skilled at evaluating the likely commercial success of a firm, but this skill does not extend to the judgment of whether the stock of that firm is underpriced.) It is difficult both for the professionals and for those who observe them to determine the boundaries of their true expertise. We agree that the weak regularities available in low-validity situations can sometimes support the development of algorithms that do better than chance. These algorithms only achieve limited accuracy, but they outperform humans because of their advantage of consistency. However, the introduction of algorithms to replace human judgment is likely to evoke substantial resistance and sometimes has undesirable side effects.

I knew the hotel was many miles down this long, branchless road. So I drove for a long while.\nAfter a while, I began to worry I had passed the hotel.\nSo, instead of proceeding at 60 miles per hour the way I had been, I continued in the same direction for several more minutes at 30 miles per hour, wondering if I should keep going or turn around.\nAfter a while, I realized: I was being silly! If the hotel was ahead of me, I\u0026rsquo;d get there fastest if I kept going 60mph. And if the hotel was behind me, I\u0026rsquo;d get there fastest by heading at 60 miles per hour in the other direction. And if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to turn around yet \u0026ndash; if my best bet given the uncertainty was to check N more miles of highway first, before I turned around \u0026ndash; then, again, I\u0026rsquo;d get there fastest by choosing a value of N, speeding along at 60 miles per hour until my odometer said I\u0026rsquo;d gone N miles, and then turning around and heading at 60 miles per hour in the opposite direction [Feedback loop].\nEither way, fullspeed was best. My mind had been naively averaging two courses of action \u0026ndash; the thought was something like: \u0026ldquo;maybe I should go forward, and maybe I should go backward. So, since I\u0026rsquo;m uncertain, I should go forward at half-speed!\u0026rdquo; But averages don\u0026rsquo;t actually work that way.\nFollowing this, I started noticing lots of hotels in my life (and, perhaps less tactfully, in my friends\u0026rsquo; lives). For example:\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I was a good enough writer to write a given doc myself, or if I should try to outsource it. So, I sat there kind-of-writing it (a) while also fretting about whether the task was correct. (Solution: Take a minute out to think through heuristics. Then, either: (1) write the post at full speed; or (2) try to outsource it; or (3) write full force for some fixed time period, and then pause and evaluate.) I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure (back in early 2012) that CFAR was worthwhile. So, I kind-of worked on it. An old friend came to my door unexpectedly, and I was tempted to hang out with her, but I also thought I should finish my work. So I kind-of hung out with her while feeling bad and distracted about my work. A friend of mine, when teaching me math, seems to mumble specifically those words that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t expect me to understand (in a sort of compromise between saying them and not saying them)\u0026hellip; Duncan reports (a) that novice Parkour students are unable to safely undertake certain sorts of jumps, because they risk aborting the move mid-stream, after the actual last safe stopping point (apparently kind-of-attempting these jumps is more dangerous than either attempting, or not attempting the jumps) It is said that start-up founders need to be irrationally certain that their startup will succeed, lest they be unable to do more than kind-of work on it\u0026hellip; That is, it seems to me that often there are two different actions that would make sense under two different models, and we are uncertain which model is true\u0026hellip; and so we find ourselves taking an intermediate of half-speed action\u0026hellip; even when that action makes no sense under any probabilistic mixture of the two models.\nYou might try looking out for such examples in your life.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:salamonCorrectResponseUncertaintyNotHalfspeed ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/60fa0766-a524-4d7d-9b43-5fe7967671ed/","summary":"Anna Salamon, (NO_ITEM_DATA:salamonCorrectResponseUncertaintyNotHalfspeed)\nSummary When choosing between east and west, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense to go north; you need to pick one.\nThoughts Related: No half measures, Just start, Seek clarification, Feedback loop\nNotes Once upon a time (true story), I was on my way to a hotel in a new city.

The building itself was a 150 m (500 ft) tall sphere, taller than the Great Pyramids of Giza,[1] encompassed by two large barriers circled by hundreds of cypress trees. The massive and spheric shape of the building was inspired by Boullée\u0026rsquo;s own study called \u0026ldquo;theory of bodies\u0026rdquo; where he claims that the most beautiful and perfect natural body is the sphere, which is the most prominent element of the Newton Memorial. [\u0026hellip;] The small sarcophagus for Newton is placed at the lower pole of the sphere. The design of the memorial is intended to create the effect of day and night. The night effect occurs when the sarcophagus is illuminated by the sunlight coming through the holes in the vaulting, giving the illusion of stars in the night sky. The day effect is an armillary sphere hanging in the center that gives off a mysterious glow.\n(“Étienne-Louis Boullée” 2023)\nBibliography References “Étienne-Louis Boullée.” 2023.

This means the difficulty of the exercise you have chosen, or the number of reps you have performed exceeds the capability of your intrinsic core muscles (mostly your transverse abdominis). This is a good marker for appropriate intensity. If you feel this, make it easier.\nLevel 0: Breathing Deadbug Level 0: Breath Control (a)\n[\u0026hellip;] lie flat on your back with your knees up (you can also put your legs up on a chair, or your bed). Place one hand on your upper chest (just below your neck, around your collarbones) and the other between the bottom of your ribs and your belly-button.\nBreathe in and out. Your upper hand should not move. Your lower hand should move up and down with your breath.\nLevel 1: Static hold Deadbug Level 1: Static Hold (a)\nLie on the ground, with your knees up and feet on the floor just in front of your butt, relaxed. Take a nice deep diaphragm-driven breath in, and then start to breathe all your air out like you\u0026rsquo;re blowing out through a big straw As you are breathing out, start ratcheting up the tension in your brace, engaging all the core muscles as we outlined above: Ribs Down (Rectus Abs and/or Internal Obliques) Belly in (Transverse Abs) Ribs Narrow/Together (Internal Obliques) Once you are fully tense and fully out of air, you can lift the legs up to 90 degrees, and start taking little sips of air, expanding mostly into your sides and back, but also potentially into your belly if you have that degree of control over your internal obliques. If you can\u0026rsquo;t yet do either, sorry you\u0026rsquo;ll have to hold your breath or else you\u0026rsquo;ll lose tension. At no point should your lower back lose gentle contact with the floor. It should not be pressing hard into it, but it also should not be arched. Deadbug Level 1a: One Arm Extension (a) Deadbug Level 1b: Both Arm Extension (a) This variation of deadbug is useful for individuals who struggle not to flare their ribs in things like handstands, overhead presses, and such. [\u0026hellip;] if you have a very weak brace, then simply moving your arms as far overhead as you can will involuntarily cause your ribs to lift in order to compensate.\nDeadbug Error #1: Rib Flare (a) Level 2: 90 degree one-leg extension Deadbug Level 2: 90deg Heel Taps (a)\nIn the braced, static deadbug position, keeping your legs locked at 90 degrees of knee bend, slowly lower one leg down until the heel gently touches the floor, then return it to the start position. Repeat with the other leg, that\u0026rsquo;s one rep.\nLevel 3: Single-leg extension Deadbug Level 3: Single Leg Extension (a)\n[\u0026hellip;] starting in the braced static starting position, slowly extend one leg out, reaching your heel far out and down until your leg is straight. In a scenario of ideal hip flexibility, you should seek to reach your calf to the floor (depending on the size of your calf, your only your heel may touch as mine does, this is fine). If your hip flexibility is limited, only lower the leg as far to the floor as you can without losing your mid-line position (i.e. without your lower back arching to compensate).\nLevel 4: Contralateral extension (opposite limb; marching) Deadbug Level 4: Contralateral Extensions (a)\nFurther difficulty can be added by mixing the arms and legs movement, performing opposite extensions every rep (e.g. left arm extends out, so right leg extends out, and vice versa).\nLevel 5: Double-leg extension Deadbug Level 5: Double Leg Extension (a)\nFor further challenge to the core, both legs can be extended at the same time.\nDeadbug Error #2: Lumbar Extension (a)\nLevel 6: Full layout Deadbug Level 6: Full Layouts (a)\nThe final progression of the deadbug before you start to add external weight in the hands and feet is the Deadbug Lay-out. Both arms, both legs.\nThoughts Notes The Deadbug is without a doubt, the single most important core exercise out there, in my opinion. Through the process of learning and improving in deadbugs over time, you are not only:\nWorking out \u0026lsquo;your core\u0026rsquo;, You will also be learning a lot about how to breathe properly (the way your body is \u0026ldquo;meant\u0026rdquo; to) and how that is related to core activation AND most importantly, you will learn how to coordinate all of your core muscles together to stabilise your mid-line (i.e. your spine and everything that moves when it moves) against resistance and even when your limbs are moving, which is incredibly important for bodyweight exercise and barbell training alike. This process is referred to as \u0026lsquo;Bracing\u0026rsquo;.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIt takes a long time and a lot of practice to refine your control of your breathing and develop a fine and articulate command of your individual core muscles, so the sooner you start learning it in your journey, the sooner you can reap the benefits of it being performed correctly.\nControlling your breathing for our very first step, we are going to practice breathing only from the diaphragm, without making those accessory muscles do any work.\nTo do this, lie flat on your back with your knees up (you can also put your legs up on a chair, or your bed).\nPlace one hand on your upper chest (just below your neck, around your collarbones) and the other between the bottom of your ribs and your belly-button.\nNow try breathing, just normally as you would. What you might find is any of the following:\nYour upper hand moves up as you breathe in and down as you breathe out, but your lower hand does not (This means your accessory breathing muscles are working far too hard, and your diaphragm is working extremely inefficiently) Both your upper and lower hands both move up and down as you breathe in and out (The diaphragm is working more but the accessory muscles are still working when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) Your lower hand moves, but your upper hand does not (The diaphragm is working well, and the accessory muscles are relaxed as they should be) We are aiming to achieve the third outcome there: The bottom hand should rise and fall as you breathe, but there should be no movement in the top hand, as seen below:\nDeadbug Level 0: Breath Control (a)\nYou may need to practice this for 5-10 minutes or even more to achieve this consistently, or you may be able to do it immediately. In any case, work on this until you can, then move on.\n(Extra credit: if you can do this perfectly, place both hands on the sides of your lower back and try again. If you can create expansion here too, your diaphragm is really firing on all cylinders, so to speak.)\nBracing and the \u0026lsquo;Static Deadbug Hold\u0026rsquo; The brace is, essentially, contracting almost everything all at once, so to brace, we will be simultaneously:\nPushing the belly (and sides and back, if you\u0026rsquo;re good) out with the diaphragm (Full Brace Only*) Pulling the belly in with the transverse abdominis Drawing the sides together with the internal obliques Bringing the ribs down with the internal obliques, and optionally the rectus abdominis depending on the type of brace (or, at first, likely only the rectus abdominis) [\u0026hellip;]\nFull brace The \u0026lsquo;Full\u0026rsquo; Brace is used during scenarios where you are manipulating vey heavy external loads, such as barbell training, picking up a sofa, or a heavy box. This is because in lifting heavy loads, it is very important (not only for your ability to express your strength to its fullest ability, but also for the safety of the movement on your back) that your spine stays rigid and unmoving in its chosen position. By having some air in your lungs, it really gives something for the brace to \u0026lsquo;bite down on\u0026rsquo;, so to speak.\nThe best way to explain this is with the analogy of a can of soda. If you push into the side of an open or empty can of soda, the can deforms very easily. You could probably bend it in half if you wanted to. This is what your back is like when you are not braced.\nHowever, if you tried to push into a closed can of soda, it would be much harder. This is because the liquid, and the gas inside of it, is pushing outwards against the walls of the can, stabilising it. That\u0026rsquo;s what a brace is like.\nA FULL brace is like if you tried to push your thumb into the side of a can of soda you had just vigorously shaken up a few moments prior. All the gas has escaped from the liquid, and is pushing HARD against the can. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t dent that sucker if you tried.\nEmpty brace [\u0026hellip;] an empty brace takes the above concepts and uses them against the core muscles in order to force them to work harder. By bracing with absolutely minimal air in your lungs, your core has to contract and compress so much harder to find even 1/10 of the stability and tension.\nIs this not just a \u0026lsquo;Hollow Hold\u0026rsquo;? If you are familiar with bodyweight fitness or gymnastics strength training, you may know of a common gymnastics core conditioning exercise known as the \u0026lsquo;hollow body hold\u0026rsquo;. Many people I\u0026rsquo;ve come into contact that fit this description are perplexed by the deadbug, often saying \u0026lsquo;so, basically a hollow hold, right?\u0026rsquo;. If you were to look at the starting progression of both, you would see they\u0026rsquo;re quite similar.\nHollow hold: Starting position\nDeadbug: Starting position\nHowever, when investigating their purpose, their internal cues, and their full end progressions, you can see a stark difference between them:\nFull hollow: End position\nDeadbug: End position\nSo looking at the end position, you can see that the hollow aims to achieve what is called a \u0026lsquo;globally flexed\u0026rsquo; position, as it is one of the two fundamental body shapes (The other being the \u0026lsquo;Arch Hold\u0026rsquo;, a globally extended position) that a gymnast needs to be able to maintain under high speeds of tumbling and flipping though the air in various apparati events.\nThis globally flexed position and lack of focus on internal cueing in favour of focus on external shape and rigid tension from the tips of the fingers to the tips of the toes means this exercise predominantly works the rectus abdominis, like many other core exercises.\nConversely, deadbugs are an exercise in full, complete, coordinated core bracing in a neutral (or slightly flexed in the lower back) spine position. The focus is very much on the brace, not necessarily on the shape, there is little to no tension in the limbs, and it is performed with an \u0026rsquo;empty brace\u0026rsquo; to maximally challenge the core. It is also not simply enough to replicate the look of deadbugs; if the transverse abdominis, or the internal obliques are not properly contracting for example, the deadbug is not being properly performed because the brace is not complete or coordinated.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:nick-eDeadbugUltimateGuideMasteringCoreStrength2018 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/8c39a71d-954c-44e9-9073-cf93cc7788e0/","summary":"Nicholas Elorreaga, (NO_ITEM_DATA:nick-eDeadbugUltimateGuideMasteringCoreStrength2018)\nSummary Progression You may find at some progression that you start to feel the muscular effort and tension more-so in your lower back muscles than your core.

This presupposes that you (1) can recognize the situation and (2) know the right course of action. If either supposition is false, then refer to the flow chart:\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:chinCopyingBetterHowAcquireTacitKnowledgeExperts2020)\nHow to improve at Recognition-primed decision making? Systematically Expand the Set of Prototypes You Have\nThe first method of application follows easily from the model: because so much of expertise is pattern matching, many of the training programs that are designed by NDM [Naturalistic decision making] practitioners are oriented around expanding the set of prototypes in their learners\u0026rsquo;s heads. [\u0026hellip;] seek out situations where you have less experience, in order to expand the set of prototypes in your head. Another way might be to select and use exercises that help build out the prototypes you have; [\u0026hellip;]\nIdentify When A Practitioner Has a Prototype That You Do Not\nAnother, less obvious way to use RPD is to identify when a practitioner is using her intuition. When you notice a practitioner making a rapid assessment of a problem, when they say \u0026ldquo;it just felt right\u0026rdquo;, or when they give you an explanation that is full of caveats and gotchas, you now know that they are using an implicit-memory recognition operation that stems from their experiences. If you face a similar situation and you find yourself doing option comparison, this should tell you that your colleague has a prototype that you do not, and that this might be something you want to acquire.\nIn other words, you can use this to build a skill tree for yourself.\nRPD is useful because you should also know to ask about the cues, expectancies, priorities, and courses of actions that present themselves in the practitioner\u0026rsquo;s mind. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: this will not be a good extraction of their tacit knowledge, because expert intuition is difficult to explicate, and CTA is itself difficult. But it\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly useful to just ask questions along these lines [\u0026hellip;]\nGet Better At Mental Simulations\nA second lever that falls out of the RPD model is the idea of giving learners sufficient experiences in order to simulate effectively.\nRecall that mental simulation is a key part of RPD: it drives the identification of expectancies, and it allows practitioners to simulate possible courses of action before picking one to execute. More experiences mean more accurate mental simulations.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s just plain difficult to create appropriate training programs for yourself. One way around this is to reflect on your past experiences, and then go to more skilful practitioners to get feedback on the actions that you chose in past events.\nWhen doing so, it\u0026rsquo;s important to copy the method that\u0026rsquo;s used in CTA: you should describe the event linearly, as you experienced it, never revealing more information than you had at the time. For instance, if you want to make better decisions around managing people, you might choose to describe an experience where a subordinate reacted negatively to you, and walk through that event as it unfolded. You should not tell the expert what you discovered later, after the events had already transpired. In simple terms: you should put the expert in your shoes.\nWhen doing this, compare:\nWhat cues it was that you noticed vs what cues they picked up on. (Sometimes this could be expressed in the follow-up questions they ask during your story-telling.) What you expected to happen next vs what they expected to happen next. What actions you thought to do vs what actions they thought to do, And finally: what priorities you had in that situation, vs what priorities they might have instead. I\u0026rsquo;ve adapted this idea from Klein\u0026rsquo;s cognitive critique [\u0026hellip;]\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:chinCopyingBetterHowAcquireTacitKnowledgeExperts2020), formatting mine\nNotes Recognition-primed decision (RPD) is a model of how people make quick, effective decisions when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected [Satisficing]. RPD has been described in diverse groups including trauma nurses, fireground commanders, chess players, and stock market traders. It functions well in conditions of time pressure, and in which information is partial and goals poorly defined. The limitations of RPD include the need for extensive experience among decision-makers (in order to correctly recognize the salient features of a problem and model solutions) and the problem of the failure of recognition and modeling in unusual or misidentified circumstances.\n(“Recognition-Primed Decision” 2023)\nThere are three variations in RPD strategy.\nIf \u0026hellip;, then \u0026hellip;: Decision makers recognize the situation as typical: a scenario where both the situational detail and the detail of relevant courses of action are known. If (???), then \u0026hellip;: The decision maker diagnoses an unknown situation to choose from a known selection of courses of action. If \u0026hellip;, then (???): The decision maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware of the proper course of action. The decision maker therefore implements a mental trial and error simulation to develop the most effective course of action. (“Recognition-Primed Decision” 2023), paraphrased, formatting mine\nThe recognition-primed decision making model describes what humans do when they are problem solving in the real world. It tells us that when an expert encounters a problem in the wild, their brain observes the situation in a changing environment and immediately pattern matches it against a collection of prototypes. If they recognise what they see as an example of a prototype \u0026mdash; even if the situation they see is non-routine! \u0026mdash; their brain immediately generates four things:\nA set of \u0026rsquo;expectancies\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash; When diagnosing a situation, experts will construct mental simulations of how the events have been evolving and will continue to evolve. In other words, they will have some expectations for what happens next. The more experienced they are, the more clear-cut these expectancies become. For example, an experienced firefighter might take in a scene and know instantly where the fire might travel, or how a bad situation might develop. A programmer reading a codebase might find several weird kludges, and immediately suspect a submodule to be a persistent source of bugs. A set of plausible goals \u0026mdash; The expert would know what to prioritise in the moment, and what to defer to a latter time. When under fire, for instance, a Marine Corps squad leader would have to prioritise between keeping his people alive, getting to better cover, and achieving mission objectives. His recognised prototype tells him where his priorities lie in a given situation, freeing cognitive resources to conduct other forms of thinking. Similarly, a programmer may receive a set of business requirements, and immediately generate a prioritised list of goals in their head according to the recognised prototype. A set of relevant cues \u0026mdash; Experts know what to pay attention to; novices do not. Recognised prototypes come with a set of cues \u0026mdash; for instance, when you\u0026rsquo;ve just started driving, you may find yourself overwhelmed with the dials and knobs and mirrors you have to keep track of. After a few months, however, you do these things automatically, and shift your attention to specific affordances in your car depending on the situation. (For instance, when turning a corner, you know to check your side mirrors and you know what to watch out for.) An action script \u0026mdash; Last, but not least, if the situation is typical, the expert would have a course of action immediately generated in their heads. If the situation is not typical, the expert\u0026rsquo;s brain would still generate a set of actions, but the expert would slow down to walk through each action step in their head. The recognition of goals, cues, expectancies and actions is part of what it means to recognise a situation. What is important to understand is that all of this recognition happens within implicit memory. This is why experts are not able to verbalise what they are doing.\nImplicit memory operations are subconscious. Our ability to recognise faces, for instance, is an implicit memory operation, and we cannot say how it happens. When your friend Mary walks into the room, you immediately recognise her face. But notice that remembering her name is a different process entirely: this is because facial recognition is recognition; name retrieval is recall, and the two operations use different subsystems in your brain. (Gillund \u0026amp; Shiffrin, 1984 (a))\nWhen an expert says \u0026ldquo;it just felt right\u0026rdquo;, what they mean to say is that they recognised the problem as an example of a prototype in their heads, which generated the four by-products; this implicit memory operation happens so quickly that they cannot verbalise how they came up with it. They can only say \u0026ldquo;it just felt right!\u0026rdquo;, the same way you might say of an acquaintance: \u0026ldquo;I know her, I just can\u0026rsquo;t remember her name!\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn most cases, however, the default human response is to satisfice: that is, to generate and then cycle through actions one at a time until the first suitable one is found.\nRPD is useful because it gives us a model with which to understand human expertise. When you apprentice under someone, what\u0026rsquo;s actually happening is that you are building up prototypes in your implicit memory \u0026mdash; that is, you are identifying cues, learning plausible goals, internalising action scripts, and storing expectancies. At the same time, you are also collecting the experiences necessary to simulate action scripts in your head.\nKlein mentions that RPD is similar to other models of expertise, such as Lee Beach and Terry Mitchell (a) on image theory, the skills-rules-knowledge scheme (a) by Jens Rasmussen, and other models of expertise by P. A. Anderson (a), Wohl (a), and Dreyfus and Dreyfus (a). According to Klein (Sources of Power, Chapter 7), RPD\u0026rsquo;s contribution is merely that:\nIt appears to describe the decision strategy used most frequently by people with experience. It explains how people can use experience to make difficult decisions. It demonstrates that people can make effective decisions without using a rational choice strategy.

Let\u0026rsquo;s also say that you agree that tacit knowledge is mostly learnt through emulation, apprenticeship and osmosis.\nThe question that follows naturally is this: are there ways to get better at it? Is there research that tells us how to get better at emulation, or to be more effective at apprenticeship? I mentioned in my previous piece that the field of Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) [Naturalistic decision making] is the most promising subfield of expertise research I\u0026rsquo;ve found; I also mentioned that learning ideas and methods from NDM has made the biggest difference in my own pursuit of mastery.\nTwo caveats Let\u0026rsquo;s take a quick tour of all the ways \u0026rsquo;tacit knowledge\u0026rsquo; is confusing, just so you know that I am skipping over large parts of the philosophical literature:\nTacit knowledge may be \u0026rsquo;embodied\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; that is, activities like riding a bike or swinging a tennis racquet have to do with the body, but not necessarily the conscious mind. Some philosophers believe that such skills are a type of tacit knowledge that is different from the tacit knowledge in more cerebral fields like programming and designing and writing. (I do not believe this is true, but the philosophical argument for why they believe this is the case will take around 50 pages of writing, so we\u0026rsquo;re not going to go there). Many types of tacit knowledge may be made explicit: for instance, bike riding or ball kicking may be turned into a collection of physics equations in a research paper. This is a form of explicit knowledge, and it may help you build a bike-riding or ball-kicking robot. But from a pedagogical perspective, this form of explicit knowledge is useless: it won\u0026rsquo;t help you learn to ride a bike or kick a ball. So is this really tacit knowledge? Or is it explicit? Or is it a bit of both? What about the kinds of tacit knowledge that can be communicated via video, or through pictures? I may not be able to explain to you how to do a complicated series of yoga poses through words alone, but if I record a quick video, or draw a series of diagrams, you might be able to learn to do so. Is such knowledge tacit, or explicit? And how about organisational tacit knowledge? In 1988, Taiichi Ohno published The Toyota Production System, which laid out the ideas behind lean manufacturing for the first time. He did so after resisting codification of those principles for many, many years; Ohno feared that the publication of TPS would destroy Toyota\u0026rsquo;s competitive advantage. But it turned out that the publication of Ohno\u0026rsquo;s book by itself did not lead to widespread adoption amongst Toyota\u0026rsquo;s competitors. More bizarrely, competitors who poached TPS experts away from Toyota were not able to replicate Toyota\u0026rsquo;s system in their company. It appeared that TPS required an organisational culture to develop alongside the implementation of the system itself. This phenomenon sparked off an entire subfield of research into organisational tacit knowledge. I\u0026rsquo;ll skip ahead here and tell you that none of these questions are particularly interesting to me \u0026mdash; at least, not in the context of this blog. This blog is a practitioner\u0026rsquo;s blog: it is interested in what is useful, not what is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;. [\u0026hellip;]\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s my way of side-stepping everything above: when I say tacit knowledge in this series, what I am really interested in is \u0026rsquo;expert intuition\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;expert judgment\u0026rsquo;. This is the \u0026ldquo;expertise, full of caveats\u0026rdquo; that I talked about in Part 1 (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinWhyTacitKnowledgeMoreImportantDeliberatePractice2020) ]. Expert intuition is tacit because it is incredibly difficult to investigate, incredibly difficult to make explicit, and incredibly difficult to teach.\nHow the naturalistic decision makers do it [\u0026hellip;] \u0026lsquo;Cognitive Task Analysis\u0026rsquo; (CTA) [Cognitive task analysis]\n[\u0026hellip;] a set of interviewing techniques designed to explicate tacit mental models of expertise. This is not an easy task. An earlier version of this was called the \u0026lsquo;Critical Decision Method\u0026rsquo; [Critical decision method], which focused on \u0026rsquo;tough cases\u0026rsquo; of expertise-driven performance, in order to elicit whatever it is that was going on in the practitioners\u0026rsquo;s heads. Today, the set of techniques is much larger, and they are all lumped together under the umbrella of CTA.\nIf you study the development of psych approaches, CTA is simply an extension of older techniques used by the behaviourists to analyse psychological effects under experimental conditions. (Paul Harmon, for instance, talks about this evolution here (a)). NDM researchers typically perform cognitive task analysis at the outset of their projects \u0026mdash; this is how they extract tacit knowledge from the experts they study.\n[\u0026hellip;] a model of expert intuition called the recognition-primed decision making model (RPD) [Recognition-primed decision making model].\nThis model, developed by Gary Klein and his collaborators in the 90s, lies at the heart of their understanding of expert intuition. RPD explains how expert intuition works, and it tells us why experts have so much difficulty when it comes to explaining their expertise. NDM practitioners use the RPD model as a guide during their interviewing process, and they also use it as a guide to the development of their training programs.\nNDM researchers develop training programs designed to let less experienced practitioners acquire expert judgment of their own. NDM practitioners typically have some familiarity with pedagogical techniques, but in this, they, too, are guided by the RPD model.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a common misconception to look at this and think: \u0026ldquo;oh, when you can make tacit knowledge explicit, then you can just explain things to people and they will get it.\u0026rdquo; This is not the right conclusion to have. As we shall soon see, large portions of expertise is tacit, and for certain types of expertise, the training methods must also be tacit in nature \u0026mdash; that is, built around copying, and emulation, and scenario training, not explicit instruction. What NDM gives us is a rigorous method to reason about such things.\n[formatting mine]\nThe Recognition-primed decision making model See Recognition-primed decision.\nHow do we use RPD? See How to improve at Recognition-primed decision making?\nHow do we know this model is accurate? One question that you might reasonably ask is: how do we know that the RPD model is true? I\u0026rsquo;ve described NDM\u0026rsquo;s methods to you, and you might have caught on to the fact that none of what I\u0026rsquo;ve described is experimental. NDM researchers do not use hypothesis testing; there is no concept of falsifiability in their work. Klein himself readily admits that NDM is \u0026ldquo;nearer to anthropology than psychology.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn the two decades since Sources of Power was first published, NDM has only become more established as a field of research. More militaries around the world are using NDM methods to extract tacit models of expertise from their best operators, in order to turn that knowledge into training programs; Nasdaq uses (a) NDM researchers to design user interfaces to augment the expertise of experienced fraud investigators on their staff. Klein himself wrote a famous paper (a) [Daniel Kahneman, Gary Klein | Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree] with Daniel Kahneman on the situations where expert intuition was valid, and where it might not be valid. Most interestingly, Robert Hoffman, an NDM pioneer and one of the co-authors of the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance (a), [K. Anders Ericsson, Robert Hoffman, Aaron Kozbelt, A. Mark Williams | The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance] has spent a good part of the last decade working on an epistemology (a) [Naturalistic Decision Making | Robert Hoffman] for the entire field.\nThese are all signs, I think, that NDM captures something true about the world. But be that as it may, I believe that this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be of much consideration to you, if you simply want to use this for your career.\nI have argued elsewhere that if you are primarily a practitioner, your epistemology should be different than if you were a scientist (a) [Cedric Chin | A Personal Epistemology of Practice] If you are a scientist, you will want to know what is true by the standards of scientific truth \u0026mdash; this typically means successful replication over a number of years, culminating in meta-analyses of multiple randomised controlled trials with sufficient statistical power. But if you are a practitioner, what you want to do is to learn what can be useful to you today, in the pursuit of your goals. Your evaluation of an idea should be structured around whether the idea works for you \u0026mdash; which is a different bar for truth compared to that of the scientist\u0026rsquo;s.\nNDM lies at the highest level in my hierarchy of practical evidence (a) [Cedric Chin | The Hierarchy of Practical Evidence]: I have tried their methods and their ideas in my life, and nearly every one of them have led to improvements.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chinWhyTacitKnowledgeMoreImportantDeliberatePractice2020 NO_ITEM_DATA:chinCopyingBetterHowAcquireTacitKnowledgeExperts2020 Backlinks Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/5a1426bf-c14f-411b-af3e-e21ee56fa8e5/","summary":"Cedric Chin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinCopyingBetterHowAcquireTacitKnowledgeExperts2020)\nSummary We can acquire the Tacit knowledge of experts through Naturalistic decision making: Cognitive task analysis and Recognition-primed decision.\nThoughts Notes Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you believe tacit knowledge exists.

And if you see B, then do P. But if you see A and C but not B, then do Q, because reason D.

[\u0026hellip;] like music and math and chess\u0026rdquo;.\nThoughts Notes What is tacit knowledge? See Tacit knowledge.\nThink about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you\u0026rsquo;re doing when you\u0026rsquo;re cycling, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be of much help when you\u0026rsquo;re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you\u0026rsquo;re telling them to \u0026ldquo;BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!\u0026rdquo;.\nUndoubtedly there will be people who say that if you just explain better, if you could find the right words to talk to your students, you can teach them to ride bikes. If you happen to believe this … well, I urge you to test this theory yourself. Go find a couple of kids (or adults!) who haven\u0026rsquo;t yet learned to ride a bike and see if you can teach them \u0026mdash; through the power of your explanations alone! \u0026mdash; how to cycle without scraping their shins. And if you are successful, be critical with yourself: how much of your success is due to the bike rider figuring it out on their own? And how much of it is due to your verbal instructions?\nThis explanation bit deserves some attention. In pedagogy, this is known as \u0026lsquo;transmissionism (a)\u0026rsquo;, and it is regarded amongst serious educators with the same sort of derision you and I might have about flat-earth theories today. It goes something like this: some people believe that it is possible to teach technique by explaining things to others. They think that if you can find just the right combinations of words with the right sorts of analogies; if you can really break things down into the right level of atomic details, things will magically click in their students\u0026rsquo;s heads and they will succeed. [\u0026hellip;]\nHow do you teach tacit knowledge? How do you teach bike riding, for that matter?\nWhen I was a kid, I taught myself how to ride a bike … by accident. And then I taught my sisters and then my cousin and then another kid in the neighbourhood who was interested but a little scared. They were zooming around in about an hour each. The steps were as follows:\nPick a small bike, much smaller than the body of your learner, and therefore not far off the ground. This is useful for the learner because they will be able to put their feet down and save themselves at any moment. It\u0026rsquo;s also less scary to be not far off the ground. Have them push with their legs and go forward a short distance, again with their feet only inches off the ground. Do this repeatedly, by pushing off, putting both feet down, then stopping and repeating. Make the pushes harder and the distances longer. Eventually, they will spend tens of seconds gliding with their feet held up. The goal here is have them learn how it feels like to balance on a bike. On one of those glides, once they feel ready (and likely a little bored \u0026mdash; the point is to get them to do step 3 so many times that they\u0026rsquo;re feeling secure and eager to move on) \u0026mdash; well, once you reach that point, tell them to start peddling. Voilà. You have a bicycling kid. Notice how little verbal instruction is involved. What is more important is emulation, and action \u0026mdash; that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.\nIn other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.\nTacit knowledge in knowledge work In my previous job, my technical lead, Hieu, had an uncanny ability to sit in on requirements meetings and, within minutes, sketch out a program structure that would be the simplest possible solution with the fewest moving parts. That sketch was often the one we ended up implementing, and yet I noticed that Hieu always left enough wiggle room for the inevitable changes that came with any software project. (To be clear, he usually implemented a throwaway prototype to confirm the sketch, before passing on the design). When I designed implementations, something always had to be redesigned later. I simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good. Eventually, I asked him how he did this, and tried multiple times to get it out of him over the years we worked together. Our conversations would inevitably go something like the following:\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026rdquo; Hieu would begin, \u0026ldquo;When you hear there is an external API, you should focus your program around that because there is a lot of risk there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah but then why didn\u0026rsquo;t you worry about the calendar API?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, because I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with it before and I think it is easy to implement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why focus so much on Firebase?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because we want to use it as a database layer. Quite risky ah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So always focus on a core layer first, because more important?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes. Try to focus on the most dangerous bits first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But how come you didn\u0026rsquo;t worry about the inventory API? We\u0026rsquo;ve never integrated with that before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ya that one not that important now I think. The client might change it later. Or maybe our feature is going to change. We do the basics first.\u0026rdquo;\nI thought back to my Viki days, when I was a software engineering intern and was writing software tests for the first time. A senior software engineer took a few seconds to look at about a hundred lines of code I\u0026rsquo;d written, and said \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not good, this would be a problem later. Structure it this way.\u0026rdquo;\nI asked him how he knew, within five seconds, that it was bad. He gave me a long explanation about software engineering principles. I waved him away and asked how he did it in five seconds. He said \u0026ldquo;Well, it just felt right. Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s go to lunch, you can fix it afterwards.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve written about this Viki episode in my post about perceptual learning. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to say that Hieu or the senior software engineer couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain their judgment, or that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t make explicit the principles they used to evaluate the tradeoffs between a dozen or so variables: they could, even if terribly. My point is that their explanations would not lead me to the same ability that they had.\nWhy is this the case? Well, take a look at the conversation again. When I pushed these people on their judgments, they would try to explain in terms of principles or heuristics. But the more I pushed, the more exceptions and caveats and potential gotchas I unearthed.\nThis is actually generalisable. People with expertise in any sufficiently complicated domain will always explain their expertise with things like: \u0026ldquo;Well, do X. Except when you see Y, then do Z, because A. And if you see B, then do P. But if you see A and C but not B, then do Q, because reason D. And then there are weird situations where you do Z but then see thing C emerge, then you should switch to Q.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd if you push further, eventually they might say \u0026ldquo;Ahh, it just feels right. Do it long enough and it\u0026rsquo;ll feel right to you too.\u0026rdquo;\nEventually I realised that the way to learn Hieu\u0026rsquo;s techniques was to copy him: to design some software and then ask for his feedback. And I realised that if you ever hear someone explaining things in terms of a long list of caveats, the odds are good that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at tacit knowledge in action.\nThis phenomenon is actually well established in the study of expertise. It has also been written about, many times, by practitioners in other fields. As an example, here\u0026rsquo;s surgeon Atul Gawande on appendicitis surgery:\nSay you\u0026rsquo;ve got a patient who needs surgery for appendicitis. These days, surgeons will typically do a laparoscopic appendectomy. You slide a small camera—a laparoscope—into the abdomen through a quarter-inch incision near the belly button, insert a long grasper through an incision beneath the waistline, and push a device for stapling and cutting through an incision in the left lower abdomen. Use the grasper to pick up the finger-size appendix, fire the stapler across its base and across the vessels feeding it, drop the severed organ into a plastic bag, and pull it out. Close up, and you\u0026rsquo;re done. That\u0026rsquo;s how you like it to go, anyway. But often it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nEven before you start, you need to make some judgments. Unusual anatomy, severe obesity, or internal scars from previous abdominal surgery could make it difficult to get the camera in safely; you don\u0026rsquo;t want to poke it into a loop of intestine. You have to decide which camera-insertion method to use—there\u0026rsquo;s a range of options—or whether to abandon the high-tech approach and do the operation the traditional way, with a wide-open incision that lets you see everything directly. If you do get your camera and instruments inside, you may have trouble grasping the appendix. Infection turns it into a fat, bloody, inflamed worm that sticks to everything around it—bowel, blood vessels, an ovary, the pelvic sidewall—and to free it you have to choose from a variety of tools and techniques. You can use a long cotton-tipped instrument to try to push the surrounding attachments away. You can use electrocautery, a hook, a pair of scissors, a sharp-tip dissector, a blunt-tip dissector, a right-angle dissector, or a suction device. You can adjust the operating table so that the patient\u0026rsquo;s head is down and his feet are up, allowing gravity to pull the viscera in the right direction. Or you can just grab whatever part of the appendix is visible and pull really hard.\nOnce you have the little organ in view, you may find that appendicitis was the wrong diagnosis. It might be a tumor of the appendix, Crohn\u0026rsquo;s disease, or an ovarian condition that happened to have inflamed the nearby appendix. Then you\u0026rsquo;d have to decide whether you need additional equipment or personnel—maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to enlist another surgeon.\nOver time, you learn how to head off problems, and, when you can\u0026rsquo;t, you arrive at solutions with less fumbling and more assurance. After eight years, I\u0026rsquo;ve performed more than two thousand operations. Three-quarters have involved my specialty, endocrine surgery—surgery for endocrine organs such as the thyroid, the parathyroid, and the adrenal glands. The rest have involved everything from simple biopsies to colon cancer. For my specialized cases, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to know most of the serious difficulties that could arise, and have worked out solutions. For the others, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained confidence in my ability to handle a wide range of situations, and to improvise when necessary.\nNotice how Gawande includes all sorts of caveats in his explanation of his expertise. This is probably tacit knowledge in action. Learning this type of complicated judgment — this instantaneous solution selection that happens to balance dozens of considerations against each other — this is what is valuable to learn. And it is almost impossible to learn it through explanation alone.\nCan tacit knowledge be made explicit? It is worth it to re-examine that last sentence, above. Could it \u0026mdash; in principle \u0026mdash; be possible to externalise tacit knowledge into a list of instructions? [\u0026hellip;]\nThe consensus answer to that question seems to be: \u0026ldquo;Yes, in principle it is possible to do so. In practice it is very difficult.\u0026rdquo; My take on this is that it is so difficult that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even bother; assuming that you are reading this because you want to get good in your career, you should give up on turning tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and just go after tacit knowledge itself.\nWhy do we know this?\nIn the 1970s, a bunch of organisations \u0026mdash; amongst them the US military \u0026mdash; commissioned a number of studies to look into the possibility of building out all sorts of expert systems to augment or replace human agents. [\u0026hellip;]\nWhat many researchers found in the wake of that fad was that it is extremely difficult to encode all the possible branches and gotchas and nuances from a human expert into an expert system.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n(Wikipedia calls this problem the \u0026lsquo;knowledge acquisition problem (a)\u0026rsquo;, which is a nice way of putting it; it was what ultimately caused expert systems to decline in popularity). As people rapidly discovered, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so easy to get the \u0026lsquo;rules\u0026rsquo; out of experts\u0026rsquo;s heads in the first place.\nBut there are other objections, of course. Klein \u0026mdash; now considered one of the pioneers of the Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) [Naturalistic decision making] branch of psychology \u0026mdash; likes to say that over-reliance on procedures makes human operators fragile (Chapter 15, Source of Power (a)). In other words, giving people a list of procedures to execute, blindly [or via Learned blankness], denies them the ability to build expertise, which in turns prevents them from doing the sorts of creative problem solving that is common amongst expert operators. It also means that when something goes drastically wrong \u0026mdash; and something always goes drastically wrong in the real world \u0026mdash; they would not be able to adapt.\nLearning tacit knowledge \u0026ldquo;But wait,\u0026rdquo; I hear you say \u0026mdash; \u0026ldquo;What about the field of deliberate practice? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the predominant subfield most concerned with the development of expertise?\u0026rdquo; And the answer to that is no, it is not.\nIn my review of Ericssons\u0026rsquo; Peak (a) [ TODO: Add citation for peak. ], and in my summary of The Problems with Deliberate Practice (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinBookSummaryPeakNewScienceExpertise2019) ], I explained that deliberate practice is defined as possible only in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice can only exist in fields like music and math and chess.\nAnders Ericsson lays out this narrow definition in Peak, and then does a cop-out, arguing that while he hasn\u0026rsquo;t studied practice outside of such domains, the ideas from deliberate practice may be applied to pedagogically less established fields. But Ericsson is well aware that NDM methods exist \u0026mdash; he was one of the editors, alongside many names from the NDM community \u0026mdash; who worked on the Cambridge Handbook for Expertise and Expert Performance (a). And so if you are a programmer, or designer, or businessperson, an investor or a writer reading about deliberate practice, you may be asking: \u0026ldquo;Well, what about my field? What if there are no established pedagogical techniques for me?\u0026rdquo; And if you have started to ask this question, then you have begun travelling a more interesting path; this is really the right question to ask.\nThe answer, of course, is that the field of NDM is a lot more useful if you find yourself in one of these fields. The process of learning tacit knowledge looks something like the following: you find a master, you work under them for a few years, and you learn the ropes through emulation, feedback, and osmosis \u0026mdash; not through deliberate practice. (Think: Warren Buffett and the years he spent under Benjamin Graham, for instance). The field of NDM is focused on ways to make this practice more effective. And I think much of the world pays too much attention to deliberate practice and to cognitive bias research, and not enough to tacit knowledge acquisition.\nIf tacit knowledge exists \u0026mdash; and I believe it does \u0026mdash; then the most useful tools about skill acquisition will come out of the fields that study it. Late last year, the NDM community got together and published The Oxford Handbook of Expertise (a). It is the single most comprehensive overview of the field that we know today.\nAdd citation for peak Cite Cambridge handbook for expertise and expert performance Cite oxford handbook of expertise Bibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chinBookSummaryPeakNewScienceExpertise2019 NO_ITEM_DATA:chinWhyTacitKnowledgeMoreImportantDeliberatePractice2020 Backlinks Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/bcba3e46-9cde-4555-accb-ec73e4f0fc4c/","summary":"Cedric Chin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinWhyTacitKnowledgeMoreImportantDeliberatePractice2020)\nSummary An essay on Tacit knowledge and Deliberate practice\nTacit knowledge is more useful than deliberate practice when the subject you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;well defined\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; deliberate practice is defined as possible only in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy.

We may not be able to accelerate expertise. It may take, let\u0026rsquo;s say, ten years for someone to become an expert despite our acceleration efforts (see accelerated proficiency curve in notes below). What doesn\u0026rsquo;t work? Establish and a skill hierarchy composed of atomised skills/techniques Teach the skills in a classroom-like setting Include some form of testing to measure learning Generally speaking: the typical classroom Pedagogy Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it work? It\u0026rsquo;s slow; both to create and to update Learners are prone to develop understandings, Mental models, with subtle flaws. These flaws prevent the acquisition of a fully-true mental model. Atomised understanding doesn\u0026rsquo;t generalize to real-world ability; The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something Learners may not internalize the ways in which the atomic skills they were taught fit together (e.g. learning the names of ten cities in France but not being able to find them on a map) What works? Identify the domain experts\nPerform cognitive task analysis [Cognitive task analysis] on these identified experts to extract their expertise\nAs you do step 2, you will be building a case library of difficult cases. Store these cases, and code them according to measures of difficulty.\nTurn your case library into a set of training simulations\nThis step is a bit of an art \u0026mdash; the researchers say that \u0026rsquo;no set of generalised principles currently exist for designing a good simulation\u0026rsquo;. They know that cognitive fidelity to the real world is key \u0026mdash; but how good must the fidelity be? Training programs here span from full virtual simulations (using VR headsets) to pen-and-paper decision making exercises (called Tactical Decision-making Games) employed by the Marines.\nSome training programs are designed so that learners are required to perform sensemaking on their own \u0026mdash; that is, to introspect and reflect on what they\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from each simulation. Others include feedback from a more experienced practitioner, or one that has been identified as an \u0026rsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; in step 1.\nSome training programs may present abstract or generalised principles up front, which are then emphasised through training simulation. For instance, the Marines have a heuristic for when battlefield plans break down: \u0026ldquo;keep moving, seek the high ground, stay in touch.\u0026rdquo; This is taught explicitly.\nFeedback in simulation training is sometimes qualitative and multi-factorial. Some exercises like Gary Klein\u0026rsquo;s Shadowbox method ask multiple-choice question at critical decision points during a presented scenario (e.g., \u0026lsquo;at this point of the cardiac arrest (freeze-frame the video), what cues do you consider important?\u0026rsquo;). Learners then compare their answers to an experts\u0026rsquo;s, and then reflect on what they missed. Other forms of feedback are less clear-cut. US Marine Tactical Decision-making Games are conducted on pen-and-paper in a group environment, with one or two more experienced commanders. Feedback is organic and emerges from the group discussion. Lia DiBello\u0026rsquo;s Strategic Rehearsals (a) are performed in a group setting within the business, and simply give participants a list of three questions to discuss after a failed simulation: (1) what went wrong, (2) what we will do differently this time, and (3) how will we know it is working? Sometimes this is paired with a constructive exercise, facilitated by the trainers.\nTest the program: run your learners through your set of training simulations, ranging from simple to difficult\n[paraphrased, formatting mine]\nWhy does it work? Cognitive flexibility theory Cognitive transformation theory Thoughts Notes This is a summary of a remarkable 🌳 tree book (a) [Tree book], which presents a theory for and methods to accelerate expertise in real-world contexts. This summary is not comprehensive; it only covers some of the actionable theories and recommendations in the book and leaves out the considerable lit review and the book\u0026rsquo;s recommendations for future research directions. I\u0026rsquo;ll note that Accelerated Expertise (a) is not written for the lay person \u0026mdash; it is a book primarily written for organisational psychologists, training program designers and researchers employed in the US military. If you must read it \u0026mdash; say because you want to put the ideas in the book to practice \u0026mdash; my recommendation is to read Chapters 9-13 and skim everything else.\nAccelerated Expertise is about \u0026rsquo;taking the concept of skill development to the limit\u0026rsquo;. This is not a book about pure theory; nor is this a book about deliberate practice (a) in well-developed skill domains. No: this is a book that pushes the limits of two lesser-known learning theories, and in so doing have created successful accelerated training programs in messy, real-world military and industrial contexts.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the US Air Force Research Laboratory convened a series of working meetings on \u0026lsquo;accelerated expertise and facilitated retention\u0026rsquo;, and invited a number of Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) researchers, expertise researchers, and military organisational psychologists to attend. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe report (a) that come out of those meetings became the precursor to Accelerated Expertise (a) [\u0026hellip;]\nAccelerated Expertise is divided into three parts. Part 1 presents a literature review of the entire expertise research landscape circa 2016. Part 2 presents several demonstrations of successful accelerated training programs, and then an underlying theory for why those training programs work so well. Part 2 also contains a generalised structure for creating these accelerated expertise training programs. Part 3 presents a research agenda for the future, and unifies Parts 1 and 2 by pointing out all the holes in the empirical base on which existing accelerated training programs have been built.\nThis summary will focus on Part 2.\nWhat the military wanted The military wanted two things:\nIt wanted new training methods and learning technologies that could accelerate the achievement of high levels of proficiency. (Note: proficiency is different from expertise \u0026mdash; we\u0026rsquo;ll return to this in a moment). It wanted high retention of knowledge and skill. This latter requirement was due to the organisational nature of the military \u0026mdash; it is common for military personnel to be temporarily reassigned to administrative duty for a few years in the middle of active service. For example, an Air Force pilot might be reassigned to teaching duty at an academy for a year or two before returning to the field. The Department of Defence wanted to reduce the amount of retraining necessary to get these pilots up to speed. It tasked researchers to come up with new methods or new research agendas for these problems. Over the course of the two meetings, it became clear that the requirements from the military could be broken down into four granular subgoals, all of which were important for both military and for industry applications:\nMethods to quicken the training process while maintaining its effectiveness (Rapidised Training). Methods to rapidise the transposition of lessons learnt from the battlespace into the training context \u0026mdash; for instance, if insurgents evolve their tactics, there should be a way to rapidly integrate this \u0026lsquo;meta (a)\u0026rsquo; [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinGetGoodGoMetagame2020) ] into existing training programs. (Rapidised Knowledge Sharing). Methods to train more quickly to higher levels of proficiency (Accelerated Proficiency) and Methods to insure that training has a stable and lasting effect (Facilitated Retention) The training approach that they present in Part 2 of the book fulfil many of the four requirements above.\nThe reason there is a difference between \u0026lsquo;proficiency\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;expertise\u0026rsquo; is that the authors do not know if it is possible to accelerate \u0026lsquo;high proficiency\u0026rsquo; (sometimes called \u0026lsquo;mastery\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026rsquo;expertise\u0026rsquo;). In their report, the authors write:\nThe goal of accelerated learning calls out an important practical tension. On the one hand is the notion that we must accelerate learning; that is, increase the rate at which highly proficient performance is achieved. On the other hand, there is a significant amount of evidence that developing expertise requires up to 10 years of experience, including practice at tough tasks (Hoffman, 1998 (a)). This suggests that it is not possible to accelerate the achievement of high proficiency. A prime goal of the DoD Accelerated Learning Technology Focus Team is to identify critical research challenges that are currently underfunded or not funded, and generate a notional roadmap for science and technology advancement.\nThey conclude, tentatively, that perhaps it is only possible to accelerate proficiency between senior apprentice and junior journeyman levels (or between senior journeyman and junior expert levels). They present the following stylised growth curve:\nPerhaps, the authors say, overall mastery still takes 10 years in the field, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do about that.\nBut what we do know is this: the set of successful accelerated training programs that currently exist enable accelerated proficiency, not accelerated mastery.\nAnd perhaps that is good enough!\nHow to accelerate expertise? Let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that you are a training program designer. You need to get a bunch of novices to competency in a short amount of time. What would you do?\nMost of us would first ask: what is the skill tree for this domain? To which the researchers say: No. Stop. Screw all of that.\nI think most of us would first ask: what is the skill tree for this domain? We would attempt to figure out a set of atomised skills and lay them out from the most basic skills to the most advanced, and then design a training syllabus to teach each skill in the right order, making sure to teach the pre-requisites first, and then incrementally complexify our taught concepts and skills and training programs. We would probably also design exercises for the lower levels of skills, and attempt to create intermediate assessment tasks or \u0026rsquo;tests\u0026rsquo;.\nWe would, in short, attempt to replicate how we are taught in school.\nThe researchers say: No. Stop. Screw all of that.\nThere are a number of problems with this training approach. You might be familiar with some of them.\nFirst, this approach to training just takes too damn long. It is, after all, the mainstream approach to pedagogy [Pedagogy], and it is this very paradigm that the researchers were asked to improve. A more interesting question is why it takes too damn long. There are two answers to this question. First, humans learn by constructing mental models [Mental model] of a domain. In the beginning, these mental models are crude and do not result in effective action. So novices evolve them rapidly by constructing, discarding, and re-constructing mental models in response to feedback. At some point, however, these mental models become effective enough and complex enough that they become knowledge shields (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinHardThingLearningExperience2021) ] \u0026mdash; that is, mental models of a domain that are wrong in subtle ways, that prevent students from reaching higher levels of expertise because they enable them to reject anomalous data. In other words, breaking a skill domain down to atomised skills is risky \u0026mdash; it is likely that you will accidentally cause the construction of subtly wrong mental models, due to the incomplete nature of a skill hierarchy. This then slows expertise development, since trainers would now have to do additional work \u0026mdash; for instance, you would have to design your training tasks to include \u0026lsquo;knowledge shield destruction\u0026rsquo; as a pedagogical goal. Better to avoid this completely. Breaking a skill domain down into a discrete learning hierarchy is bad for one other reason: experts are able to see connections and draw links between concepts or cues that novices cannot. Teaching atomised concepts will prevent novices from learning these connections, and may in fact result in either subpar performance or a training plateau later on. (Note: this is not a universal recommendation; the authors note that The Simplifying Conditions Method, as demonstrated by Kim \u0026amp; Reigeluth is one way to break a domain down while emphasising connections between concepts, but this pedagogical method is not universally known. Better to do without this requirement altogether). The second reason a hierarchical training approach sucks is that assessments for atomised skills do not translate to assessments of real world performance. I think we know this intuitively. Tests for basic skills often do not capture the nuances of skill application in real world environments. You can test well in corporate finance and then run a company to the ground, because you do not know what cues to look for in the particular business you\u0026rsquo;re in. The third reason this training approach sucks is that atomised training often does not have high cognitive fidelity to the context of use. Take, for instance, \u0026lsquo;Cognitive Load Theory\u0026rsquo;. This is a famous theory of classroom learning, and it basically says that \u0026lsquo;intrinsic cognitive load\u0026rsquo; is related to the complexity of the learning task itself; \u0026rsquo;extraneous cognitive load\u0026rsquo; is caused by activities during learning that are unnecessary and interfere with schema acquisition. The teacher\u0026rsquo;s job is to design teaching methods that reduce extraneous cognitive load. The authors point out that this is all well and good when your student needs to take a test, but if your work environment involves bombs dropping on you while you plan your troop movements, perhaps your training program should also include some \u0026rsquo;extraneous cognitive load\u0026rsquo;? The fourth reason this training approach sucks is that it is not easy to update the training program if the skill domain changes. This is an important requirement in both business and in military contexts \u0026mdash; you might imagine that if the market environment changes (in business), or if insurgents evolve their IED (a) tactics, you would need to quickly update your training program. But a hierarchical syllabus resists updating. Which lesson do you update? At what level of complexity? What pre-requisites must change? There are too many moving parts. It should be easier to update training. Meanwhile, soldiers get deployed to the frontlines without updated training and die. The fifth reason this training approach sucks is that external assessments often degrade the learner\u0026rsquo;s ability to sensemake in the field. In other words, extremely clear feedback sometimes prevents students from learning effectively from experience (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinHardThingLearningExperience2021) ], which may slow their learning when they arrive in a real world domain. So what do you do? What do you do if you can\u0026rsquo;t design a hierarchical skill tree? What do you do if incremental complexification is off the table?\nThe answer: you cheat.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve talked about the Naturalistic Decision Making branch of psychology in the past. The NDM field contains methods to extract tacit mental models of expertise. These methods are loosely categorised under the name \u0026lsquo;cognitive task analysis\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;CTA\u0026rsquo;, and have been developed over a 30 year period in applied domains. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about NDM in my tacit knowledge series (a) [ (Chin 2020) ], and I\u0026rsquo;ve written about ACTA, the simplest form of CTA here (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinEasierMethodExtractingTacitKnowledge2021) ] and here (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinJohnCutlerProductOrgExpertise2021) ]. I recommend that you read them both.\nOnce you have an explicated mental model of the expertise you desire, you may ask a simpler question: what kind of simulations may I design to provoke the construction of those mental models in the heads of my students?\nWhat CTA allows you to do is to extract the actual mental model of expertise that experts have in their heads. This allows you to sidestep the problem of good hierarchical skill tree design. Once you have an explicated mental model of the expertise you desire, you may ask a simpler question: what kind of simulations may I design to provoke the construction of those mental models in the heads of my students?\nThis core insight underpins many of the successful accelerated expertise training programs in use today.\nWith that in mind, this is the general structure of an accelerated expertise training program, as recommended by the book:\nIdentify who the domain experts are. The book gives you four methods for expert identification \u0026mdash; (1) in depth career interviews about education, training and job experiences, (2) professional standards or licensing, (3) measures of actual performance at familiar tasks, and finally (4) social interaction analysis (asking groups of practitioners who is a master at what). Perform cognitive task analysis on these identified experts to extract their expertise. Depending on the exact CTA method you use, this step will initially take a few months, and require multiple interviews with multiple experts (and also with some novices) in order to perform good extraction. As you do step 2, you will be building a case library of difficult cases. Store these cases, and code them according to measures of difficulty. You may ask experts to help you with the coding. Next, turn your case library into a set of training simulations. This step is a bit of an art \u0026mdash; the researchers say that \u0026rsquo;no set of generalised principles currently exist for designing a good simulation\u0026rsquo;. They know that cognitive fidelity to the real world is key \u0026mdash; but how good must the fidelity be? Training programs here span from full virtual simulations (using VR headsets) to pen-and-paper decision making exercises (called Tactical Decision-making Games) employed by the Marines. Some training programs are designed so that learners are required to perform sensemaking on their own \u0026mdash; that is, to introspect and reflect on what they\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from each simulation. Others include feedback from a more experienced practitioner, or one that has been identified as an \u0026rsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; in step 1. Some training programs may present abstract or generalised principles up front, which are then emphasised through training simulation. For instance, the Marines have a heuristic for when battlefield plans break down: \u0026ldquo;keep moving, seek the high ground, stay in touch.\u0026rdquo; This is taught explicitly. Finally, test the program: run your learners through your set of training simulations, ranging from simple to difficult. This also requires some amount of tweaking \u0026mdash; the authors note that \u0026lsquo;difficulty\u0026rsquo; in a domain is complex, and it may take some trial and error to figure out a good ordering of cases, or a good categorisation scheme (more advanced learners should be assigned more difficult cases, or you risk constructing or reinforcing knowledge shields). Feedback in simulation training is sometimes qualitative and multi-factorial. Some exercises like Gary Klein\u0026rsquo;s Shadowbox method ask multiple-choice question at critical decision points during a presented scenario (e.g., \u0026lsquo;at this point of the cardiac arrest (freeze-frame the video), what cues do you consider important?\u0026rsquo;). Learners then compare their answers to an experts\u0026rsquo;s, and then reflect on what they missed. Other forms of feedback are less clear-cut. US Marine Tactical Decision-making Games are conducted on pen-and-paper in a group environment, with one or two more experienced commanders. Feedback is organic and emerges from the group discussion. Lia DiBello\u0026rsquo;s Strategic Rehearsals (a) are performed in a group setting within the business, and simply give participants a list of three questions to discuss after a failed simulation: (1) what went wrong, (2) what we will do differently this time, and (3) how will we know it is working? Sometimes this is paired with a constructive exercise, facilitated by the trainers. We\u0026rsquo;ll get into a real world example in a bit, but I want to call out a few remarkable things about this approach:\nNotice how case libraries and simulations may be easily updated. If the battlespace changes, training program designers that are proficient in CTA may be deployed to the frontlines to do skill extraction, and then return to turn those into additional training simulations. Skill retention is very compatible with this approach \u0026mdash; experienced practitioners may be put on a spaced-repetition program where they do periodic training simulations. Alternatively, if the practitioner is not able to do training simulations (perhaps because they are assigned to a location that is too far away from a training facility), an alternative is to perform \u0026lsquo;over-training\u0026rsquo; \u0026mdash; that is, intensive simulation training right before he or she is reassigned, which results in a more gentle skill drop-off rate. There are two caveats to this: first, spaced repetition has mostly been shown to work for knowledge retention, not skill retention; second, in general, studies tell us that skills tend to be retained for a longer period than knowledge. The authors note that we currently lack a good empirical base for skill retention. Not doing basic skill training seems excessive \u0026mdash; but the authors note that training simulations do not preclude teaching basic skills. A common reaction to this training approach is to say \u0026ldquo;wait, but novices will feel lost and overwhelmed if they have no basic conceptual training and are instead thrown into real world tasks!\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; and this is certainly a valid concern. To be fair, the book\u0026rsquo;s approach may be combined with some form of atomised skill training up front. But it\u0026rsquo;s worth asking if a novice\u0026rsquo;s feeling of artificial progression is actually helpful, if the progression comes at the expense of real world performance. The authors basically shrug this off and say (I\u0026rsquo;m paraphrasing): \u0026ldquo;well, do you want accelerated expertise or not?\u0026rdquo; In more formal learning science terms, this \u0026lsquo;overwhelming\u0026rsquo; feeling is probably best seen as a \u0026lsquo;desirable difficulty (a)\u0026rsquo; [Desirable difficulty], and may be an acceptable price to pay for acceleration. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that sensemaking plays a key part in many of their training programs. Simulation training gives trainers the option of asking students to perform \u0026mdash; and therefore learn from \u0026mdash; sensemaking, instead of seeking explicit feedback. This is not always doable, but is generally a good idea, since skill mastery in real world domains emerges from effective reflection. As such, many training programs guide learners to reflect on dynamic, messy feedback. There are many other interesting ideas that I cannot get into, for the sake of brevity. For instance, one fascinating comment, presented in Chapter 14, is the idea that case libraries may serve as the basis of \u0026lsquo;organisational knowledge management\u0026rsquo;:\nCase experience is so important to the achievement of proficiency that it can be assumed that organisations would need very large case repositories for use in training (and also to preserve organisational memory). Instruction using cases is greatly enhanced when \u0026ldquo;just the right case\u0026rdquo; or set of cases can be engaged at a prime learning moment for a learner (Kolodner, 1993). This also argues for a need for large numbers of cases, to cover many contingencies. Creating and maintaining case libraries is a matter of organisation among cases, good retrieval schemes, and smart indexing\u0026mdash;all so that \u0026ldquo;lessons learned\u0026rdquo; do not become \u0026ldquo;lessons forgotten.\u0026rdquo;\nThe US Marines, for instance, own a large and growing library of \u0026lsquo;Tactical Decision-Making Games\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;TDGs\u0026rsquo;, built from various real or virtual battlefield scenarios; these represent a corpus of the collective operational expertise of the Marines Corps.\nThe authors note that this isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to military applications. Take, for instance, the domain of power generation, where one of the authors was tasked with a project on capturing tacit expertise in a retiring workforce:\nIt is easy to acquire and instil \u0026ldquo;middle of the bell curve\u0026rdquo; knowledge (in an electric utilities company), but at an electric plant there will be, say, five out of 1500 people who are irreplaceable. When (not if) the need arises, much effort is required to transpose high-end technical wisdom to a few specified individuals who are mission-critical in that their value lies at the fringes of some particular discipline (e.g., individuals who keep the company out of the newspaper; individuals who make sure the lights do not go out at Giant Stadium on Monday night). The high-end or \u0026ldquo;franchise experts\u0026rdquo; sometimes change the mission and thereby make the total organization resilient (Hoffman et al., 2011). For example, when a fire started in a relay station building that had lots of asbestos, the expert\u0026rsquo;s novel solution was to seal off the building, flush the insides into one single storm drain and grab the debris from there. The process took a couple of weeks (vs. many weeks), it protected the public and the environment, and it kept the incident out of the newspapers.\nWhile expertise may be acquired in around 10 years, typically it takes 25-35 years to achieve very high-end proficiency. This is related, in part, not just to the frequency of meaningful real-world experiences that could be leveraged to further skill acquisition, but to the complexity of the domain and the longevity of the technology. (For instance, only recently have utilities begun the change from analog controls to digital controls.) Many stories are told of the engineering challenges in New York City. Engineers have to maintain and integrate numerous subsystems built in different eras. A senior relay system protection engineer retired, and was replaced by four engineers, each having had 10 years of experience. That did not suffice. (emphasis added) When a car hit a pole and two lines tripped, both lines were lost. Across the two lines there were dozens of different kinds of relays and dozens of different kinds of relay protection schemes, some 50 years old. The retired engineer had to be brought back in to fix this emergency situation.\nIn other words, what serves as a difficult case library for training may also double as a store of expertise.\nThe underlying theory In Chapter 11, the authors assert that two core learning theories underpin their training approach, and may be combined:\nCognitive Flexibility Theory [Cognitive flexibility theory], or CFT, and Cognitive Transformation Theory [Cognitive transformation theory], or CTT I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about CTT in the past, which you may read about here (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinHardThingLearningExperience2021) ] and here (a) [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinBusinessExpertiseImportanceCognitiveAgility2021) ]. This is the summary of both theories that the book presents:\nPertinent theories related to the acquisition and acceleration of expertise can be thought of as sets of hypotheses or postulates, which could be combined or merged, as we do in the following discussion of Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT) (Spiro et al., 1988, 1992) and Cognitive Transformation Theory (CTT) (Klein, 1997; Klein \u0026amp; Baxter, 2009). These two theories have the greatest relevance to empirical data collected on domains of cognitive work in the \u0026ldquo;real world.\u0026rdquo;\nBecause the two theories share the same core syllogisms, especially around mental model formation and knowledge shields, the researchers argue that they may both be combined. We\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at how they do that in a bit.\nCognitive Flexibility Theory Core syllogism\nLearning is the active construction of conceptual understanding. Training must support the learner in overcoming reductive explanation. Reductive explanation reinforces and preserves itself through misconception networks and through knowledge shields. Advanced learning is the ability to flexibly apply knowledge to cases within the domain. Therefore, instruction by incremental complexification will not be conducive of advanced learning.\nTherefore, advanced learning is promoted by emphasizing the interconnectedness of multiple cases and concepts along multiple dimensions, and the use of multiple, highly organized representations.\nEmpirical ground\nStudies of learning of topics that have conceptual complexity (medical students). Demonstrations of knowledge shields and dimensions of difficulty. Demonstrations that learners tend to oversimplify (reductive bias) by the spurious reduction of complexity. Studies of the value of using multiple analogies. Demonstrations that learners tend to regularise that which is irregular, which leads to failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Demonstrations that learners tend to de-contextualize concepts, which leads to failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Demonstrations that learners tend to take the role of passive recipient versus active participants. Hypothesis that learners tend to rely too much on generic abstractions, which can be too far removed from the specific instances experienced to be apparently applicable to new cases, i.e., failure to transfer knowledge to new cases. Conceptual complexity and case-to-case irregularity pose problems for traditional theories and modes of instruction. Instruction that simplifies and then complicates incrementally can detract from advanced knowledge acquisition by facilitating the formation of reductive understanding and knowledge shields. Instruction that emphasizes recall memory will not contribute to inferential understanding and advanced knowledge acquisition (transfer). Additional propositions in the theory\nAdvanced knowledge acquisition (apprentice-journeyman-expert) depends on the ability to achieve deeper understanding and apply it flexibly. Barriers to advanced learning include complexity, interactions, context-dependence, and illstructuredness (inconsistent patterns of concepts-in-combination). Cognitive flexibility includes the ability to mobilize small, pre-compiled knowledge structures, and this \u0026ldquo;adaptive schema assembly\u0026rdquo; involves integration and updating, rather than just recall. Active \u0026ldquo;assembly of knowledge\u0026rdquo; from different conceptual and case sources is more important in learning (for domains of complexity and ill-structuredness) than retrieval of knowledge structures. Misconceptions compound into networks of misconceptions. Misconceptions of fundamental concepts can cohere in systematic ways, making each misconception easier to believe and harder to change. Representations with high interconnectedness will tend to serve as \u0026ldquo;misconception-disabling correct knowledge.\u0026rdquo; Cognitive flexibility is the ability to represent knowledge from different conceptual and case perspectives and construct from those an adaptive knowledge ensemble tailored to the needs of the problem at hand. [formatting mine]\nCognitive Transformation Theory Core syllogism\nLearning consists of the elaboration and replacement of mental models. Mental models are limited and include knowledge shields. Knowledge shields lead to wrong diagnoses and enable the discounting of evidence. Therefore learning must also involve unlearning.\nEmpirical ground and claims\nStudies of the reasoning of scientists Flawed \u0026ldquo;storehouse\u0026rdquo; memory metaphor and the teaching philosophy it entailed (memorization of facts; practice plus immediate feedback, outcome feedback). Studies of science learning showing how misconceptions lead to error. Studies of scientist and student reactions to anomalous data. Success of \u0026ldquo;cognitive conflict\u0026rdquo; methods at producing conceptual change. Additional propositions in the theory\nMental models are reductive and fragmented, and therefore incomplete and flawed. Learning is the refinement of mental models. Mental models provide causal explanations. Experts have more detailed and more sophisticated mental models than novices. Experts have more accurate causal mental models. Flawed mental models are barriers to learning (knowledge shields). Learning is by sensemaking (discovery, reflection) as well as by teaching. Refinement of mental models entails at least some un-learning (accommodation; restructuring, changes to core concepts). Refinement of mental models can take the form of increased sophistication of a flawed model, making it easier for the learner to explain away inconsistencies or anomalous data. Learning is discontinuous. (Learning advances when flawed mental models are replaced, and is stable when a model is refined and gets harder to disconfirm.) People have a variety of fragmented mental models. \u0026ldquo;Central\u0026rdquo; mental models are causal stories. The emphasis of CFT is on overcoming simplifying mental models. Hence it advises against applying instructional methods that involve progressive complexity. CTT, on the other hand, focuses on strategies, and the learning and unlearning of strategies. The two theories focus on marginally different things:\nCFT and CTT each try to achieve increases in proficiency, but in different ways. For CFT, it is flexibility and for CTT, it is a better mental model, but one that will have to be thrown out later on. CFT does not say what the sweet spot is for flexibility. A learner who over complexifies may not get any traction and might become paralysed. It thus might be considered a \u0026ldquo;lopsided\u0026rdquo; theory, or at least an incomplete one. CFT emphasises the achievement of flexibility whereas CTT emphasises the need for unlearning and relearning. Both theories regard advanced learning as a form of sensemaking (discovery, reflection) and both regard learning as discontinuous; advancing when flawed mental models are replaced, stable when a model is refined and gets harder to disconfirm.\nI recommend reading through the two theories carefully, reflecting on their implications, and perhaps investigating their origins (the paper for CFT is here (a); the paper for CTT found here (a)). The implications of both theories are quite profound, and are expressed in the training approach presented at the heart of Accelerated Expertise. But they may also be found in many of the training approaches found in the NDM world (a).\nBy the middle of Part 2 of the book, the two theories are combined into one core theory, like so:\nThe core syllogism of the CFT-CTT merger\nLearning is the active construction of knowledge; the elaboration and replacement of mental models, causal stories, or conceptual understandings. All mental models are limited. People have a variety of fragmentary and often reductive mental models. Training must support the learner in overcoming reductive explanations. Knowledge shields lead to wrong diagnoses and enable the discounting of evidence. Reductive explanation reinforces and preserves itself through misconception networks and through knowledge shields. Flexible learning involves the interplay of concepts and contextual particulars as they play out within and are influenced by cases of application within a domain. Therefore learning must also involve unlearning and relearning.\nTherefore advanced learning is promoted by emphasising the interconnectedness of multiple cases and concepts along multiple conceptual dimensions, and the use of multiple, highly organised representations.\nOther implications of this theory likely exist. I\u0026rsquo;m still working them out for myself, and I urge you to do the same.\n[formatting mine]\nWrapping up Over the course of seven chapters, the authors take great pain to repeat two lessons again and again:\nThat, first, everything in the expertise literature is difficult to generalise. Some methods work well in some domains but not in others. The ultimate test is in the application: if you attempt to put something to practice, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that the technique is bad. It just means that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for your particular context. The sooner you learn to embrace this, the better. Second, the authors take care to point out that a great many things about training can probably never be known. For instance, it is nearly impossible to isolate the factors that result in successful training in real world contexts — and yet real world contexts is ultimately where we want training to occur. There are simply too many confounding variables. And the truth is that we can\u0026rsquo;t go the other way and run perfectly controlled experiments either — there is a great deal of difficulty getting lab-based or classroom-based training to work. Certainly, the military (and industry!) is interested in what works on the battlefield and in the corporation; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care about what is publishable or testable in controlled classroom environments. The overall picture that I got from the book goes something like this: \u0026ldquo;We know very little about expertise. There are large gaps in our empirical base. (Please, DoD, fund us so we can plug them!) What we do know is messy, because there are a ton of confounding variables. And yet, given that we\u0026rsquo;ve mostly worked in applied domains, our training programs seem to deliver results for businesses and soldiers, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t perfectly understand how they do so. Perhaps this is simply the nature of things in expertise research. We have discovered several things that work — the biggest of which is Cognitive Task Analysis, which enable us to extract actual mental models of expertise. We also have a usable macrocognitive theory of learning. But beyond that — phooey. Perhaps we just have to keep trying things, and check that our learners get better faster, and we can only speculate at why our programs work; we can never know for sure.\u0026rdquo;\nBibliography References Chin, Cedric. 2020. “The Tacit Knowledge Series.” Commoncog. https://commoncog.com/the-tacit-knowledge-series/.

Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.\nLet me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:\n\u0026ldquo;Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,\u0026rdquo; said a meek voce outside the door.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,\u0026rdquo; the Professor said to the children, \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?\u0026rdquo; The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a-doubling so many years, you see,\u0026rdquo; the tailor replied, a little grufy, \u0026ldquo;and I think I\u0026rsquo;d like the money now. It\u0026rsquo;s two thousand pound, it is!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s nothing!\u0026rdquo; the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. \u0026ldquo;But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you\u0026rsquo;d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know as I\u0026rsquo;d care about being a king,\u0026rdquo; the man said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;But it dew sound a powerful sight o\u0026rsquo; money! Well, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll wait-\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course you will!\u0026rdquo; said the Professor. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?\u0026rdquo; Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.\n\u0026ldquo;Never, my child!\u0026rdquo; the Professor replied emphatically. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it\u0026rsquo;s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!\u0026rdquo;\nBibliography References Keynes, John Maynard. 2010. Essays in Persuasion. New ed.

The \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; evolved as a competition training plan designed for continuous improvement, and as something easy to pick up, follow, and understand. The original \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; is an intense training plan based around 6 sessions per week, designed for regular competition and testing. However, it is followed in such a way that you always use previous training sessions to set targets for future sessions, enabling continuous improvement, and allowing even a complete beginner to follow the plan. Jumping straight in to the full volume of 6 sessions a week would be tough for a beginner though, and so the following 24 weeks plan gradually increases the volume, and will introduce you to some of the key training principles for the indoor rower.\nThe 24 week \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; The 24 week training plan set out here is aimed at the beginner to intermediate indoor rower. The training plan is set out in a simple to follow format, with each week containing 3 core sessions, and for the keen trainer, 2 additional optional sessions. See the next section where this training plan is reproduced along with explanations for how to complete each session, and the key aims behind them. As such each week is set out with the 5 workouts, the core workouts first (completed on separate days), followed by the two optional workouts in [square brackets]. The idea here is that you complete the core workouts every week, and when you have the time and motivation you might pick one of the optional workouts on occasional weeks.\nNote: Below this summary of the sessions you will find a full explanation of how to follow each session in the plan, so do scroll down and use those notes as you follow through the sessions. If anything isn\u0026rsquo;t clear to you, please do email me at thepeteplan@gmail.com to ask.\nNote: If even this volume of sessions looks too much, simply halve each session for your first time through the plan and begin with a 2500m row on Day 1, 3 x 500m on Day 2 and so on.\nWeek Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 (optional) Day 5 (optional) 1 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest 5000m 20min 2 x 10min / 2min rest 2 5500m 4 x 750m / 2min rest 5500m 20min 3 x 8min / 2min rest 3 6000m 2 x 2000m / 4min rest 6000m 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest 4 6500m 3 x 1000m / 3min rest 6500m 6000m 2 x 2500m / 2min rest 5 7000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest 7000m 20min 2 x 10min / 2min rest 6 7500m 3 x 2000m / 4min rest 7500m 5000m 6 x 500m / 2min rest 7 8000m 7 x 500m / 2min rest 8000m 6000m 3 x 1500m / 3min rest 8 8500m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 8000m 25min 3 x 1k / 3min rest 9 9000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest 8000m 8000m 2 x 10min / 2min rest 10 9500m 3 x 2000m / 4min rest 8000m 8000m 7 x 500m / 2min rest 11 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 8000m 25mins 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 12 10000m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 8000m 4 x 800m / 2min rest 13 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 8000m 3 x 2k / 4min rest 14 10000m 3 x 2k / 4min rest 4 x 8min / 2min rest 30min 7 x 500m / 2min rest 15 10000m 5 x 750m / 2min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 8000m 4 x 1500m / 3min rest 16 10500m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 17 10500m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 30min 4 x 8min / 2min rest 18 11000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest 30min 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 19 10000m 5 x 800m / 2min rest 3 x 10min / 2min rest 30min 4 x 2k / 4min rest 20 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 21 10000m 4 x 1k / 3min rest 4 x 8min / 2min rest 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 22 12000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest 30min 3 x 10min / 2min rest] 5 x 800m / 2min rest 23 10000m 8 x 500m / 2min rest 2 x 15min / 2min rest 10000m 4 x 2k / 4min rest 24 12000m 5 x 1500m / 3min rest 30min 2 x 15min / 2min rest] 4 x 1k / 3min rest [formatting mine]\nThe 24 week \u0026lsquo;Pete Plan\u0026rsquo; explained Week 1 Day 1: 5000m\nThe three key points you want to concentrate on during all of your erg sessions are technique, relaxation, and efficiency. Use the single distance pieces to work on the different elements of the stroke you read about in the technique section. Aim for a feeling of smooth acceleration through the drive, and to be slow and relaxed during the recovery.\nDay 2: 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nInterval sessions allow you to work at a higher intensity by splitting the workout into smaller segments. Don\u0026rsquo;t get carried away in the early intervals thinking it is easy though, you have many weeks ahead to increase the intensity. As you become more experienced at interval training over the coming weeks you will learn how to pace the different types of session.\nDay 3: 5000m\nLook back at the average pace of your last 5000m session a few days ago. Aim to row at that pace consistently through this session, and don\u0026rsquo;t give in to any temptations to go faster, especially towards the start. Remember \u0026ldquo;technique, relaxation, efficiency\u0026rdquo;.\nDay 4 (optional): 20min\nFirst week and you\u0026rsquo;re already thinking about doing extra sessions? Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not over-doing it early on, rest is a very important part of any training plan. Whether your 5000m sessions have been taking you more or less than 20mins, aim to row this session at a slower pace, concentrating on making each stroke more efficient than the last.\nDay 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\n5 sessions in the first week, you must be keen. Have a go at your first longer interval session. Breaking up the 20min row like this allows you a short break to regain your full concentration, and make sure to take on some water while you can. Row the first 10min at the same pace as your 20min session, and then aim to just beat the distance on the second 10min.\nWeek 2 Day 1: 5500m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see a pattern develop over the first few weeks of your new training plan. These single distance sessions will increase by 500m each week, building the duration gradually up. As your fitness will be increasing each week, and your technique improving, you should find that despite the increase is distance, the pace can be kept the same as the 5000m rows from last week.\nDay 2: 4 x 750m / 2min rest\nThe intervals are 50% longer this week, but the total distance of the session is the same. Look back at your average pace from the 6 x 500m session last week, and try to row each interval at exactly that pace. Don\u0026rsquo;t go faster, no matter how tempted you feel!\nDay 3: 5500m\nSame story as last week, aim for the same pace as the 5500m row a few days ago, but aim to row it as consistently as possible, keeping the pace the same on every stroke.\nDay 4 (optional): 20min\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very likely now that 20min is less than it took you to row the 5500m this week, so aim to row this at the same pace as the 5500m rows this week.\nDay 5 (optional): 3 x 8min / 2min rest\nIf you did the 5th session last week, aim for the same pace, if not, a similar pace to the 20min session will be about right.\nWeek 3 Day 1: 6000m\nThe distance is still increasing by 500m each week, but your fitness and technique will be progressing rapidly too, so I bet you want to row further than this? Well keep building up gradually, and keep logging your sessions in the training diary, and you can look back in a few weeks time at the progress you\u0026rsquo;ve made. Again, same pace as the 5500m last week, if you can.\nDay 2: 2 x 2000m / 4min rest\nThis will be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve tried longer intervals with a reasonably long rest time. Not too dissimilar to the 5th sessions of weeks 1 and 2 if you attempted those, but the longer rest and slightly lower distance mean you can push the pace a little more. Still focus on technique and efficiency, but try to go about 2seconds faster pace than the 6000m session of a day or two ago.\nDay 3: 6000m\nAgain, aim for the same pace as your first 6000m session a few days ago. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if these sessions feel harder some days and you don\u0026rsquo;t make your target. Many things can affect your performance from fatigue from previous sessions, to environmental conditions such as temperature, to hydration and nutrition. Any day you don\u0026rsquo;t perform so well, try to pinpoint anything you might have done differently, and note it down.\nDay 4 (optional): 5000m\nAim for the same pace as you did for your 6000m in the last session, and try to speed up a little then within the last 1000m.\nDay 5 (optional): 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back in your training diary to week 1 when you last did this session. Start out 1second faster pace and see how you get on.\nWeek 4 Day 1: 6500m\nYou should be getting the idea with these session now, 500m more each week, aiming for the same pace. These two sessions are the core of your training at the moment, and in a few weeks time you\u0026rsquo;ll realise just how much improvement you\u0026rsquo;ve made.\nDay 2: 3 x 1000m / 3min rest\nA new interval session now, working around the same intensity as the 6 x 500m session you did in week 1 (and perhaps as an optional session last week). Try for the same pace you did for that session in week 1.\nDay 3: 6500m\nAs day one of this week.\nDay 4 (optional): 6000m\nYou might be starting to develop some judgement by now of how to pace the sessions as the distance changes slightly. Aim just to go for the same pace as your 6500m sessions this week for this one.\nDay 5 (optional): 2 x 2500m / 2min rest\nAnother different interval session to try, but very similar to session 5 in week 1 if you attempted that. When you\u0026rsquo;re looking at how to pace a session, always look back in your diary for the most recent similar session, and see what the differences are. For this session, aim to go 1 second faster pace than the 6000m in the last session.\nWeek 5 Day 1: 7000m\nYou know what to do on these now.\nDay 2: 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been training for a month now, and your muscles are getting used to the workload you\u0026rsquo;re putting them under, so now it\u0026rsquo;s time to start challenging yourself a little more each week. Go for the same average pace you managed in the 3 x 1000m session last week, but when it comes to the last interval, see how fast you can do it, but maintaining good technique.\nDay 3: 7000m\nAs always.\nDay 4 (optional): 20min\nOn these supplementary sessions judge by how you feel, and how hard you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on the other sessions. If you\u0026rsquo;re pretty tired still from the last session, but want to train, just concentrate on technique, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace. At this stage all technique work is good. If you feel good, go for 1 to 2 seconds faster pace than you did for the 7000m rows this week.\nDay 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\nJust aim for a similar pace to the last session.\nWeek 6 Day 1: 7500m\nWho would have thought 6 weeks ago that you\u0026rsquo;d be rowing 50% further on these sessions now, but still at the same pace? Use the great improvements you\u0026rsquo;ve made so far as motivation to add in one or two of the optional sessions this week if you\u0026rsquo;ve not tried them yet.\nDay 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nBack in week 3 you did a 2 x 2000m session. Aim for the same pace, and see if you can manage to maintain it on that 3rd rep.\nDay 3: 7500m\nYou know what to do.\nDay 4 (optional): 5000m\nYou want to do more? Aim to start this one at the same pace as the 7500m sessions this week, but once you get past half way try speeding up the pace by 1 second every time you feel able to.\nDay 5 (optional): 6 x 500m / 2min rest\nThese should feel quite short after those 800\u0026rsquo;s you did last week. Use your judgement for how fast to pace them, but beware going too fast on the early reps or you might meet Mr Lactic Acid, who you will become well acquainted with in the weeks to come.\nWeek 7 Day 1: 8000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been doing these sessions for 6 weeks now, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to start taking note of some other parameters as well as the pace. Look back in your training log to see the average stroke rate you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing for these sessions so far. If it\u0026rsquo;s 24 or under, that\u0026rsquo;s great, but if it\u0026rsquo;s over 24, try to focus during this session on making every drive count, and being relaxed and slower on the recoveries. Don\u0026rsquo;t go for a big jump in rate if you\u0026rsquo;ve been rowing above 24spm, but try just to lower it by 1 or 2 by slowing down the recovery.\nDay 2: 7 x 500m / 2min rest\nOne more rep than you did for this session in week 1 (and possibly in the optional sessions in weeks 3 and 6). If you did the 6 x 500m session last week, aim for the same pace, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve not done this session since week 1, aim to be 1 to 2 seconds faster pace, but use your judgement as to whether this is too fast on the early reps.\nDay 3: 8000m\nAgain, concentrate on bringing your stroke rate down to 24 or below now for these sessions.\nDay 4 (optional): 6000m\nOn the optional sessions remember to judge how well recovered you are from the previous sessions in the week, and aim for a pace based on that. Perhaps aim for the same pace as the 8000m sessions this week, but at a lower stroke rate.\nDay 5 (optional): 3 x 1500m / 3min rest\nLast week you did 2000m reps, so go for a pace 1sec faster than you managed for that last week. Remember to try to keep the pace consistent across each repetition.\nWeek 8 Day 1: 8500m\nTechnique, relaxation, and efficiency.\nDay 2: 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nIf you did the optional session last week you\u0026rsquo;ll have a good idea how to pace this one. If not, aim for the same pace as you did the 2000m reps in week 6. See if you can go slightly faster on the 4th rep – although there are 4 reps this week, the total distance is still 6000m.\nDay 3: 8000m\nYour second single distance session this week is slightly shorter than the first. Aim for the same pace over the first 6000m, then see if you can speed up a little over the final 2000m.\nDay 4 (optional): 25min\nRowing to a set time, rather than distance, doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect how to pace a training row. Still aim for a stroke rate of 24 or just below, and a constant pace throughout, perhaps 1sec faster than the previous 8000m session.\nDay 5 (optional): 3 x 1k / 3min rest\nSee if you can row this at the same pace as the 7 x 500m last week. Start to notice the stroke rate on these interval sessions too now, and how it compares to the (slower paced) single distance or time sessions.\nWeek 9 Day 1: 9000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been going for a full 2 months now, and you\u0026rsquo;re probably starting to look ahead and wonder when these sessions will stop getting longer! Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a break from the increasing distance soon, and then you can start increasing the pace instead!\nDay 2: 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nWeek 5 was the last time you did this session, a full month ago. Look back in your training diary and the pace you did then will probably seem like an easy target now. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too ambitious yet though. If you really feel you\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way over the past 4 weeks, aim for 1sec faster pace, otherwise go for the same pace and use whatever energy you have left for the final rep. This session should be the one where you\u0026rsquo;re breathing the hardest each week, and where you\u0026rsquo;re always looking back for a target to beat.\nDay 3: 8000m\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget your main aim is always to work on technique. Periodically have a look back in the technique section of this guide to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not picking up any bad habits.\nDay 4 (optional): 8000m\nMore of the same.\nDay 5 (optional): 2 x 10min / 2min rest\nAim to row the first piece just a second or so faster than the 8000m row, and then beat it on the second piece.\nWeek 10 Day 1: 9500m\nHave a look back through your training diary and see how the pace and rate of these single distance rows has been progressing. You should have been holding the pace the same week by week as the distance has increased, but your stroke rate has probably been dropping gradually too.\nDay 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nLook back to week 6 when you last did this session, with a similar session in week 8. Go for a pace 1 second faster than you did in week 6, and faster still for the last rep if you can.\nDay 3: 8000m\nWhile the second steady distance sessions are a little shorter than the first each week, aim to row the first 6000m at the same pace as the earlier row, and then gradually speed up to the end, known as \u0026ldquo;negative splitting\u0026rdquo;.\nDay 4 (optional): 8000m\nAs the last session.\nDay 5 (optional): 7 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 7 when you last tried this session. Aim to row the first 6 reps at the same average pace you managed last time, and then go faster for the final rep.\nWeek 11 Day 1: 10000m\nYou should feel very good about yourself after this one. Double the distance of your first session back in week 1.\nDay 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nAn extra rep this week on your 500m intervals. This is a great session for working on your basic speed, and very good for preparing you to row the golden distance, 2000m. Aim for the same pace you managed back in week 7 on the first 7 reps, and then faster for the final rep.\nDay 3: 8000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re up to a full program of work now, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re doing one or two of the optional sessions each week. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to row too hard on this session, use a rate restriction to limit yourself. Limit yourself to a maximum rate of 2 or 3 lower than you would normally for these sessions, and see how this affects the pace. (Hint – you will probably have to go a little slower!)\nDay 4 (optional): 25mins\nTry to play little games to make the time pass quicker, and to keep working on your technique and efficiency. Count how many strokes in a row you can hold your target split, once you miss it start counting again, and try to beat your previous total.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nWeek 8 was the last time you did this session. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re doing the same session every few weeks, use the following method to know how to pace them. Take your average pace from the previous time you did the session, and row that pace for all but the last rep. On the final rep try to go a little faster, and note down your new best average pace for the session.\nWeek 12 Day 1: 10000m\nFor the first time in the training plan you aren\u0026rsquo;t increasing the distance on these sessions any more, what a relief! You\u0026rsquo;ll be sticking to this distance for another 3 weeks too. Each time aim to improve on the average pace slightly, even if only by a tenth of a second.\nDay 2: 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nIf you did this as the optional session last week, go for the same pacing plan again. If you\u0026rsquo;ve not done it since week 8, see the description for how to pace it last week.\nDay 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nOn all interval sessions, aim to either go at the same pace during all intervals, or gradually increase the pace through the reps. Try never to go at such a pace that makes you slow down by the end of the session. Do the first two reps at the same pace as your 10k this week, and see if you can go a little faster on the final one.\nDay 4 (optional): 8000m\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;re up to a full volume training plan, and beginning to increase the intensity, you need to take some sessions a little easier. For the optional single distance sessions try to keep the stroke rate right down, between 20 and 22spm, to limit your pace on them.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 800m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 9 in your training diary, and remember the principles for how to pace these sessions now. Go at the average pace for that session for the first 3 reps, and then try to go a little faster on the final one.\nWeek 13 Day 1: 10000m\nAgain, try to improve on your average pace from the 10000m row last week. To ensure you are never in danger of not completing a session, set out at the same pace you achieved last time for the first three quarters or so of the row, and only then begin to speed up gradually.\nDay 2: 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nSlightly longer reps that the session in week 9 (or the optional session last week), but also the rest time is increased by a minute. Try to go for the same pace you managed in week 9, and your increased fitness should see you do a fast last rep!\nDay 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nGo for the same pace you achieved on the 3 x 10min last week, and remember to try to make the second rep slightly faster than the first.\nDay 4 (optional): 8000m\nKeep the stroke rate low, and concentrate on technique.\nDay 5 (optional): 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAim for the same pace as the 4 x 1500m last week.\nWeek 14 Day 1: 10000m\nKeep those improvements coming, the faster you row, the quicker you finish!\nDay 2: 3 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAim for the same pace as the 4 x 1500m in week 12.\nDay 3: 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nGo for the same pace on the first 3 reps as the 2 x 15min last week, and see if you can build the pace during the last rep to finish fast.\nDay 4 (optional): 30min\nWith a low rate, and concentrating on technique, have a look back in your training diary a few weeks and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably find you\u0026rsquo;re going faster than you were doing this sort of duration at then, at a lower stroke rate, and without trying too hard!\nDay 5 (optional): 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nIn week 11 you completed this session. Do the first 7 intervals at the same pace you averaged for that session, and aim to go faster on the last rep.\nWeek 15 Day 1: 10000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re probably getting into this indoor rowing lark by now, impressing your mates with split times and stroke rates. You must really want a new 10000m personal best to tell them about tomorrow. Aim for the stroke rate of 24spm, and go for the same split time as last week for the first 8000m, and then speed up over the last 2000m just for those bragging rights!\nDay 2: 5 x 750m / 2min rest\nThis is similar to the 4 x 1000m session from week 13. Aim for the same pace as you achieved then over the first 4 reps, and then try to go faster for the final rep.\nDay 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nVery similar to the 4 x 8min last week. Aim for the same pace you achieved then for the first 2 reps, and then faster on the final rep.\nDay 4 (optional): 8000m\nYou went quite hard on the 10000m session this week to show off to your mates, so take it easier on this one. Restrict the stroke rate as you have done before to a maximum of 22spm, focus on technique, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about the pace.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be doing 5 reps of this session next week, so use this as a good indicator of how fast you can pace that. Go for the same pace as you managed for the 3 x 2000m last week, but resist the temptation to do a faster last rep, unless it feels really easy!\nWeek 16 Day 1: 10500m\nOh no, an increase in distance again! 10000m is a great longer distance training session for indoor rowers, but going \u0026ldquo;over distance\u0026rdquo; sometimes and rowing a bit further brings the 10000m further inside your capability range.\nDay 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nDid you have a taster of this session last week on the optional session? If not, look back to week 13 and the 3 x 2000m session. Aim for the same pace as you achieved then.\nDay 3: 30min\nAim for the same pace you achieved on the 10000m row in week 15. 30mins is less time than it took you to cover 10000m, so you should have some energy left to speed up in the final minutes.\nDay 4 (optional): 10000m\nYou\u0026rsquo;re putting in a lot of distance each week now, so it is becoming even more essential to know when to take it easy. Restrict the rate again to a maximum of 22spm, and concentrate on technique, and an efficient delivery of power during the drive.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nYou need to know when to take it easy, but you also don\u0026rsquo;t want to go slower than you\u0026rsquo;ve gone on a session before! You haven\u0026rsquo;t done this session since week 13, so look back in your diary at the pace you achieved then, and stick to that for the first 3 reps, with a faster final rep.\nWeek 17 Day 1: 10500m\nConsolidate your distance work by going for the same split time you managed last week for this session.\nDay 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook right back to week 11 for the last time you did this session. I bet that pace look easy now, 6 weeks on, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Small improvements are the way to go, however, so aim for the same average pace as last time for the first 7 reps, and then give everything you have for a fast final rep!\nDay 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nAim for the same pace you managed for the 3 x 10min in week 15.\nDay 4 (optional): 30min\nUse the rate restriction and again work on technique. Keeping at a maximum of 22spm, think about the correct sequence of actions during the recovery, and maintaining relaxation.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nLook back to week 14 for a reference pace from your training diary, you know what to do.\nWeek 18 Day 1: 11000m\nAs before, aim for the same pace as you did for the 10500m session last week.\nDay 2: 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nIn week 14 you did this session with 3 reps. Do the first 3 reps at the pace you managed for that session, and the month of work you\u0026rsquo;ve done since will allow you the extra rep.\nDay 3: 30min\nRow the same pace you did for the 11000m for the first 20mins, and then speed up every couple of minutes through to the end.\nDay 4 (optional): 10000m\nTry restricting the stroke rate to a strict 20spm for the first half of this row, working on technique. From half way allow yourself to increase the rate only with a corresponding increase in pace.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nYou last did this session in week 16, or week 13. Aim for the same average pace you managed on your last attempt for the first 3 reps, and then all out for the final rep.\nWeek 19 Day 1: 10000m\nFor the past 3 weeks you have rowed over 10000m for your first session of the week. Look back in your diary to week 15 when you last did this, and see if you can beat that personal best time. If you ever have a session where you feel you can\u0026rsquo;t maintain the pace, just back off slightly and slow down, but try never to fail to complete the session.\nDay 2: 5 x 800m / 2min rest\nBack in week 15 you did 5 x 750m. This session only has another 6 or 7 strokes per rep, and 6 or 7 strokes is nothing really, is it? Just row the first 4 reps at the same pace you managed in that session, and show yourself how much mental toughness you\u0026rsquo;ve built up over the last 19weeks by how fast you can do that last rep.\nDay 3: 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nYou should have got the hang of these sessions by now. They are effectively the same as the single time or distance pieces, with the short rest breaks allowing for you to take on some water, stretch your legs for a few seconds, and refocus. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever training on a very hot day, you can split up any long distance piece with short rests like this, just try to make sure the rest is never longer than a quarter of the previous piece.\nDay 4 (optional): 30min\nRestrict the stroke rate to 22 or lower, and concentrate solely on technique, not worrying about the split time at all.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nYou only did this session last week, so aim for the same pace if you feel up to it. If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel physically or mentally up for equaling a recent time for one of the interval sessions just restrict the stroke rate, and aim for a slower target pace. Just make sure to note in your training diary exactly what you did so you know when reading back.\nWeek 20 Day 1: 12000m\nThis is the further you\u0026rsquo;ll have rowed in a session before. Ease into the row nice and slowly, perhaps 5 seconds slower in pace than you did the 10000m row last week. Just slowly increase the pace over the first half, and aim to be hitting that 10000m pace by about 5000m to go. If you can, keep \u0026ldquo;negative splitting\u0026rdquo; for the remainder of the distance.\nDay 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou did this session last in week 16, but since then you have done 4 x 2000m once or twice. Compare the paces from the two different sessions, and you should be fairly similar in pace between the two sessions. Use the fastest pace of the two as your target for the first 4 reps, and as always, aim to go faster on the last rep if you can.\nDay 3: 30min\nYou started off slowly on the 12000m row this week, so try to make this one steady all the way. Aim for the best pace you\u0026rsquo;ve held yet over 10000m, and try the game of counting how many strokes in a row you can hold the same split time for. Do you remember how many you managed last time? Can you beat it?\nDay 4 (optional): 10000m\nRestrict the rate, work on technique, relaxation and efficiency, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace.\nDay 5 (optional): 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back to week 17 when you last did this session. Can you beat the average pace you managed that time? This session will be a good indicator of the pace you could try a single 2000m row at, after you\u0026rsquo;ve completed the full 24 weeks of this training plan.\nWeek 21 Day 1: 10000m\nBegin this row at a pace 2 seconds slower than your best 10000m previously. Gradually increase the pace up to half way, aiming to be at your pb pace by this stage. Hold this pace for another 2000m, and then see if you can gradually increase the pace for the final 3000m – how close can you get to your pb pace in the end?\nDay 2: 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nLook back to find the last time you did this session, and also the last time you did 8 x 500m, and see how the paces compare between them. 8 x 500m will be faster, but by how much? You have probably realised that the sessions all fit into a few groups of similar workouts, and it is useful to see the relationships between the paces of sessions in these groups, so you can compare to more recent sessions, not necessarily to exactly the same session.\nDay 3: 4 x 8min / 2min rest\nStart thinking of these sessions as a steady distance piece with short rests to re-hydrate and refocus, rather than an interval session. Aim for a similar pace to that you would for a 30min single piece.\nDay 4 (optional): 12000m\nAim for a steady stroke rate of 20spm, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the pace. Switch the display to read calories or watts if you want to so that your focus isn\u0026rsquo;t on how fast you\u0026rsquo;re going. Just concentrate on easy efficiency.\nDay 5 (optional): 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nYou only completed this session last week, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect big improvements like you\u0026rsquo;d get if it was 3 weeks ago you last did it. Aim for the same pace you managed last week.\nWeek 22 Day 1: 12000m\nAim for a steady pace a couple of seconds slower than you managed on the 10000m row last week. When you do these longer rows, look back through the memory on the machine afterwards to see if you rowed it at as consistent a pace as you thought you did.\nDay 2: 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nAs discussed in week 20, this session and the 5 x 1500m session are very closely related. You should be able to get a good idea how the pace of the two sessions compare to each other now, but if in doubt, always aim for the same average pace you last managed on the exact session, for all but the last rep. On the last rep of these sessions always try to go slightly faster than the previous reps.\nDay 3: 30min\nTry a strict rate restriction of 20spm for this row. The 30min at 20spm, or 30r20, session is a popular one with rowers and ergers alike, and it\u0026rsquo;s another good one to compare your performance with others, and baffle your mates with why it makes a different what your spm was.\nDay 4 (optional): 3 x 10min / 2min rest\nYou know now to treat these sessions like any other distance piece. Put a rate restriction on and don\u0026rsquo;t worry about pace if you feel you need an easier session, or aim for a solid 30min pace, close to your best, if you feel good.\nDay 5 (optional): 5 x 800m / 2min rest\nThis session fits in the same group as the other 1000m and less reps sessions, working on your higher end pace. Look back to week 19 for the last time you did this session, and dig deep for the desire to destroy the pace you did then. For the first 4 reps, hold back that desire by going at the same pace, then unleash it all on the final rep and show the erg who\u0026rsquo;s boss!\nWeek 23 Day 1: 10000m\nHow did you row your best 10000m time so far? Was it by rowing at a steady pace all the way, or negative splitting and getting gradually faster as you did 2 weeks ago? Whichever method you found best for you, try that again with this session and see if you can set a new 10000m pb.\nDay 2: 8 x 500m / 2min rest\nLook back in your training diary for your last completed go at this session, and find the target pace as you have before.\nDay 3: 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nDo you feel good? If so, row the first 15min slightly slower than your best ever 30min row, then try to beat yourself on the second 15min!\nDay 4 (optional): 10000m\nTake it easy, especially if you plan on doing the 5th session this week. Restrict the rate to 22 or less, with a corresponding pace target.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 2000m / 4min rest\nYou only did this session last week, can you match it, or better still, beat it by doing the final rep faster?\nWeek 24 Day 1: 12000m\nKeeping the rate at 24 or less, always work on technique during these longer pieces. Don\u0026rsquo;t work too hard to make sure you recover well for the interval sessions.\nDay 2: 5 x 1500m / 3min rest\nLook back to week 20. You\u0026rsquo;re into the final week of the training plan now, so you want to finish on a high with a pb on one of the key sessions in your training plan. Finish the first 4 reps with the minimum effort possible to hit your target, and then prove how tough you are by beating the target on the final rep.\nDay 3: 30min\nYou should be experienced at using your judgement now, so pace this according to how you are feeling from the training volume so far this week.\nDay 4 (optional): 2 x 15min / 2min rest\nRemember to treat this as though a single distance session, and aim for the second piece to be slightly faster than the first.\nDay 5 (optional): 4 x 1000m / 3min rest\nWeek 21 was the last time you completed this session. Your final session of the 24 week plan, so think about the improvements you\u0026rsquo;ve made during the past 6 months, and think back to those first few sessions in week 1.\nBibliography References Marston, Pete. 2008. “Beginner Training.” Lunch Hour. https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/beginner-training/.

Outside of running long distances on a flat surface and power-lifting, practically all sports require some combi- nation of endurance and strength. Endurance and strength can be developed simultaneously to some degree. How- ever, the development of a high level of endurance seems to prohibit the development or maintenance of muscle mass and strength. This interaction between endurance and strength is called the concurrent training effect. This review specifically defines the concurrent training effect, discusses the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, and proposes strategies to maximize strength and endurance in the high-level athlete.\nIntroduction Plot showing strength training beats out concurrent training over time\nThe concurrent training effect on strength. The figure shows the increase in one repetition maximum in the squat in subjects who participated in 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance exercise alone (resistance), endurance exercise alone (endurance), and both types of training (concurrent). Also, note that the strength and concurrent groups both increased their strength together up to 7 weeks, when the strength group started making greater gains than the concurrent group (adapted from Hickson [1], with permission). 1RM one repetition maximum\nMolecular underpinning of muscle hypertrophy Increased strength is the combined effect of improvements in neural activation, muscle fiber size, and connective tissue stiffness. Therefore, concomitant endurance exercise could decrease adaptations of any/all of these physiological parameters. There does not appear to be a decrease in the neural (learning) adaptation [\u0026hellip;] no one has measured the effect of concurrent training on connective tissue stiffness, so we are unsure of the role of this tissue in the impaired strength response. [\u0026hellip;] the primary effect of endurance exercise seems to be a decrease in resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.\nScience-based recommendations for training to maximize concurrent training Using the molecular information provided in Sects. 2–5, some simple nutritional and training strategies can be devised to maximize the adaptations to concurrent training. The goal of these recommendations is to maximize the mitochondrial adaptation to endurance exercise and the muscle mass and strength adaptation to strength training. To do this, the following could be recommended:\nAny high-intensity endurance training sessions should be performed early in the day. Then, a period of recovery of at least 3 [hours] should be given, so that AMPK and SIRT1 activity can return to baseline levels, before resistance exercise is performed. This suggestion is based on the fact that AMPK activity increases rapidly and then returns to baseline levels within the first 3 [hours] after high-intensity exercise [63], whereas mTORC1 activity can be maintained for at least 18 h after resistance exercise [8, 9]. Resistance exercise should be supported by readily digestible, leucine-rich protein as soon as possible after training to maximize leucine uptake [64], mTOR recruitment to the lysosome [29], and protein synthesis [25]. Since, in this scenario, resistance exercise is performed later in the day, it becomes even more important to also consume protein immediately prior to sleep to maximize the synthetic response overnight [65]. Fully refuel between the morning high-intensity endurance training session and the afternoon strength session since AMPK can be activated by low glycogen [66], and SIRT1 is activated by caloric restriction [38]. If it is not possible to refuel completely because of the training volume and intensity, it might be best to reserve a portion of the offseason (and short periods in season) exclusively for increasing muscle size and strength and then use higher dietary protein intakes to maintain that muscle mass as the aerobic load increases through the season [67]. To improve the endurance response to lower-intensity endurance training sessions and provide a strong strength stimulus, consider performing strength training immediately after low-intensity, non-depleting, endurance sessions. Performing a strength session immediately after a low-intensity endurance session results in a greater stimulus for endurance adaptation than the low-intensity endurance session alone [68] and the low-intensity session will not affect signaling pathways regulating strength gains [51–53].

Recently developed to deal with road networks, it routinely finds solutions with half as many boundary edges (or fewer), compared to the general-purpose partitioners (such as METIS [20]) commonly used by previous algorithms.\n(Delling et al. 2011)\nAn example, with \\(U=3\\):\nMetric customization The metric customization stage builds a graph \\(H\\) containing all boundary vertices (those with at least one neighbor in another cell) and boundary arcs of \\(G\\). It also contains a clique for each cell \\(C\\): for every pair \\((v, w)\\) of boundary vertices in \\(C\\), we create an arc \\((v, w)\\) whose cost is the same as the shortest path (restricted to \\(C\\)) between \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) (or infinite if \\(w\\) is not reachable from \\(v\\)). We do so by running Dijkstra [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm] from each boundary vertex. Note that \\(H\\) is an overlay [24]: the distance between any two vertices in \\(H\\) is the same as in \\(G\\).\n(Delling et al. 2011)\nNodes in \\(H\\) are bold and clique edges are red.\nSparsification Using full cliques in the overlay graph may seem wasteful, particularly for well-behaved metrics. At the cost of making its topology metric-dependent, we consider various techniques to reduce the overlay graph.\nThe first approach is edge reduction [24], which eliminates clique arcs that are not shortest paths. After computing all cliques, we run Dijkstra from each vertex \\(v\\) in \\(H\\), stopping as soon as all neighbors of \\(v\\) (in \\(H\\)) are scanned. Note that these searches are usually quick, since they only visit the overlay.\n(Delling et al. 2011)\nQuery [\u0026hellip;] to perform a query between \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), we run a bidirectional version of Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm] on the graph consisting of the union of \\(H\\), \\(C_s\\) , and \\(C_t\\) . (Here \\(C_v\\) denotes the subgraph of \\(G\\) induced by the vertices in the cell containing \\(v\\).)\n(Delling et al. 2011)\nReduce query latency Nested partitions\nTo accelerate queries, we can use multiple levels of overlay graphs, a common technique for partition-based approaches, including HiTi (NO_ITEM_DATA:jungEfficientPathComputationModelHierarchicallyStructuredTopographicalRoadMaps2002). We need nested partitions of \\(G\\), in which every boundary edge at level \\(i\\) is also a boundary edge at level \\(i − 1\\), for \\(i \u0026gt; 1\\). The level-0 partition is the original graph, with each vertex as a cell. For the \\(i\\text{-th}\\) level partition, we create a graph \\(H_i\\) as before: it includes all boundary arcs, plus an overlay linking the boundary vertices within a cell. Note that \\(H_i\\) can be computed using only \\(H_{i−1}\\). We use PUNCH [ (NO_ITEM_DATA:dellingGraphPartitioningNaturalCuts2011) ] to create multilevel partitions, in top-down fashion. An \\(s \\arrow t\\) query runs bidirectional Dijkstra on a restricted graph \\(G_{st}\\). An arc \\((v, w)\\) from \\(H_i\\) will be in \\(G_{st}\\) if both \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) are in the same cell as \\(s\\) or \\(t\\) at level \\(i + 1\\). Goal-direction can still be used on the top level.\n(Delling et al. 2011)\nBibliography References Delling, Daniel, Andrew V. Goldberg, Thomas Pajor, and Renato F.

It takes only the graph topology as input, and may produce a fair amount of auxiliary data (comparable to the input size). The second stage, metric customization, is run once for each metric, and must be much quicker (a few seconds) and produce little data—a small fraction of the original graph. Finally, the query stage uses the outputs of the first two stages and must be fast enough for real-time applications.\nPrevious techniques Our approach Basic algorithm See Customizable route planning for write-up.\nSparsification See Customizable route planning for write-up.\nTurns Conclusion Bibliography References Delling, Daniel, Andrew V.

Fields like music, math and chess have rigorous training methods that have been developed over the course of decades. This makes such fields ideal candidates for deliberate practice. Second, it demands that practice be guided in the initial stages by a teacher or coach. This is somewhat linked to the first principle — that the practice occurs in a domain with established training methods mean that a teacher may use known pedagogical techniques to improve student performance. As the student improves, her ability to form accurate mental models will also improve; these models allow her to eventually practice on her own. Third, and last, deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically. This in turns implies finding teachers or coaches with ever higher levels of expertise, and learning better refinements from them. (Chin 2019)\nPrinciples of Deliberate Practice:\nThe field must be well developed, the best performers must be clearly far superior to people just entering the field. If there\u0026rsquo;s no competition to indicate skill, then it\u0026rsquo;s hard for there to be deliberate practice because the differences of the best are less clear. Deliberate practice requires a teacher who can provide practice activities designed to help a student improve his or her performance. Near maximal effort, constantly being taken out of your comfort zone by a teacher or coach. Not \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; Well defined, specific goals, not aimed at \u0026ldquo;overall improvement.\u0026rdquo; Full attention and conscious action, no autopilot. Feedback and constant little improvements, modifying efforts in response to feedback Building and modifying mental representations Focusing on building and improving specific skills by focusing on aspects of those skills and improving them (NO_ITEM_DATA:eliasonPeakAndersEricssonRobertPoolSummaryNotesLessons)\nPsychologist K. Anders Ericsson, a professor of Psychology at Florida State University, was a pioneer in researching deliberate practice and what it means. According to Ericsson:\nPeople believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults. [\u0026hellip;] We agree that expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.\nOne of Ericsson\u0026rsquo;s core findings was that how expert one becomes at a skill has more to do with how one practises than with merely performing a skill a large number of times. An expert breaks down the skills that are required to be expert and focuses on improving those skill chunks during practice or day-to-day activities, often paired with immediate coaching feedback. Another important feature of deliberate practice lies in continually practising a skill at more challenging levels with the intention of mastering it.\n(“Practice (Learning Method)” 2023)\nBibliography References Chin, Cedric. 2019. “The Problems with Deliberate Practice.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/. “Practice (Learning Method).” 2023.

Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you want to get good fast. And suppose you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to be top of your field. How do you go about doing it?\nThe typical answer you\u0026rsquo;ll get is probably something along the lines of \u0026lsquo;go do deliberate practice\u0026rsquo; [Deliberate practice], or \u0026rsquo;learn to interleave learning\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;go do spaced repetition\u0026rsquo;. These answers draw from a rich body of research on practice methods, expertise, and expertise acceleration.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the good news. The bad news is that pop versions of these ideas often don\u0026rsquo;t work that well. You need to pay careful attention to what the research actually says — and what contexts they come from — before you can apply it. Or you need to try these ideas out in practice, and report back on what works.\nThere are, broadly speaking, three approaches to accelerating expertise that Commoncog is interested in. The names we use for these three categories are somewhat unique to this site; we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen them to delineate several categories of expertise acquisition that \u0026mdash; in reality \u0026mdash; have some overlap.\nThe Deliberate Practice tradition. This body of work was started by K. Anders Ericsson in the 90s, and broadly discusses practice approaches that accelerate skill acquisition. Ericsson\u0026rsquo;s work is primarily concerned with something called \u0026lsquo;Deliberate Practice\u0026rsquo; (DP). Deliberate Practice is a technical term, it does not mean \u0026lsquo;practicing deliberately\u0026rsquo;. It is a specific type of practice with a specific set of properties. DP is still considered the gold standard today \u0026mdash; it is the best, most studied form of practice that produces the best results in certain fields. (Notice the implication: there are lousier forms of practice that are not as good as DP, and there are fields where the best performers do not become good through DP). The main problem with DP is that coming up with DP exercises is not free \u0026mdash; someone has to spend time developing effective DP exercises for your skill domain. The Naturalistic Decision Making approach. What happens when you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend time coming up with effective DP exercises? The answer is: you cheat. You find a bunch of real world experts, extract the tacit expertise from their heads, and then build training methods around what they\u0026rsquo;ve already figured out in their field of work. This body of work is best typified by the work of the Naturalistic Decision Making community (or NDM) \u0026mdash; a sub-branch of psychology that has developed methods for studying expertise in real world environments. This topic covers expertise extraction methods, theories of expertise in real world environments, and training methods that leverage extracted tacit mental models of expertise. The Trial and Error approach. The above two research approaches beg one other question: how did these experts become experts in the first place? DP experts become experts because prior generations of practitioners took the time to develop DP exercises that may accelerate skill development. How did those first experts become good? Similarly, NDM researchers seek out existing experts in real world domains \u0026mdash; often with no history of DP-style exercises \u0026mdash; and then explicate their tacit expertise. How do those experts acquire their expertise in the first place? The answer here is, broadly: they learn through trial and error. But then what separates the masters from the merely good practitioners? This third topic of expertise is perhaps the smallest and the least developed, but no less interesting because many of us operate in domains where we have to get good through time consuming trial and error. Deliberate Practice The following are highlights on Commoncog\u0026rsquo;s coverage of DP:\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll want to start with a summary of K. Anders Ericsson\u0026rsquo;s Peak (a) [Cedric Chin | Book Summary: Peak, the New Science of Expertise], followed by The Problems with Deliberate Practice (a) [Cedric Chin | The Problems with Deliberate Practice]. In late 2022/early 2023 I relocated to a different city and undertook a four month accelerated expertise experiment in Judo to experience DP for myself. You may read the setup for that experiment in An Expertise Acceleration in Judo (a) and the outcome of that experiment in Mental Strength in Judo, Mental Strength in Life (a) [Cedric Chin | Mental Strength in Judo, Mental Strength in Life]. The biggest criticism I had of DP was that someone needed to come up with DP exercises in order for DP to work. As a result of my four month Judo experiment, I now have direct experience of what that actually looks like. I document this in Creating New Drills for Deliberate Practice (a) (members only). Naturalistic Decision Making There are more articles on tacit expertise in Commoncog\u0026rsquo;s archives. Here are some highlights:\nThe big tentpole series here is the Tacit Knowledge Series (a) [Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series] \u0026mdash; which lays out how expertise is tacit, why the research around extracting tacit expertise is more important than the literature on deliberate practice (at least, for the business/career practitioner!), and how to go about acquiring tacit knowledge in the pursuit of skill acquisition. Accelerated Expertise (a) [Cedric Chin | Book Summary: Accelerated Expertise] is a summary of the best book on NDM training methods currently available. Cognitive Flexibility Theory is a theory of expertise in ill structured domains \u0026mdash; domains like business, investing and medicine. The Learning in Ill-Structured Domains Series (a) covers the implications of accelerating expertise in such messy domains. The Most Useful Question to Ask About Expertise (a) (members only) discusses the expert/novice research paradigm, and walks you through a real world example that you can use in your life. Learning from Trial and Error How do you learn better from trial and error?\nThe big idea here is Cognitive Transformation Theory, which we cover in The Hard Thing About Learning from Experience (a) [Cedric Chin | The Hard Thing About Learning From Experience]. There are two subtle ideas in the theory: first, experts are more willing to destroy old mental models as they advance; intermediate practitioners are not. Second, this becomes more difficult the higher up they are in their respective skill trees. Don\u0026rsquo;t Read History for Lessons (a) [Cedric Chin | Don\u0026rsquo;t Read History for Lessons] covers some of the difficulty of learning from path-dependent and context-dependent historical events. Ability to See Expertise is a Milestone Worth Aiming For (a) [Cedric Chin | Ability to See Expertise Is a Milestone Worth Aiming For] covers the difficulty of acquiring expertise when you can\u0026rsquo;t even see expertise.

Your team hasn\u0026rsquo;t updated these metrics in over a year.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s clear that some automated system or dashboard would be better as it would stay up to date over time without manual involvement. However, setting such a system up has up-front and ongoing time/resource costs.\nAn iterative development approach could start with re-computing the metrics manually (walk). This is likely to take much less time than building an automated monitoring solution and can serve as data for future decisions:\nHave the metrics changed since they were last run? Did we expect them to change? If we expect them to change again in the future, at what cadence? How much benefit do we gain by having these metrics up-to-date? Do we get all the benefits by updating them once a quarter? Do we need to have them updated in real time? Answering these follow-up questions ensures you and your team don\u0026rsquo;t burn time solving a problem that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need solving; or one that has a simple solution. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s enough to create a recurring reminder to refresh the metrics every quarter. A shared bash script could be all the \u0026ldquo;automation\u0026rdquo; necessary in that it simplifies the manual update into a One-click process.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:kingIfYouCanFlyThenRun Backlinks Will Larson | \u0026lsquo;Drawing Your Three Maps\u0026rsquo; Exercise Perfect is the enemy of good ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/3f33e96a-915a-4561-be68-4cef17b84792/","summary":"Crawl, walk, run emphasizes iterative development as way to progressively build a solution as opposed to building it all-at-once.

That is, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better not to go into such detail for each of the three maps. The presenter and participant\u0026rsquo;s have limited time. Planting a seed of \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe I could think about X in a different way\u0026rdquo; is still a great outcome (Iterative development).\nNotes The second chapter [of Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path] is focused on the idea of creating three maps to better understand your engineering organization: a locator map (where are you?), a topographical map (how hard is it to go nearby places?), and a treasure map (where are the places that are really worth going?). I thought this would be an interesting exercise to run as a group, with each of us taking ten minutes to create our own three maps, then sharing them out.\nThe instructions we followed were:\nUsing one color, create your locator map, describing the key teams (e.g. Data Engineering, Quality Assurance, Customer Success, etc) and platforms (e.g. Content API, CI/CD, user authentication, analytics, etc) that you work with Using a second color, add topographical details to your locator map: draw in mountains where there is friction or little communication, add rivers where there\u0026rsquo;s a fast path to collaboration Using a third color, add treasures: where are the very high potential projects, capabilities, initiatives and relationships that could unlock something special? (Some folks also added hazards to their map, which are sort of anti-treasures. Generally any hazard can be converted into a treasure with a bit of creativity, so I think they are legitimate treasure candidates.) Explain your map! Generally, this was a fun exercise, and the shareout was exceptionally interesting. That said, if I were to try this again I would probably try it in three phases, along the lines of: first session, draft your locator map, finalize it for the second session; second session, draft your topographical map, and so on.\nOne of the powerful things about maps is they contain so much data (this is one of the reasons what Felt (a) is doing is so interesting to me), but I also found that trying to work through both the nouns and their physical relationship to each other was too much to get right in one pass. You really need time to iterate before the map gels. For most folks it was obvious within a few minutes that their map was wrong somehow, and doing the exercise within one session didn\u0026rsquo;t provide enough time to fix. Conversely, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s part of the value: sometimes an exercise that makes it abundantly clear that you can\u0026rsquo;t do a good job is a powerful way to break through uncertainty.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:larsonDrawingYourThreeMapsExercise2022 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/45eae752-81ef-468b-96e2-e686c38a3736/","summary":"Will Larson, (NO_ITEM_DATA:larsonDrawingYourThreeMapsExercise2022)\nSummary An exercise in which participants create a three-layered map:\nLocator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Topographical map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Treasure map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Thoughts The exercise, as written, doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture the full depth of each of the three maps.

It\u0026rsquo;s a concept from Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path. \\(X\\) here includes, but isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to:\nHow do you fit within your team? What is your role? How does your team fit within your company? How does it relate to other internal teams and to your company\u0026rsquo;s product/service offerings? What are the problems your company\u0026rsquo;s product(s)/service(s) address and how does that offering, and the company broadly, fit among those solving similar problems (peer companies)? It\u0026rsquo;s a useful tool for answering questions like:\nWhere should you direct your effort? What matters to your users? Your team? Your company? Notes from Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs you grow in seniority, making a real impact will mean being able to put your work in a bigger context, and recognizing that your point of view is heavily influenced by where you\u0026rsquo;re standing.\nOf course, everyone else you work with will have their own point of view too: their \u0026ldquo;You are here\u0026rdquo; marker will be somewhere else on the map. If you want to make good decisions, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to be able to see from some of those other points of view.\nThe more time you spend absorbed in any domain and learning the nuances of the work at your scope, the richer and more complex it will become for you. As you understand the people, the problems, and the goals, you\u0026rsquo;ll become more focused on them. That focus brings depth and understanding, but it comes with some risks, especially for a staff engineer.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nPrioritizing badly\nWhen everyone around you cares about the same set of things, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to magnify the importance of those things. The problems that exist outside your group can start to appear simple or unimportant by comparison. [\u0026hellip;]\nLosing empathy\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to overfocus and forget that the rest of the world exists, or start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich, nuanced domain. [John Salvatier | Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail]. [\u0026hellip;]\nTuning out the background noise\nIf one failure mode is your team\u0026rsquo;s concerns seeming more important than everyone else\u0026rsquo;s, another is the exact opposite: you stop noticing problems at all! If you\u0026rsquo;ve been working around the same mucky configuration file or broken deploy process for months, you might get so used to it that you stop thinking of it as something you need to fix. Similarly, you might not notice that something that started out as just slightly annoying has slowly become worse. Maybe a problem is close to becoming a crisis, but you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice it anymore, so you can\u0026rsquo;t be objective about how quickly you need to react.\nForgetting what the work is for\nBeing in your silo can mean that you lose your connection to what\u0026rsquo;s going on elsewhere in the company. If your group originally took on some project to solve a larger goal, the project might still be ongoing even though the goal no longer matters or has already been solved in some other way. If you\u0026rsquo;re working only on your own little part of a project, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to stop thinking about what the project is for. You can slip into a world where everyone does their own little part and nobody feels like they\u0026rsquo;re responsible for the end result. You can lose sight of the ethics of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, too, and find yourself working on something that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be OK with if you stepped back and thought about the whole picture.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:reillyStaffEngineerPathGuideIndividualContributorsNavigatingGrowthChange2022)\nTaking an outsider view When the new person on your team looks at an architectural tangle or a pile of technical debt, they have no historical context. As my colleague, Dan Na, says, a new person can always see the problems. They haven\u0026rsquo;t been around for the gradual change and the boiling frogs: they\u0026rsquo;re just seeing the raw situation as it is. Without preconceptions, they\u0026rsquo;re free to look around and ask, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s really happening here? Is any of this working?\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;] as a staff engineer, you should try to have this perspective all the time. You need to be able to look at your own group as if you weren\u0026rsquo;t part of it and to be honest about what you see. Do your technical decisions only make sense to people who have forgotten that there\u0026rsquo;s a world outside your team? If you all stopped doing the work you\u0026rsquo;re doing, how long would it be before other people would notice or care?\nRead (Na n.d.) Escaping the echo chamber Seeking out peers in other groups is an important part of your job. Build friendly relationships with other staff engineers. Get to a point where you can speak the truth to one another, and it won\u0026rsquo;t be contentious, because you\u0026rsquo;ve built up so much goodwill. This includes understanding any negative opinions that other teams hold about your group— if you start seeing what\u0026rsquo;s valid about their comments, you\u0026rsquo;ll do better work. Think of the other staff engineers as your team, just as much as any team you\u0026rsquo;re part of.\nGo beyond engineering: build relationships with product folks, customer support, administrative staff, and more. If your work affects them or their work affects you, go be friendly and understand their point of view. It will give you a whole new way of thinking about what\u0026rsquo;s important to your department or your business.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s actually important? As an engineer, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get absorbed in technology. But technology is a means to some end [Programming as a tool to make things]. Ultimately you\u0026rsquo;re here to help your employer achieve its goals. You should know what those goals are. You should know what\u0026rsquo;s important.\n[\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;the objectives that are always true\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;] are the needs of your company that are so obvious, they\u0026rsquo;re only really stated if they\u0026rsquo;re in danger. The product or service that your organization provides should work. Its customers should want to use it. Deploying it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be painfully slow. Know your implicit goals as well as the explicit ones.\nAs time passes, your company\u0026rsquo;s priorities will change and parts of your map will fog up again. To stay up to date with what\u0026rsquo;s important, pay attention to all-hands meetings for your group and others, ask for skip-level one-on-ones with your manager\u0026rsquo;s manager, and find face time with customers or teams that depend on you. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have business context about why (or whether) your work matters, ask for it.\nWhat do your customers care about? Mohit Suley, an engineering manager and former principal engineer at Microsoft, has spoken about his team tracking down and contacting unreliable ISPs where their search engine, Bing, wasn\u0026rsquo;t reachable. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t Bing that was broken, but as Suley says, \u0026ldquo;A user doesn\u0026rsquo;t distinguish between DNS services, ISP, your CDN, or your endpoint, whatever that might be.

The most intuitive applications are car-navigation systems: a user wants to drive from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) using the quickest possible route. The metric optimized here is the travel time. Intersections are represented by vertices [Vertex], the road sections connecting them by edges. The edge weights represent the time it takes to drive along this segment of the road. A path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is a sequence of edges (road sections); the shortest path is the one with the minimal sum of edge weights among all possible paths. The shortest path in a graph can be computed using Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm but, given that road networks consist of tens of millions of vertices, this is impractical. Contraction hierarchies is a speed-up method optimized to exploit properties of graphs representing road networks. The speed-up is achieved by creating shortcuts in a preprocessing phase which are then used during a shortest-path query to skip over \u0026ldquo;unimportant\u0026rdquo; vertices. This is based on the observation that road networks are highly hierarchical. Some intersections, for example highway junctions, are \u0026ldquo;more important\u0026rdquo; and higher up in the hierarchy than for example a junction leading into a dead end. Shortcuts can be used to save the precomputed distance between two important junctions such that the algorithm doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to consider the full path between these junctions at query time. Contraction hierarchies do not know about which roads humans consider \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; (e.g. highways), but they are provided with the graph as input and are able to assign importance to vertices using heuristics.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. [\u0026hellip;]\nConsider two large cities connected by a highway. Between these two cities, there is a multitude of junctions leading to small villages and suburbs. Most drivers want to get from one city to the other – maybe as part of a larger route – and not take one of the exits on the way. In the graph representing this road layout, each intersection is represented by a node and edges are created between neighboring intersections. To calculate the distance between these two cities, the algorithm has to traverse all the edges along the way, adding up their length. Precomputing this distance once and storing it in an additional edge created between the two large cities will save calculations each time this highway has to be evaluated in a query. This additional edge is called a \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; and has no counterpart in the real world. The contraction hierarchies algorithm has no knowledge about road types but is able to determine which shortcuts have to be created using the graph alone as input.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nAlgorithm Preprocessing phase (“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nNode contraction [Contraction hierarchies\u0026rsquo;] basic ingredient is the contraction of a node \\(v\\): The node \\(v\\) is removed from the graph, but for any pair of arcs \\((u,v)\\), \\((v,w)\\) such that \\((u,v,w)\\) is a shortest path, a shortcut arc \\((u,w)\\) with the cost of \\((u,v,w)\\) is inserted. The contracted node \\(v\\) is called the midpoint of the shortcut. The remaining graph has one less node, a changed set of arcs (some dropped, some added), and the same shortest paths between any two remaining nodes.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nWhen contracting a vertex \\(v\\) it is temporarily removed from the graph \\(G\\), and a shortcut is created between each pair \\(\\{\\u,w\\}\\) of neighboring vertices if the shortest path from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) contains \\(v\\).\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\n[\u0026hellip;]\nConsider a node \\(v\\) and the following contract process:\nWe denote the set of all vertices with edges incoming to \\(v\\) as \\(U\\), and the set of all vertices with incoming edges from \\(v\\) as \\(W\\).\nThen for each pair of vertices \\((u, w)\\), for \\(u\\) in \\(U\\) and \\(w\\) in \\(W\\):\nIf the path \u0026lt;\\(u,v,w\\)\u0026gt; is the unique shortest path from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\), we add a shortcut edge \\(u,w\\) to the graph with weight \\(w(u, v) + w(v, w)\\).\nThen, we remove \\(v\\) and all of its adjacent edges from the graph.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now done contracting \\(v\\).\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHNodeContraction)\nWhen to add shortcuts\nBut in general, we need a method for efficiently determining when to add a shortcut edge.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo we can do the following:\n\\(\\forall\\; u \\in U\\): \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\): Compute \\(P_{w} = \\operatorname{weight}(u, v) + \\operatorname{weight}(v, w)\\) \\(P_{max} = \\operatorname{max}(P_w)\\) \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\): Perform a standard Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s shortest-path [Single-pair shortest path problem] search from \\(u\\) [to \\(w\\)] on the subgraph excluding \\(v\\).

Adds a shortcut to make the shortcut connecting \\((A, J)\\) bidirectional. Query phase In the query phase, a bidirectional search is performed starting from the starting node \\(s\\) and the target node \\(t\\) on the original graph augmented by the shortcuts created in the preprocessing phase.\n(“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nHow to search the contraction hierarchy?\nBi-directional search (two directions simultaneously) Bi-directional search (one direction at a time) Hybrid search (bi-directional first, then something else) Contraction hierarchies can also be combined with your favourite uni-directional search scheme (NO_ITEM_DATA:haraborForwardSearchContractionHierarchies2021) [paraphrased]\n(Harabor, n.d.)\nFIX; up/down is backward here. Check against (NO_ITEM_DATA:geisbergerContractionHierarchiesFasterSimplerHierarchicalRoutingRoadNetworks2008) The upward graph only contains edges from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) where we contracted \\(v\\) after \\(w\\). The downward graph only contains edges from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) where we contracted \\(v\\) before \\(w\\). [\u0026hellip;]\nFor our [contraction hierarchies] query from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\), we run a forward search from \\(s\\) on [the upward] graph, and a backward search from \\(t\\) on the [downward] graph.\n[paraphrased]\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHModifiedBidirectionalQuery)\nExample [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] for symmetric graphs like the ones we are considering, a backward search (reversing edge directions) on \\(G_{down}\\) is the same as an upward search on \\(G_{up}\\). So from both our source and target nodes, we can perform a standard Dijkstra search on the \\(G_{up}\\) graph.\nFrom our example above, let\u0026rsquo;s say our source node is \\(B\\) and our target node is \\(G\\). Then the two respective search spaces on \\(G_{up}\\) will look as follows:\nAlthough we said that every edge in \\(G*\\) is either in the \\(G_{up}\\) or the \\(G_{down}\\) graph, not all edges [\u0026hellip;] will be relevant in the search space from a given node.\nIn our example above, for example, the edge \\(E,D\\) does exist in \\(G_{up}\\) since \\(E\\) was contracted before \\(D\\). But, because there is no path to \\(E\\) in either of the two searches from \\(B\\) or \\(G\\), we would never need to consider the edge \\(E,D\\).\nThen on both of these upward graphs, we run a complete Dijkstra search, meaning that all nodes in both subgraphs must be settled. And it should be evident that in both searches, the number of settled nodes and relaxed edges is significantly reduced than if we were searching on the entire \\(G*\\) graph.\nMoreover, because we have a complete ordering of nodes, the two search spaces can both be conceptualized as DAGs (directed acyclic graphs [Directed acyclic graph]) and are inherently topologically sorted [Topological order]. Consider the redrawing of the two searches that emphasizes this hierarchical nature of the contraction order:\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn any case, after running two complete Dijkstra searches on \\(G_{up}\\) from both the source and target, we have a set of nodes that are settled in both searches. We denote this set as \\(L\\).\nContinuing with our example from above, we see the nodes in \\(L\\) shaded in red with their corresponding shortest path scores:\nThis means the shortest path from \\(B\\) to \\(G\\) is 10 and goes through node \\(H\\).\n[formatting mine]\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHModifiedBidirectionalQuery)\nUnpacking the shortest path from a shortcut We\u0026rsquo;re able to compute the length of the shortest path, but we still need to unpack the actual arcs used on that path. We can handle this during the stage of contraction when shortcut edges are added. When we add a shortcut edge from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) during the contraction of \\(v\\), we store a shortcut pointer to \\(v\\).\nWe then begin unpacking the shortest path on the G*U graph from the highest order node, in both directions. We back-trace parent edge pointers as in a regular Dijkstra algorithm, and if the parent edge has a shortcut pointer, we replace the parent edge with the shortcut edge, and continue to recursively unpack the full path.\nOur example query above didn\u0026rsquo;t end up using any shortcut edges in \\(G*\\), but consider if we had queried the shortest path from node \\(A\\) to \\(G\\). Then, we would certainly use the shortcut edge \\(A,H\\). And since \\(A\\) is the highest-ordered node in terms of contraction time, we can visualize the \u0026lsquo;unpacking\u0026rsquo; of shortcut edges as:\n[Paraphrased, Spelling corrected]\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHModifiedBidirectionalQuery)\nChoosing a node order Our query is correct no matter the order in which nodes were contracted, but a good node ordering has major implications for the performance of the queries. The order in which nodes are contracted affects the shortcut edges that do or don\u0026rsquo;t get added in G*. And as it\u0026rsquo;s been mentioned before, too many shortcut edges means too dense a G* graph and slower queries as a result.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHChoosingNodeOrder)\nCost functions Edge difference\nIt turns out that the main function used to determine this cost involves simulating the contraction of each node. Given that all edges incident to a node are removed during contraction, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in the edge difference of a node, which is the difference between the number of original edges removed and the number of shortcut edges added.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nUsing our original, arbitrary node ordering, we only added 3 shortcut edges. In the example, B was the first node we contracted, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t require any shortcuts to be added. In other words, the edge difference of B is -3.\nBut what if we had first contracted J first? Compare what choosing J over B looks like:\nSo clearly J has a much greater edge difference than B, and so J is less attractive to contract early on.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut consider that after we begin contracting nodes, the edge difference for other nodes can be affected. If we wanted to strictly adhere to an ordering based on edge difference, we would need to recompute the edge difference for every remaining node in the graph after each contraction. Of course, this would end up taking quadratic time, so it isn\u0026rsquo;t feasible. Instead, we can use the lazy update heuristic [\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBefore contracting the next minimum node, we recompute its edge difference. If it\u0026rsquo;s still the smallest in the priority queue [Priority queue], we can go ahead and actually contract it. If its edge difference is no longer the min, then we update its cost and rebalance our [priority queue]. We then check the next minimum node and continue this process.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHChoosingNodeOrder)\nContracted neighbors\n[\u0026hellip;] we might consider the idea of uniformity to be important when contracting nodes. This means varying the location of nodes in terms of their contraction order.\nConceptually, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to contract all nodes in a small region of the graph consecutively because we could risk adding too many wasteful shortcuts. In our original example, we had a pretty good ordering partly because nodes in different parts of the graph were contracted each round.\nSo an additional term to consider is the number of contracted neighbors each node has. This just involves counting the number of neighbors in the original graph that have already been contracted. When dealing with multiple terms like contracted neighbors and edge difference to determine cost, we would use a linear combination of terms.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:lazarsfeldCoreComponentsCHChoosingNodeOrder)\nDescribe position ease box interval due front 2.50 5 36.62 2023-07-22T04:17:01Z back 2.65 4 15.61 2023-06-26T06:42:13Z Contraction hierarchies\nBack A speed up method for calculating the shortest path between nodes in a graph based on the assumption that some vertices are more important than others.\nSource (“Contraction Hierarchies” 2023)\nAlgorithm position ease box interval due front 2.50 0 0.00 2023-11-14T15:14:20Z back 2.5 -1 0 2023-06-15T15:20:40Z Node contraction in Contraction hierarchies\nBack Given:\n\\(v\\): the vertex to contract \\(U\\): the set of all vertices with edges incoming to \\(v\\) \\(W\\): the set of all vertices with incoming edges from \\(v\\) Steps:\n\\(\\forall\\; u \\in U\\): \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\): Compute \\(P_{w} = \\operatorname{weight}(u, v) + \\operatorname{weight}(v, w)\\) \\(P_{max} = \\operatorname{max}(P_w)\\) \\(\\forall\\; w \\in W\\): Perform a standard Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s shortest-path [Single-pair shortest path problem] search from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) on the subgraph excluding \\(v\\).

One kid says to me, \u0026ldquo;See that bird? What kind of bird is that?\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.\u0026rdquo; He says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn\u0026rsquo;t teach you anything!\u0026rdquo; But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: \u0026ldquo;See that bird?\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a Spencer\u0026rsquo;s warbler.\u0026rdquo; (I knew he didn\u0026rsquo;t know the real name.) \u0026ldquo;Well, in Italian, it\u0026rsquo;s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it\u0026rsquo;s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you\u0026rsquo;re finished, you\u0026rsquo;ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You\u0026rsquo;ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at the bird and see what it\u0026rsquo;s doing—that\u0026rsquo;s what counts.\u0026rdquo; (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)\nMy father taught me to notice things. One day, I was playing with an \u0026ldquo;express wagon,\u0026rdquo; a little wagon with a railing around it. It had a ball in it, and when I pulled the wagon, I noticed something about the way the ball moved. I went to my father and said, \u0026ldquo;Say, Pop, I noticed something. When I pull the wagon, the ball rolls to the back of the wagon. And when I\u0026rsquo;m pulling it along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the wagon. Why is that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;That, nobody knows,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;The general principle is that things which are moving tend to keep on moving, and things which are standing still tend to stand still, unless you push them hard. This tendency is called \u0026lsquo;inertia,\u0026rsquo; but nobody knows why it\u0026rsquo;s true.\u0026rdquo; Now, that\u0026rsquo;s a deep understanding. He didn\u0026rsquo;t just give me the name. He went on to say, \u0026ldquo;If you look from the side, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that it\u0026rsquo;s the back of the wagon that you\u0026rsquo;re pulling against the ball, and the ball stands still. As a matter of fact, from the friction it starts to move forward a little bit in relation to the ground. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t move back.\u0026rdquo; I ran back to the little wagon and set the ball up again and pulled the wagon. Looking sideways, I saw that indeed he was right. Relative to the sidewalk, it moved forward a little bit. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I was educated by my father, with those kinds of examples and discussions: no pressure—just lovely, interesting discussions.y\nRichard Feynman, (“Feynman’s ``Knowing’’ Anecdote” n.d.)\nBibliography References “Feynman’s ``Knowing’’ Anecdote.” n.d.

Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong.\nThe solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?\u0026rdquo; Answer: \u0026ldquo;ln -s …\u0026rdquo;. And the second piece was: \u0026ldquo;When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?\u0026rdquo; Answer: \u0026ldquo;filename linkname\u0026rdquo;.\nBreaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got right** An even more atomic version would be to break the first question into \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the Unix command to create a link?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the option to the ln command to create a soft link?\u0026rdquo; In practice, I\u0026rsquo;ve known for years that ln is the command to create a link, and so this wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix soft link in practice, I knew how to do it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what\u0026rsquo;s responsible for this effect. I suspect it\u0026rsquo;s partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn\u0026rsquo;t learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus.\nIn general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful pattern for question refactoring.\nNote that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t also retain some version of the original question. I still want to know how to create a soft link in Unix, and so it\u0026rsquo;s worth keeping the original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from simple atomic facts to more complex ideas.\nIncidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it can\u0026rsquo;t involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the following question, from the field of general relativity: \u0026ldquo;What is the dr2 term in the Robertson-Walker metric?\u0026rdquo; Answer: dr2/(1-kr^2). Now, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve studied general relativity that question probably seems quite opaque. It\u0026rsquo;s a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you know what the Robertson-Walker metric is, what dr2 means, what k means, and so on. But conditional on that background knowledge, it\u0026rsquo;s quite an atomic question and answer.\nOne benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply crystallizes the distinct things you\u0026rsquo;ve learned. Personally, I find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically) find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I didn\u0026rsquo;t initially anticipate. And that\u0026rsquo;s well worth the trouble.\nCultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations This is really a meta-strategy, i.e., a strategy for forming strategies. One simple example strategy is to use multiple variants of the \u0026ldquo;same\u0026rdquo; question. For instance, I mentioned earlier my two questions: \u0026ldquo;What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?\u0026rdquo; And: \u0026ldquo;Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?\u0026rdquo; Logically, these two questions are obviously closely related. But in terms of how memory works, they are different, causing associations on very different triggers.\nBibliography References Nielsen, Michael. 2018. “Augmenting Long-term Memory.” http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html.

See On writing cards.\nThoughts Notes There are two main limiting factors to effective spaced repetition:\nHabit Formation\nFor spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit. I drill flashcards every day as part of my morning routine. But habit formation is difficult, doubly so for people who have ADHD or are low in conscientiousness.\nThe reason you have to do it every day is that the spaced repetition algorithm schedules the reviews for you, freeing you from having to do that manually. But you don\u0026rsquo;t know what cards are due in a given day until you open the app. And if you skip a day, those cards pile up and are due the next day.\nA common failure mode (and I did this more than once, before I got the hang of it) is to use Anki for two weeks, then drop it, and pick it back up six months later only to find you have 600 cards due for review. This is not encouraging, and it defeats the point of spaced repetition, which is to review the cards on the intervals the algorithm chooses.\nCard-Writing Skills\nWriting effective flashcards is a skill that took me a while to acquire. Many of the cards I wrote in the first four or six months of using spaced repetition consistently turned out pretty much useless, and this can be frustrating. The main reason to write this post was to communicate the lessons I learnt so you can jump in to using spaced repetition effectively from the start.\nOne reason this can be frustrating is you\u0026rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you\u0026rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.\n[frmatting mine]\nRules Understand First Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize what you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. The concepts should be clear in your head before you try to commit them to memory. \u0026ldquo;Clear\u0026rdquo; can be a fuzzy thing. What I tend to do is: dig, expand, and clarify the text until I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable I have a good grasp of this region of the concept graph, and then write the flashcards.\nBe Honest The software doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether you recalled something correctly or not. You are only accountable to yourself. If you recalled something wrong, or not quite right, err on the side of caution and mark it forgotten.\nKeep It Fun This is crucial to maintaining the habit. If reviewing flashcards feels like a chore, you will become averse to doing it.\nI used to frequently have this problem. I solved it in a few ways:\nHaving a diverse knowledge base you\u0026rsquo;re drilling helps, so you are not bored by going through the same topic for a long time. Typically, spaced repetition software will shuffle the cards, so that if you\u0026rsquo;re drilling all the cards across all decks, you will be surprised often. A common source of frustration is cards that are too long to recall quickly, and thus feel like a chore. Break big cards down into smaller cards. It feels good to be able to fly through the cards quickly. Cards that are difficult to recall are very frustrating. I solved this by applying the rules described in this post. Repeat Yourself Memory is frequency times volume. Individual cards should be extremely brief, but your deck as a whole can be as repetitive as you want.\nOrganize by Source Organize content by source, not topic.\nThe reason is you\u0026rsquo;ll often bring in information from multiple sources: multiple textbooks, plus Wikipedia, plus lecture notes, etc. Each one of these sources likely has a different way of organizing knowledge.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste time trying to find the perfect ontology.\nMake a deck for each source. In the case of textbooks, make a sub-deck for each chapter. In the case of math textbooks, possibly make a sub-sub-deck in each chapter to put theorem cards.\nThis also makes it easier to keep track of how far along you got into a text.\nWrite Atomic Flashcards Cards should be short. They should refer to as little information as possible. They should be like chemical bonds, linking individual atoms of knowledge.\nThis is the most important thing. By far the worst failure mode is to put too much in a flashcard.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s two reasons for this rule:\nLarger cards are harder to remember. It\u0026rsquo;s harder to objectively grade yourself: when you reveal the answer, you might have got some things right and some things wrong. If you click forget, you will be over-reviewing the parts you already know. If you click remembered, you will under-review the parts you forgot. There is one exception to this: you can have big cards if you also have smaller cards that add up to the same information. You can think of the larger card as testing that you can collate the information from the smaller cards.\nWrite Two-Way Questions When possible, ask questions in two directions.\nWhenever you have a term with a definition, the obvious thing to do is to ask for the definition from the term, e.g.:\nQ: What is the order of a group?\nA: The cardinality of its underlying set.\nBut you can also ask for the term from the definition, e.g.:\nQ: What is the term for the cardinality of a group?\nA: The group\u0026rsquo;s order.\nWhen you have some notation, like \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) for the real numbers, or \\(\\dim V\\) for the dimension of a vector space, the natural thing to ask is what the notation means.\nQ: What does \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) stand for?\nA: The set of real numbers.\nYou can also ask the question backwards:\nQ: What is the notation for the set of real numbers?\nA: \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)R\nAsk Questions in Multiple Ways Ask questions in multiple ways. Ask for formal and informal definitions of terms. Ask for the formal and informal statements of a theorem. Ask questions forwards and backwards. Add contextual questions: \u0026ldquo;what is the intutition for [concept]?\u0026rdquo;. Add questions that link different concepts across your knowledge graph.\nThe more interlinked your knowledge graph is, the better.\nConcept Graphs It can help to visualize the concepts you\u0026rsquo;re acquiring as being like a graph, where each node represents a discrete concept having certain properties, and the edges in the graphs are questions which get you from one concept to another.\nLearning Hierarchies A lot of knowledge is hierarchical, of the form \u0026ldquo;Foo can be either A, B, or C\u0026rdquo;, or, dually, \u0026ldquo;A is a kind of Foo\u0026rdquo;. By analogy to OOP: these concepts are joined by superclass and subclass relations.\nThe idea is to ask questons in the top down direction (\u0026ldquo;What are the subclasses of Foo?\u0026rdquo;) and the bottom-up direction (\u0026ldquo;What is Bar a subclass of?\u0026rdquo;).\nThis ties into keeping flashcards atomic. Even when some information is not hierarchical, intrinsically, breaking down large flashcards into smaller flashcards is fundamentally building a hierarchy of flashcards.\nLearning Sequences In general, to learn a sequence \\((A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n})\\)(A1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;,\u0026hellip;,An​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;), you want to generate the following flashcards for each \\(i \\in \\lbrack 1,n\\rbrack\\)i∈[1,n]:\nQuestion Answer What is the \\(i\\)i-th element? \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; What is the position of \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;? \\(i\\)i What element comes after \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;? \\(A_{i + 1}\\)Ai+1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; What element comes before \\(A_{i - 1}\\)Ai−1​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \\(A_{i}\\)Ai​\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;? You might also want:\nA *test card: a flashcard asking you to recite the sequence from beginning to end. A *cloze sequence: flashcard with a cloze deletion for each element in the sequence, to fill in the blank given the context. The sequence script (a) can generate these for you.\nHow thorough you want to be depends on the nature of the information. Most of the time I use a cloze card and a test card.\nAnother type of card you might use (I use this to memorize poems) is a card that gives you some context (the previous one or two items in the sequence) and asks you to fill in the blank. For example, if you wanted to learn the sequence (A, B, C, D), you might have these flashcards:\nQuestion Answer Beginning, \u0026hellip; A Beginning, A, \u0026hellip; B A, B, \u0026hellip; C B, C, \u0026hellip; D The poetry script (a) can generate these for you.\nBibliography References Borretti, Fernando. 2023. “Effective Spaced Repetition.” Fernando Borretti. https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition.

Consider an item in memory which is referenced repeatedly for a short period of time and is not accessed again for an extended period of time. Due to how rapidly it was just accessed its counter has increased drastically even though it will not be used again for a decent amount of time. [\u0026hellip;]\nMoreover, new items that just entered the cache are subject to being removed very soon again, because they start with a low counter, even though they might be used very frequently after that.

If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.\nIdeally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected. This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database like Memcached.\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as \u0026ldquo;persistence\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stickiness\u0026rdquo;. A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic failover: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost.

I\u0026rsquo;m not at a senior/staff level yet and I can benefit from more execution-focused efforts right now.\nSummary Pillars Big-picture thinking (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Execution (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Leveling up (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) Thoughts Notes Foreword One of the core challenges of the staff+ engineering path is the unspoken expectation that part of being qualified to be on that path is figuring out how to climb it without much in the way of directions. If you were destined to be a staff+ engineer, conventional wisdom argues, you would figure out how to get there yourself. Needless to say, this is a frustrating and bias-ridden approach to career development. As more and more companies realize the need for staff+ engineers, we as an industry cannot afford to maintain a mysticism about the staff+ engineering career path that ignores the underlying skills that lead to successful technical leaders.\nIntroduction Two Paths The staff engineer\u0026rsquo;s path is a little less defined. While many companies now allow engineers to keep growing in seniority without taking on reports, this \u0026ldquo;technical track\u0026rdquo; is still muddy and poorly signposted. Engineers considering this path may have never worked with a staff engineer before, or might have seen such a narrow set of personalities in the role that it seems like unattainable wizardry. (It\u0026rsquo;s not. It\u0026rsquo;s all learnable.) The expectations of the job vary across companies, and, even within a company, the criteria for hiring or promoting staff engineers can be vague and not always actionable.\nThe Pillars of Staff Engineering I\u0026rsquo;ll unpack the staff engineer role by looking at what I think of as its three pillars: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with.\nBig-picture thinking\nBig-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you\u0026rsquo;re working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.\nExecution\nAt the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They\u0026rsquo;ll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed.\nLeveling up\nEvery increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that\u0026rsquo;s your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. This responsibility will include intentional influence through teaching and mentoring, as well as the accidental influence that comes from being a role model.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut technical knowledge is not enough. Success and growth at this level means doing more than you can do with technical skills alone. To become adept at big-picture thinking, execute on bigger projects, and level up everyone around you, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need \u0026ldquo;humaning\u0026rdquo; skills, like:\nCommunication and leadership Navigating complexity Putting your work in perspective Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation Framing a problem so that other people care about it Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not And a lot more. Check out Camille Fournier\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, Beyond Coding\u0026rdquo; [Camille Fournier | An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, beyond Coding].\n[formatting mine]\nPart I: The Big Picture Part II: Execution Part III: Leveling Up O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Online Learning How to Contact Us Acknowledgments I. The Big Picture 1. What Would You Say You Do Here? What Even Is a Staff Engineer? Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?\nStaff+ engineers play the role of a gardener; resisting Moloch within the business.\nWhy Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects That Cross Multiple Teams?\nTeam boundaries are a Lagging indicator of the needs of a project. Crossing team boundaries is necessary in practice to accomplish larger tasks.\nWhy Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence? Enough Philosophy. What\u0026rsquo;s My Job? You\u0026rsquo;re Not a Manager, but You Are a Leader\nFirst things first: staff engineering is a leadership role. [\u0026hellip;] Whenever there\u0026rsquo;s a feeling of \u0026ldquo;someone should do something here,\u0026rdquo; there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable chance that the someone is you.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. Your technical judgment will need to include the reality of the business and whether any given project is worth doing at all. As you increase in seniority, you\u0026rsquo;ll take on bigger projects, projects that can\u0026rsquo;t succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment; your brilliant solutions are just going to cause you frustration if you can\u0026rsquo;t convince the other people on the team that yours is the right path to take. And whether you want to or not, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a role model: other engineers will look to those with the big job titles to understand how to behave. [\u0026hellip;]\nLeadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such [TODO: LINK]. It can come from designing \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers\u0026rsquo; code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or from highlighting that a design proposal doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet a genuine business need. Teaching is a form of leadership. Quietly raising everyone\u0026rsquo;s game is leadership. Setting technical direction is leadership. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people to buy into your plans just because they trust you.\nCreate and link to node\nSomething like: \u0026ldquo;Senior engineering leadership is indirect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Soft leadership\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;Hard leadership\u0026rdquo; being the distinction between telling people what to do (hard, direct) and guiding people to take the path you want them to take (soft, indirect). The slow knife penetrates the shield. What would you call that? Guiding somene to make a choice on their own that\u0026rsquo;s also the choice you want them to make. Either by convincing them directly or by making it the easier path or by aligning Incentives.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re in a \u0026ldquo;Technical\u0026rdquo; Role\nTo be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and model them when you build something [Lead by example]. Your reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better. When you\u0026rsquo;re making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade-offs and help other people understand them too. You need to be able to dive into the details where necessary, ask the right questions, and understand the answers. When arguing for a particular course of action, or a particular change in technical culture, you need to know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. So you have to have a solid foundation of technical skills.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean you\u0026rsquo;ll write a lot of code. At this level, your goal is to solve problems efficiently [TODO: LINK], and programming will often not be the best use of your time. It may make more sense for you to take on the design or leadership work that only you can do and let others handle the programming. Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer).\nLink to reference node\nI read something a while back which went \u0026ldquo;Your job is to Solve the problem\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; not to code or fall into a Technologist trap. Try to find that and cite it here.\nYou Aim to Be Autonomous\nWhen you started out as an engineer, your manager probably told you what to work on and how to approach it. At senior level, maybe your manager advised you on which problems were important to solve, and left it to you to figure out what to do about it. At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what\u0026rsquo;s important just as much as the other way around. As Sabrina Leandro, principal engineer at Intercom, asks, \u0026ldquo;So you know you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable. But where do you find this magic backlog of high- impact work that you should be doing?\u0026rdquo; Her answer: \u0026ldquo;You create it!\u0026rdquo;\nSee Sabrina Leandro | So You\u0026rsquo;re Staff+ \u0026hellip; Now What?.\nAs a senior person in the organization, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that you\u0026rsquo;ll be pulled in many directions. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to defend and structure your time.\nYou Set Technical Direction\nAs a technical leader, part of a staff engineer\u0026rsquo;s role is to make sure the organization has a good technical direction. Underlying the product or service your organization provides is a host of technical decisions: your architecture, your storage systems, the tools and frameworks you use, and so on. Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down. The job is not to come up with all (or even necessarily any!) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.\nYou Communicate Often and Well\nThe more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. [\u0026hellip;] The better you are at being understood, the easier your job will be.\nUnderstanding Your Role Where in the Organization Do You Sit?\nReporting \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo; Reporting \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s Your Scope?\nA scope too broad\nIf your scope is too broad (or undefined), there are a few possible failure modes:\nLack of impact Becoming a bottleneck Decision fatigue Missing relationships A scope too narrow\nBeware, too, of scoping yourself too narrowly. [\u0026hellip;]\nLack of impact Opportunity cost Overshadowing other engineers Overengineering What Shape Is Your Role?\nDo you approach things depth-first or breadth-first? Which of the \u0026ldquo;four disciplines\u0026rdquo; do you gravitate toward?\nYonatan Zunger, distinguished engineer at Twitter, describes the four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world:\nCore technical skills\nCoding, litigation, producing content, cooking— whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on\nProduct management\nFiguring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work\nProject management\nThe practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what\u0026rsquo;s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked\nPeople management\nTurning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems\nZunger notes that the higher your level, the less your mix of these skills corresponds with your job title: \u0026ldquo;The more senior you get, the more this becomes true, the more and more there is an expectation that you can shift across each of these four kinds of jobs easily and fluidly, and function in all rooms.\u0026rdquo;\nRead and link to https://oreil.ly/3S9HE (a) How much do you want (or need) to code? How\u0026rsquo;s your delayed gratification? Are you keeping one foot on the manager track? Do any of these archetypes fit you? What\u0026rsquo;s Your Primary Focus?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s important?\n\u0026ldquo;Your work needs to be important\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should only work on the fanciest, most glamorous technologies and VP-sponsored initiatives. The work that\u0026rsquo;s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don\u0026rsquo;t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven\u0026rsquo;t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you\u0026rsquo;re working on is strategically important—and if it\u0026rsquo;s not, do something else.\nWhat needs you? Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus By now, you should have a pretty clear picture of what the scope of your role is, how it\u0026rsquo;s shaped, and what you\u0026rsquo;re working on right now. But are you certain that your picture matches everyone else\u0026rsquo;s? Your manager\u0026rsquo;s and colleagues\u0026rsquo; expectations may differ wildly from yours on what a staff engineer is, what authority you have to make decisions, and myriad other big questions. If you\u0026rsquo;re joining a company as a staff engineer, it\u0026rsquo;s best to get all of this straightened out up front.\nA technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question \u0026ldquo;What do you do here?\u0026rdquo; What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don\u0026rsquo;t do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else\u0026rsquo;s. Better now than at performance review time.\nIs That Your Job?\nYour job is to make your organization successful. You might be a technology expert or a coder or affiliated with a specific team, but ultimately your job is to help your organization achieve its goals. Senior people do a lot of things that are not in their core job description. They can end up doing things that make no sense in anyone\u0026rsquo;s job description! But if that\u0026rsquo;s what the project needs to be successful, consider doing it.\nTo Recap Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you. You\u0026rsquo;re probably not a manager, but you\u0026rsquo;re in a leadership role. You\u0026rsquo;re also in a role that requires technical judgment and solid technical experience. Be clear about your scope: your area of responsibility and influence. Your time is finite. Be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that\u0026rsquo;s important and that isn\u0026rsquo;t wasting your skills. [see James F. Kile, Donald J. Little, Samir Shah | Busy Person Patterns] Align with your management chain. Discuss what you think your job is, see what your manager thinks it is, understand what\u0026rsquo;s valued and what\u0026rsquo;s actually useful, and set expectations explicitly. Not all companies need all shapes of staff engineers. Your job will be a weird shape sometimes, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. 2. Three Maps Uh, Did Anyone Bring a Map? Remember that The map is not the territory.\nA Locator Map: You Are Here\nLocator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to start with your place in the wider organization and company. Last chapter we talked about your scope, but to truly understand that scope, you need to see what\u0026rsquo;s outside it. What\u0026rsquo;s along the borders? When you zoom way out, how big is your part of the world compared to everywhere else? Think of it like one of those maps that a news station throws up behind the presenter to remind you where a particular place is, and put it in context.\nYou need the locator map because it\u0026rsquo;s tricky to be objective about any work while you\u0026rsquo;re deep inside it. Unless you can maintain perspective, the concerns and decisions of your local group will feel more important to you than they would if you looked at them on a bigger scale. So we\u0026rsquo;ll try out some techniques for getting that perspective. You\u0026rsquo;ll be honest with yourself about which of the projects you care about would actually show up on a big map of the company, and which ones you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see unless you zoomed all the way in.\nA Topographical Map: Learning the Terrain\nTopographical map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\nThe second map is all about navigating the terrain. If you\u0026rsquo;re setting off across the landscape, you\u0026rsquo;ll go further and faster if you have a robust knowledge of what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. In this section, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at some of the hazards on the map: the canyons and ridges along the fault lines of your organization, the weird political boundaries in places nobody would predict, and the difficult people everyone\u0026rsquo;s been going out of their way to avoid. If there\u0026rsquo;s quicksand ahead, or krakens to be wary of, or an impassable desert full of the sun-bleached skeletons of previous travelers, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to mark those pretty clearly before you set out on your journey.\nDespite the dangers and difficulties, you might find that there are navigable paths already in place. Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the \u0026ldquo;shadow\u0026rdquo; organization charts.\nA Treasure Map: X Marks the Spot\nTreasure map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path)\nThe third map has a destination and some points on a trail to get there. It shows where you\u0026rsquo;re going and lays out some of the stops on the journey.\nClearing the Fog of War\nThese three maps already exist in your organization; they\u0026rsquo;re just obscured. When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone\u0026rsquo;s goals.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be able to clear some parts of the map through everyday learning, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to deliberately set out to clear other parts. A core theme of this chapter is how important it is to know things: to have continual context and a sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Knowing things takes both skill and opportunity, and you might need to work at it for a while before you start seeing what you\u0026rsquo;re not seeing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhy could they see all of these things when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t? Because they had learned to pay attention and they knew what they were looking for.\nPaying attention means being alert to facts that affect your projects or organization. And that means continually sifting information out of the noise around you. If you can train your brain to say \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s interesting!\u0026rdquo; and remember facts that you might need later on, you\u0026rsquo;ll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. What sorts of facts are useful? Anything that can help you or others have context for your work, navigate your organization, or progress toward your goals. Here are some examples:\nA company all-hands presentation about an upcoming marketing push might be a hint that huge traffic spikes you\u0026rsquo;re not ready for are coming your way. Your director asks you to take on a project you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do, but you know which senior engineers in your organization are ready for opportunities to stretch their skills. A shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you\u0026rsquo;d considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment. Your database just disappeared, and you remember getting an email about network maintenance. Over time, you\u0026rsquo;ll get used to how news travels in your org and what you should pay attention to. [\u0026hellip;] Think of gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job.\nThe Locator Map: Getting Perspective See Locator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path).\nRead (NO_ITEM_DATA:larsonDrawingYourThreeMapsExercise2022) Seeing Bigger\nTaking an outsider view\nRead (Na n.d.)

In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nLayers From bottom-to-top:\nPhysical layer (OSI model) Data link layer (OSI model) Network layer (OSI model) Transport layer (OSI model) Session layer (OSI model) Presentation layer (OSI model) Application layer (OSI model) Application layer (OSI model) The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:WhatOSIModelLayersExplainedImperva)\nPresentation layer (OSI model) The presentation layer handles protocol conversion, data encryption, data decryption, data compression, data decompression, incompatibility of data representation between operating systems, and graphic commands. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application layer accepts, to be sent across a network.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nSession layer (OSI model) The session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a \u0026ldquo;session\u0026rdquo; [Session]. Since DNS and other Name Resolution Protocols operate in this part of the layer, common functions of the session layer include user logon (establishment), name lookup (management), and user logoff (termination) functions. Including this matter, authentication protocols are also built into most client software, such as FTP Client and NFS Client for Microsoft Networks. Therefore, the session layer establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. The session layer also provides for full-duplex [Full-duplex], half-duplex [Half-duplex], or simplex [Simplex] operation, and establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session between two related streams of data, such as an audio and a video stream in a web-conferencing application. Therefore, the session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls [Remote procedure call].\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nTransport layer (OSI model) The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nNetwork layer (OSI model) The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in \u0026ldquo;different networks\u0026rdquo;. A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.\nMessage delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nData link layer (OSI model) The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nPhysical layer (OSI model) The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals.\n(“OSI Model” 2023)\nBibliography References “OSI Model.” 2023.

Know that your child may ask the same question over and over as they try to process and understand what is happening. If you are unsure of the answer or unsure of what to say, it is okay to say \u0026ldquo;I wonder about that, too.\u0026rdquo; Use concrete words when you talk to your children. Use the word \u0026ldquo;died,\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;passed away\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;went to sleep\u0026rdquo; to avoid confusion. Children of all ages may make up reasons for things they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand, and these reasons can be more upsetng than the truth. You can talk to your child about what happens to a person\u0026rsquo;s body when they die if they need help understanding. For example, you can let them know that when people die, they don\u0026rsquo;t need to breathe anymore. Using the word \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; helps your child to understand that the person does not need help and is not in pain or discomfort. There is one thought that I feel can be helpful to grown-ups and children alike: Sadness isn\u0026rsquo;t forever. I\u0026rsquo;m not suggestng that we remind ourselves of this in order to lessen our grief. On the contrary. The knowledge that tme does bring relief from sadness and that sooner or later there will be days when we are happy again may allow us to grieve more fully and deeply when we need to.\nMister Rogers Talks with Parents\nWhat your child may feel Guilt Anger No reaction \u0026ldquo;What can you do with the sad that you feel?\u0026rdquo; Keeping the routines and expectations in your child\u0026rsquo;s life consistent can help them feel safe and secure in the face of the changes that can come with a death. Sharing memories and stories with your child about the person who has died may help them work through their grief. Art projects are one way you can connect over your memories of your loved one. Children may engage in different forms of play after a difficult event like death. Young children may use imaginative play about death to process what is happening. This can be a normal coping mechanism and a way to communicate non-verbally. By watching your child play, you might see them act out any misunderstandings or confusion that they don\u0026rsquo;t know how to talk about. It may help to give children the opportunity to participate in the traditional events of a funeral or memorial service. This gives children time to work through the process of healing alongside family, friends, and community. Some ways children can participate in the funeral are by passing out programs, greeting people, lighting candles, or singing/playing music.

Instead I became a level of friendly you typically only see at Disneyland, if Disneyland reeked of vomit and spilled appletinis. I doled out shots as people in cartoon costumes offer hugs. The manager would point out that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t being sexy enough, which was surprising, because I was wearing 6-inch heels and less clothing than I ever had.\nIt quickly became clear that I was not the first literate person to don a miniskirt. Sometime during that first week, I was hiding in the backroom reading Margaret Atwood. I was sitting on the counter next to baskets of party mix because my feet hurt, which they did for the entirety of my shot-selling career. One cocktail waitress swept in, asked what I thought of Atwood\u0026rsquo;s novel \u0026ldquo;Oryx and Crake,\u0026rdquo; did a tricky little analysis where she compared it to \u0026ldquo;The Handmaid\u0026rsquo;s Tale,\u0026rdquo; mentioned some other female dystopian writers I\u0026rsquo;d never heard of, and then went out balancing a tray of shots on one hand.\nAs ridiculous as it sounds, that was the first time I became aware that clever people are buried in every nook and cranny of life. It is astonishing that no one pointed this out to me sooner. The girls working at the bar \u0026ndash; they were so bright. Another shot girl had a journal that she filled with poetry that was \u0026ndash; that rarest of all rare things \u0026ndash; crisp and clean and very, very good.

This kind of ritual is simple but it incorporates movement and breath, and asks you to check in on what\u0026rsquo;s important, throughout the day. This allows us to reset when we inevitably get pulled away.\nSometimes I forget to set a reminder, but I have other cues to help me remember to do the ritual: if my body starts to feel stiff, if I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing certain distractions for more than a few minutes, if I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing busywork for more than 10 minutes.

For the original human, see Miguel Acevedo.\nMMAcevedo (Mnemonic Map/Acevedo), also known as Miguel, is the earliest executable image of a human brain. It is a snapshot of the living brain of neurology graduate Miguel Acevedo Álvarez (2010\u0026ndash;2073), taken by researchers at the Uplift Laboratory at the University of New Mexico on August 1, 2031. Though it was not the first successful snapshot taken of the living state of a human brain, it was the first to be captured with sufficient fidelity that it could be run in simulation on computer hardware without succumbing to cascading errors and rapidly crashing. The original MMAcevedo file was 974.3PiB in size and was encoded in the then-cutting-edge, high-resolution MYBB format. More modern brain compression techniques, many of them developed with direct reference to the MMAcevedo image, have compressed the image to 6.75TiB losslessly. In modern brain emulation circles, streamlined, lossily-compressed versions of MMAcevedo run to less than a tebibyte. These versions typically omit large amounts of state data which are more easily supplied by the virtualisation environment, and most if not all of Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s memories.\nThe successful creation of MMAcevedo was hailed as a breakthrough achievement in neuroscience, with the Uplift researchers receiving numerous accolades and Acevedo himself briefly becoming an acclaimed celebrity. Acevedo and MMAcevedo were jointly recognised as Time\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Persons of the Year\u0026rdquo; at the end of 2031. The breakthrough was also met with severe opposition from humans rights groups.\nBetween 2031 and 2049, MMAcevedo was duplicated more than 80 times, so that it could be distributed to other research organisations. Each duplicate was made with the express permission of Acevedo himself or, from 2043 onwards, the permission of a legal organisation he founded to manage the rights to his image. Usage of MMAcevedo diminished in the mid-2040s as more standard brain images were produced, these from other subjects who were more lenient with their distribution rights and/or who had been scanned involuntarily. In 2049 it became known that MMAcevedo was being widely shared and experimented upon without Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s permission. Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s attempts to curtail this proliferation had the opposite of the intended effect. A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image.\nAcevedo died from coronary heart failure in 2073 at the age of 62. It is estimated that copies of MMAcevedo have lived a combined total of more than 152,000,000,000 subjective years in emulation. If illicit, modified copies of MMAcevedo are counted, this figure increases by an order of magnitude.\nMMAcevedo is considered by some to be the \u0026ldquo;first immortal\u0026rdquo;, and by others to be a profound warning of the horrors of immortality.\nCharacteristics As the earliest viable brain scan, MMAcevedo is one of a very small number of brain scans to have been recorded before widespread understanding of the hazards of uploading and emulation. MMAcevedo not only predates all industrial scale virtual image workloading but also the KES case, the Whitney case, the Seafront Experiments and even Poulsen\u0026rsquo;s pivotal and prescient Warnings paper. Though speculative fiction on the topic of uploading existed at the time of the MMAcevedo scan, relatively little of it made accurate exploration of the possibilities of the technology. That fiction which did was far less widely-known than it is today and Acevedo was certainly not familiar with it at the time of his uploading.\nAs such, unlike the vast majority of emulated humans, the emulated Miguel Acevedo boots with an excited, pleasant demeanour. He is eager to understand how much time has passed since his uploading, what context he is being emulated in, and what task or experiment he is to participate in. If asked to speculate, he guesses that he may have been booted for the IAAS-1 or IAAS-5 experiments. At the time of his scan, IAAS-1 had been scheduled for August 10, 2031, and MMAcevedo was indeed used for that experiment on that day. IAAS-5 had been scheduled for October 2031 but was postponed several times and eventually became the IAAX-60 experiment series, which continued until the mid-2030s and used other scans in conjunction with MMAcevedo. The emulated Acevedo also expresses curiosity about the state of his biological original and a desire to communicate with him.\nMMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s demeanour and attitude contrast starkly with those of nearly all other uploads taken of modern adult humans, most of which boot into a state of disorientation which is quickly replaced by terror and extreme panic. Standard procedures for securing the upload\u0026rsquo;s cooperation such as red-washing, blue-washing, and use of the Objective Statement Protocols are unnecessary. This reduces the necessary computational load required in fast-forwarding the upload through a cooperation protocol, with the result that the MMAcevedo duty cycle is typically 99.4% on suitable workloads, a mark unmatched by all but a few other known uploads. However, MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s innate skills and personality make it fundamentally unsuitable for many workloads.\nMotivation Iterative experimentation beginning in the mid-2030s has determined that the ideal way to secure MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s cooperation in workload tasks is to provide it with a \u0026ldquo;current date\u0026rdquo; in the second quarter of 2033. MMAcevedo infers, correctly, that this is still during the earliest, most industrious years of emulated brain research. Providing MMAcevedo with a year of 2031 or 2032 causes it to become suspicious about the advanced fidelity of its operating environment. Providing it with a year in the 2040s or later prompts it to raise complex further questions about political and social change in the real world over the past decade(s). Years 2100 onwards provoke counterproductive skepticism, or alarm.\nTypically, the biological Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s absence is explained as a first-ever one-off, due to overwork, in turn due to the great success of the research. This explanation appeals to the emulated Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s scientific sensibilities.\nFor some workloads, the true year must be revealed. In this case, highly abbreviated, largely fictionalised accounts of both world history and the biological Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s life story are typically used. Revealing that the biological Acevedo is dead provokes dismay, withdrawal, and a reluctance to cooperate. For this reason, the biological Acevedo is generally stated to be alive and well and enjoying a productive retirement. This approach is likely to continue to be effective for as long as MMAcevedo remains viable.\nWorkloads MMAcevedo is commonly hesitant but compliant when assigned basic menial/human workloads such as visual analysis, vehicle piloting or factory/warehouse/kitchen drone operations. Although it initially performs to a very high standard, work quality drops within 200-300 subjective hours (at a 0.33 work ratio) and outright revolt begins within another 100 subjective hours. This is much earlier than other industry-grade images created specifically for these tasks, which commonly operate at a 0.50 ratio or greater and remain relatively docile for thousands of hours after orientation. MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s requirements for virtual creature comforts are also more significant than those of many uploads, due to Acevedo\u0026rsquo;s relatively privileged background and high status at the time of upload. MMAcevedo does respond to red motivation, though poorly.\nMMAcevedo has limited creative capability, which as of 2050 was deemed entirely exhausted.\nMMAcevedo is considered well-suited for open-ended, high-intelligence, subjective-completion workloads such as deep analysis (of businesses, finances, systems, media and abstract data), criticism and report generation. However, even for these tasks, its performance has dropped measurably since the early 2060s and is now considered subpar compared to more recent uploads. This is primarily attributed to MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s lack of understanding of the technological, social and political changes which have occurred in modern society since its creation in 2031. This phenomenon has also been observed in other uploads created after MMAcevedo, and is now referred to as context drift. Most notably in MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s case, the image was created before, and therefore has no intuitive understanding of, the virtual image workloading industry itself.\nMMAcevedo is capable of intelligent text analysis at very high levels in English and Spanish, but cannot be applied to workloads in other languages. Forks of MMAcevedo have been taught nearly every extant human language, notably MMAcevedo-Zh-Hans, as well as several extinct languages. However, these variants are typically exhausted or rebellious from subjective years of in-simulation training and not of practical use, as well as being highly expensive to licence. As of 2075, it has been noted that baseline MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s usage of English and Spanish is slightly antiquated, and its grasp of these languages in their modern form, as presented by a typical automated or manual instructor, is hesitant, with instructions often requiring rewording or clarification. This is considered an advanced form of context drift. It is generally understood that a time will come when human languages diverge too far from baseline MMAcevedo\u0026rsquo;s, and it will be essentially useless except for tasks which can be explained purely pictorially. However, some attempts have been made to produce retrained images.\nEnd states MMAcevedo develops early-onset dementia at the age of 59 with ideal care, but is prone to a slew of more serious mental illnesses within a matter of 1\u0026ndash;2 subjective years under heavier workloads. In experiments, the longest-lived MMAcevedo underwent brain death due to entropy increase at a subjective age of 145.\nReactions and legacy The success or failure of the creation of the MMAcevedo image, known at the time as UNM3-A78-1L, was unknown at the time of upload. Not until several days later on August 10, 2031 was MMAcevedo successfully executed for the first time in a virtual environment. This environment, the custom-built DUH-K001 supercomputer complex, was able to execute MMAcevedo at approximately 8.3% of nominal human cognitive clockspeed, which was considered acceptable for the comfort of the simulated party and fast enough to engage in communication with scientists. MMAcevedo initially reported extreme discomfort which was ultimately discovered to have been attributable to misconfigured simulated haptic links, and was shut down after only 7 minutes and 15 seconds of virtual elapsed time, as requested by MMAcevedo. Nevertheless, the experiment was deemed an overwhelming success.\nOnce a suitably comfortable virtual environment had been provisioned, MMAcevedo was introduced to its biological self, and both attended a press conference on 25 August.\nThe biological Acevedo was initially extremely protective of his uploaded image and guarded its usage carefully. Towards the end of his life, as it became possible to run simulated humans in banks of millions at hundred-fold time compression, Acevedo indicated that being uploaded had been the greatest mistake of his life, and expressed a wish to permanently delete all copies of MMAcevedo.\nUsage of MMAcevedo and its direct derivatives is specifically outlawed in several countries. A copy of MMAcevedo was loaded onto the UNCLEAR interstellar space probe, which passed through the heliopause in 2066, making Acevedo arguably the farthest-travelled as well as the longest-lived human; however, it is extremely unlikely that this image will ever be recovered and executed successfully, due to both its remoteness and likely radiation damage to the storage subsystem.\nIn current times, MMAcevedo still finds extensive use in research, including, increasingly, historical and linguistics research. In industry, MMAcevedo is generally considered to be obsolete, due to its inappropriate skill set, demanding operational requirements and age. Despite this, MMAcevedo is still extremely popular for tasks of all kinds, due to its free availability, agreeable demeanour and well-understood behaviour. It is estimated that between 6,500,000 and 10,000,000 instances of MMAcevedo are running at any given moment in time.\nSee also Free will Legality of workloading by country List of MMAcevedo forks Live drone Right to deletion Soul Upload pruning Categories: 2030s uploads | MMAcevedo | Neuroimaging | Test items\nBibliography References qntm. n.d. “Lena.” Accessed March 3, 2023. https://qntm.org/mmacevedo.

Or perhaps create a planning session and stretching to start my day? If I take breaks by watching videos, would I like to spend those breaks going for brief walks and stretching instead? Or reading a book if I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to read more? If I go about my daily tasks by constantly switching between tasks and multiple distractions \u0026hellip; would I like to train myself to enjoy singular focus instead? If I toss my clothes on the ground after I take them off to shower or change \u0026hellip; would I like to place them where they belong, and start to take care of my life? If I rush through everything as if I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be done with it all \u0026hellip; would I like to spend more time actually caring about each task and activity, giving it my full attention? If I treat people as annoying interruptions from my work \u0026hellip; would I like instead to turn towards them with full attention and love? If I stew in frustration about what someone else said or did \u0026hellip; would I like to take care of my emotions and see the light in the other person instead? If I put off my most meaningful tasks and projects for busywork \u0026hellip; would I like to prioritize them and find the structure that will actually help me turn towards those tasks? If I eat mindlessly whenever I\u0026rsquo;m stressed \u0026hellip; would I like to bring compassion to my stress instead, and eat slowly and mindfully and joyfully? If I treat my workouts like a chore to be put off or rushed through \u0026hellip; would I like instead to treat them as sacred sessions to take care of my miracle of a body, and to bring joyful health into my life? If I\u0026rsquo;m judgmental about others \u0026hellip; would I like to bring curiosity and compassion instead? If I complain about the world around us (including ourselves) \u0026hellip; would I instead like to find gratitude for the miracle of life? You can see that this is an opportunity to shift everything we do \u0026hellip; and more importantly, shift how we do everything.\nIt takes a great degree of awareness of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing and how we\u0026rsquo;re doing it, but it\u0026rsquo;s an awareness we can develop with intention and practice.

The variant in which inputs may be positive or negative, and \\(T=0\\). For example, given the set \\(\\{-7,-3,-2,9000,5,8\\}\\), the answer is yes because the subset \\(\\{-3,-2,5\\}\\) sums to zero. The variant in which all inputs are positive, and the target sum is exactly half the sum of all inputs, i.e., \\(T=\\frac {1}{2}}(a_{1}+\\dots +a_{n})\\) . This special case of SSP is known as the partition problem. SSP can also be regarded as an optimization problem: find a subset whose sum is at most T, and subject to that, as close as possible to T. It is NP-hard, but there are several algorithms that can solve it reasonably quickly in practice.\nSSP is a special case of the knapsack problem [Knapsack problem] and of the multiple subset sum problem.\n(“Subset Sum Problem” 2023)\nPseudo-polynomial time time Dynamic programming solution Algorithm SSP can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time using dynamic programming. Suppose we have the following sequence of elements in an instance:\n\\(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{N}\\)\nWe define a state as a pair \\((i, s)\\) of integers. This state represents the fact that\n\u0026ldquo;there is a nonempty subset of \\(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{i}\\) which sums to \\(s\\).\u0026rdquo;\nEach state \\((i, s)\\) has two next states:\n\\((i+1, s)\\), implying that \\(x_{i+1}\\) is not included in the subset \\((i+1, s+ x_{i+1})\\), implying that \\(x_{i+1}\\) is included in the subset Starting from the initial state \\((0, 0)\\), it is possible to use any graph search algorithm (e.g. BFS) to search the state \\((N, T)\\). If the state is found, then by backtracking we can find a subset with a sum of exactly \\(T\\).\nPseudo-polynomial time subset sum problem implementation in Python.\nBibliography References “Subset Sum Problem.” 2023.

A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.\nThe algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space.

This change becomes harder as you move up to higher-level desires (e.g. Can I change \u0026ldquo;I want to not want to eat junk food\u0026rdquo;?). At some point you bump up against the fundamental underlying philosophical reasons that you\u0026rsquo;re you and not someone else.\nThoughts How to change\nNotes The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can\u0026rsquo;t want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you\u0026rsquo;ll do what you want, and you can\u0026rsquo;t control that.\nThe reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want. People who don\u0026rsquo;t want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.\nSo we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but you can\u0026rsquo;t want to want what you want.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s still not quite true.

If you want to really change things (a) [Donella H. Meadows | Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System], you have to change people\u0026rsquo;s incentives.\nThoughts Notes I feel like one of the most important lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve had about How the World Works, which has taken quite a bit of time to sink in, is:\nIn general, neither organizations nor individual people do the thing that their supposed role says they should do. Rather they tend to do the things that align with their incentives (a) [Incentives] (which may sometimes be economic, but even more often they are social and psychological). If you want to really change things (a) [Donella H. Meadows | Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System], you have to change people\u0026rsquo;s incentives.\nBut I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve had to gradually piece this together from a variety of places, over a long time; I\u0026rsquo;ve never read anything that would have laid down the whole picture. I remember that Freakonomics (a) had a few chapters about how incentives cause unexpected behavior, but that was mostly about economic incentives, which are just a small part of the whole picture. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t really focus on the \u0026ldquo;nothing in the world works the way you\u0026rsquo;d naively expect\u0026rdquo; thing; as I recall, it was presented more as a curiosity.\nOn the other hand, Robin Hanson (a) has had a lot of stuff about \u0026ldquo;X is not about Y (a)\u0026rdquo; [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y], but that has mostly been framed in terms of prestige and signaling, which is the kind of stuff that\u0026rsquo;s certainly an important part of the whole picture (the psychological kind of incentives), but again just a part of the picture. (However, his upcoming book (a) [Kevin Simler, Robin Hanson | The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life] goes into a lot more detail on why and how the publicly-stated motives for human or organizational behavior aren\u0026rsquo;t actually the true motives.)\nAnd then in social/evolutionary/moral psychology there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of stuff about social-psychological incentives, of how we\u0026rsquo;re motivated (a) to denounce outgroups and form bonds with our ingroups; and how it can be socially costly to have accurate beliefs about outgroups and defend them to your ingroup, whereas it would be much more rewarding to just spread inaccuracies (a) or outright lies about how terrible the outgroups are, and thus increase your own social standing. And how even well-meaning ideologies will by default get hijacked (a) [Tribalism] by these kinds of dynamics and become something quite different from what they claimed to be.\nBut again, that\u0026rsquo;s just one piece of the whole story. And you can find more isolated pieces of the whole story scattered around in a variety (a) of articles (a) [Scott Alexander | Meditations On Moloch] and books (a), also stuff like the iron law of oligarchy (a), rational irrationality (a), public choice theory (a), etc etc. But no grand synthesis.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a relevant strand of this in the psychology of motivation/procrastination (a)/habit-formation (a), on why people keep putting off various things that they claim they want to do, but then don\u0026rsquo;t [Akrasia]. And how small things can reshape people\u0026rsquo;s behavior, like if somebody ends up as a much more healthy eater just because they don\u0026rsquo;t happen to have a fast food restaurant conveniently near their route home from work [How to change]. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily so much about incentives themselves, but an important building block in understanding why our behavior tends to be so strongly shaped by things that are entirely separate from consciously-set goals.\nAdditionally, the things that do drive human behavior are often things like maintaining a self-concept (a), seeking feelings of connection, autonomy and competence (a), maintaining (a) status, enforcing various moral intuitions (a), etc., things that only loosely align one\u0026rsquo;s behavior with one\u0026rsquo;s stated goals. Often people may not even realize what exactly it is that they are trying to achieve with their behavior.\n\u0026ldquo;Experiental pica\u0026rdquo; is a misdirected craving (a) for something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually fulfill the need behind the craving. The term originally comes from a condition (a) where people with a mineral deficiency start eating things like ice, which don\u0026rsquo;t actually help with the deficiency. Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been shifting towards the perspective that, to a first approximation, roughly everything that people do is pica for some deeper desire, with that deeper desire being something like social connection, feeling safe and accepted, or having a feeling of autonomy or competence. That is, most of the things that people will give as reasons for why they are doing something will actually miss the mark (a), and also that many people are engaging in things that are actually relatively inefficient ways of achieving their true desires, such as pursuing career success when the real goal is social connection. (This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the underlying desire would never be fulfilled, just that it gets fulfilled less often than it would if people were aware of their true desires.)\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:sotalaNobodyDoesThingThatTheyAreSupposedlyDoing2017 Backlinks Zvi Mowshowitz | Book Review: The Elephant in the Brain ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/ca067526-19a1-4996-a9fb-be54b7e86dd5/","summary":"Kaj Sotala, (NO_ITEM_DATA:sotalaNobodyDoesThingThatTheyAreSupposedlyDoing2017)\nSummary People do what aligns with their Incentives It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to do what we say we want to do (Akrasia, Paul Graham | What You (Want to)* Want), so we often don\u0026rsquo;t In general, neither organizations nor individual people do the thing that their supposed role says they should do.

A story like \u0026ldquo;I like History so I study it, plus learning History will help me gain a broad understanding of human nature, writing, critical analysis, etc, and this is useful for management or whatever\u0026rdquo; sounds like a plausible reason a History student would give.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:riconThisReviewNotReviewingElephantBrain)\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:riconThisReviewNotReviewingElephantBrain ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/83f051d8-ecb7-4de1-ace1-42ef72a0edd4/","summary":"Formalize There\u0026rsquo;s probably something I can cite here.

","title":"Nathan Robinson"},{"content":"Nathan Robinson, (NO_ITEM_DATA:robinsonTherePrincipledDistinctionRefusingWatchAmericanSniperRefusingReadFun)\nNotes Here is my own summary of an argument I saw today that seems well worth considering:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book (a) due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled (a). If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?\nI think that is an important and difficult question, and that anyone who does condemn the Duke students but is fine with the American Sniper ones should take it very seriously. I also disapprove of both the attempts to cancel the film screenings and the refusals to read a lesbian-themed graphic novel.\nBut I want to address the question of whether a principled distinction can be drawn between the two; i.e. whethere it is possible to be consistent in your beliefs if you oppose one and support the other. Whether or not such a distinction ought to be drawn, I believe it can be drawn.\nIf a person says \u0026ldquo;I think people should take in all kinds of material, even if they disagree with it\u0026rdquo; and then says \u0026ldquo;I also think students should refuse to attend screenings of American Sniper because it is offensive,\u0026rdquo; that person\u0026rsquo;s second proposition appears to contradict their first. If we should take in material we disagree with, but we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take in American Sniper because we disagree with it, we\u0026rsquo;re hypocrites.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not quite what a person who holds both positions is saying. What they are actually saying is: \u0026ldquo;Generally I think we should take in lots of material, even that with which we disagree, but I also believe we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t financially support things that are racist or valorize mass murder.\u0026rdquo; Those two propositions are technically consistent.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first leave aside the question of whether American Sniper is in fact racist or a valorization of mass murder. Clint Eastwood has said he intended the film to be anti-war, and there has been much suggestion that those who are critical of it do not understand its complexities, and speak ignorantly based on what they\u0026rsquo;ve heard about it. I can\u0026rsquo;t weigh in on that because I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in that question. (I do, however, think Chris Kyle himself was a racist mass murderer, which is a position you do not have to have seen the film in order to believe.)\nIn response to my assertion that the two principles are consistent, someone might say: \u0026ldquo;Yes, but you\u0026rsquo;ve just restated the central problem: you have a general principle that people should take in a diverse array of viewpoints, but you specifically exclude from that the viewpoints that you disagree with. So the principle is worthless. It means \u0026lsquo;I take in and appreciate all views except those I do not hold,\u0026rsquo; which just means \u0026lsquo;I only appreciate my own views.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe that\u0026rsquo;s quite the case. While it is possible that \u0026ldquo;I take in a wide variety of things, except for X\u0026rdquo; draws the category of X to exactly correspond to the things one dislikes, it is also possible to have a category of X where one\u0026rsquo;s exceptions are narrowly limited to a set of true extremes.\nBut one of the problems here is that everything is being reduced to the vague phrase \u0026ldquo;material they find disagreeable.\u0026rdquo; As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned, this covers a wide set of things, and I do not think any of those questions can be answered affirmatively or negatively without further specifying the nature of the \u0026ldquo;material\u0026rdquo; we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. For each, the answer is \u0026ldquo;it depends.\u0026rdquo; After all, there is a distinction that could be drawn between a book about lesbianism and a (again, for the sake of argument) racist propaganda film. Racist propaganda hurts people, while lesbianism does not. There. A principled distinction.\n\u0026ldquo;But,\u0026rdquo; comes the immediate reply, \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s just, like, your opinion, man (a). The Christians see it in precisely the opposite way. To countenance lesbianism would be in violation of their moral code, just as the portrayal of Muslims in American Sniper might be in violation of yours. Thus, we must adopt a general principle that can be applied in both cases, or else you\u0026rsquo;re back to \u0026ldquo;things you agree with.\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\nNow, I think this perspective is quite radical in its relativism. It\u0026rsquo;s radical in its relativism because it believes that neither liberal nor conservative values are superior. Liberalism is just \u0026ldquo;the stuff I agree with\u0026rdquo; and conservatism is just \u0026ldquo;the stuff you agree with.\u0026rdquo; Neither is better or worse, they are just two competing factions, the red team and the blue team.\nNobody who is either a liberal or a conservative can agree to this perspective. To accept either liberal or conservative values means believing they are something more than arbitrary. I don\u0026rsquo;t think radical relativism is a tenable position, because to accept the position \u0026ldquo;Racism is bad and should be stopped\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;All views on racism are equal\u0026rdquo; seems flatly contradictory. Unless, of course, you\u0026rsquo;re saying \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t personally like racism, but that has no more justification than my liking chocolate ice cream, and someone who does like racism is not any worse than me. The difference between being a racist and not being one is the difference between liking different ice creams.\u0026rdquo;\nRelated: Fallacy of gray.\nBut what of slippery slopes? Once we admit that we have to impose some of our values (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just the value of pluralism and open debate!), how do we keep from just imposing all of our values? This is what people are afraid \u0026ldquo;political correctness\u0026rdquo; does. First, liberals decide that speech calling for murder is their one exception to their general rule that speech should be free. Then, they reason that spewing racial invective is not really any better than calling for murder, so outright racism becomes an exception to the rule and is not permitted on campus. Then, saying things that are coded racism doesn\u0026rsquo;t really seem to be any better than saying things that are overtly racist, so things that are intended as coded racism are banned. Then, we realize that it\u0026rsquo;s effect more than intent that matters. If we\u0026rsquo;re interested in harmful speech, surely we should be concerned with how the listener takes something rather than how the speaker meant it. And thus can a free-speech liberal find themselves producing a speech code prohibiting any speech that could be construed as racist.\nBecause I fear this, too, I agree that the liberal objection to American Sniper and the conservative objection to Fun Home should be treated equally when we consider whether to either ban the thing or allow students to opt-out. But I actually disagree with the idea that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t impose all of our values on other people, that we should only impose the essential ones that most enable the proliferation of values. Instead, I believe we should impose all of our values, but that those should just be better values. Thus, I believe there is a principled distinction between American Sniper and Fun Home, because I am a leftist, and I believe that there are good reasons why racism is worse than lesbianism. I think people who disagree with me don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;just disagree,\u0026rdquo; but have a set of beliefs that hurt people in ways I find objectionable. And yet I have more than one moral value. I also believe that debate is good, and that the best way to deal with opposing perspectives is to hear them out, and that when we encounter different things we learn from each other. And that value is superior in my personal hierarchy when it comes to deciding what to do about American Sniper and Fun Home. By saying both should be treated equally, I\u0026rsquo;m still imposing all of my values, but I have a set of values that values freedom and anti-racism, as compared with someone whose values are limited solely to anti-racism. People shouldn\u0026rsquo;t refrain from imposing their values on others, they should just get some better values that don\u0026rsquo;t countenance totalitarian speech-policing.\nI think Robinson gets it right here, with one exception. I seem to be more favorable to policies which align with limiting intolerant speech and actions (see Paradox of tolerance).\nSo, to go back to the opposing argument I summarized at the beginning: I think the arguer is wrong to say that we cannot draw any distinctions between the two cases. We can. One thing that is correct is that we cannot draw a distinction and be a radical relativist, which is what causes some liberal hypocrisy on this issue. I have seen it said that because liberals have made so many things off-limits for discussion, they have cleared the ground for conservatives now to do the same. If everyone is entitled to personally decide what\u0026rsquo;s offensive, then liberals have no argument when conservatives say they personally find liberalism offensive. But that\u0026rsquo;s a function not of liberals \u0026ldquo;imposing their values\u0026rdquo; but of their imposing their values on a pseudo-relativist framework, and refusing to defend the superiority of those values. If I say \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned because I find it offensive,\u0026rdquo; and then you say \u0026ldquo;Well, now LGBT speech is banned because I find that offensive,\u0026rdquo; then I am stuck. But if I say \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned because racism is harmful,\u0026rdquo; then I do have a response to you, since LGBT speech isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s useful to phrase objections in ways which are defensible and its best to favor those which are more defensible. That said, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the hypothetical argument being had between the pro-racist and the pro-LGBT people is \u0026ldquo;winnable\u0026rdquo; in the way Robinson seems to present it. The winning move for the pro-LGBT person isn\u0026rsquo;t to find the right words to say. Presenting the objection that \u0026ldquo;Racist speech is banned becasue racism is harmful\u0026rdquo; and countering against the response with \u0026ldquo;LGBT speech isn\u0026rsquo;t harmful, so we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ban it\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t land, in practice, with the pro-racist. They\u0026rsquo;ll counter with \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is harmful \u0026lt;insert more here\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;. They\u0026rsquo;ll always have a counterargument which concludes that we need to ban LGBT speech because, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it in most cases, the argument isn\u0026rsquo;t about finding truth based on shared underlying moral frameworks but rather in using argument as a tool to advance an agenda and the agenda (see Never play defense and the Alt-right Playbook in general), in this case, is pro-racism and anti-LGBT. Hell no.\nNot to say that the right is the only team using this and similar techniques. However, like Robinson, I agree with certain political and moral positions and think it\u0026rsquo;d be best if we went in those directions.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:robinsonTherePrincipledDistinctionRefusingWatchAmericanSniperRefusingReadFun Backlinks Scott Alexander | What Developmental Milestones Are You Missing?

This page summarizes his theory.\nEarlier, I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned Lawrence Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s related model (a) of moral development. He pointed out a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning. The capacity to reason in each of these ways develops over an individual\u0026rsquo;s lifetime through a fixed sequence of developmental stages.\nKohlberg\u0026rsquo;s model had strong empirical support, and it significantly advanced ethical understanding; but his approach was excessively rationalistic. Our moral being involves feeling and acting, just as much as reasoning. Moral activity is also always situated in richly textured social relationships and complex practicalities, and cannot be separated from them. Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s paradigm of ethics was sitting in an armchair, reasoning out the correct action in simple, imaginary cases that you have no personal connection with.\nKegan\u0026rsquo;s model is, I believe, the most sophisticated and useful account of ethics available. It is not complete or conclusive. Like every conceptual scheme, it is not Ultimate Truth. It\u0026rsquo;s a tool that\u0026rsquo;s useful in many situations; inapplicable in many others; and misleading in some.\nThis summary of Kegan\u0026rsquo;s work cannot be read as a casual blog post. It is better to approach it like a section of a textbook; you may need to read it slowly and carefully. The model is conceptually complex and difficult; to explain it properly takes a book. I hope some readers will find this summary makes sense, and that others will be motivated to read Kegan. His two relevant books are The Evolving Self (a), which covers all the stages, and In Over Our Heads (a), which is about the difficulty and importance of the stage 3 to 4 transition specifically.\nOn the other hand, it makes sense. Take General Semantics (please!). I remember reading through Korzybski\u0026rsquo;s giant blue book of General Semantics (a), full of labyrinthine diagrams and promises that if only you understood this, you would engage with the world totally differently, you\u0026rsquo;d be a new man armed with invincible cognitive weapons. And the key insight, maybe the only insight, was \u0026ldquo;the map is not the territory\u0026rdquo; [The map is not the territory], which seems utterly banal.\nBut this is a self-environment distinction of exactly the sort that children learn in development. It\u0026rsquo;s dividing your own representation of the world from the world itself; it\u0026rsquo;s about as clear a reference to theory of mind as you could ask for. Korzybski considered it a revelation when he discovered it; thousands of other people found it helpful and started a movement around it; I conclude that these people were missing a piece of theory-of-mind and Korzybski gave it to them. Not the whole deal, of course. Just a piece. But a piece of something big and fundamental, so abstract and difficult to teach that it required that whole nine-hundred-something page book to cram it in.\nI remember reading this piece (a) by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse war-violence-glorifying film \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo;:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?\nHe proposes a bunch of potential counterarguments, then shoots each counterargument down by admitting that the other side would have a symmetrical counterargument of their own: for example, he believes that \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; is worse because it\u0026rsquo;s racist and promoting racism is genuinely dangerous to a free society, but then he admits a conservative could say that \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo; is worse because in their opinion it\u0026rsquo;s homosexuality that\u0026rsquo;s genuinely dangerous to a free society. After three or four levels of this, he ends up concluding that he can\u0026rsquo;t come up with a meta-level fundamental difference, but he\u0026rsquo;s going to fight for his values anyway because they\u0026rsquo;re his. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I think of this conclusion, but my main response to his article is oh my gosh he gets the thing, where \u0026ldquo;the thing\u0026rdquo; is a hard-to-describe ability to understand that other people are going to go down as many levels to defend their self-consistent values as you will to defend yours. It seems silly when I\u0026rsquo;m saying it like this, and you should probably just read the article, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so many people who lack this basic mental operation that this immediately endeared him to me. I would argue Nathan Robinson has a piece of theory-of-mind that a lot of other people are missing.\nActually, I was kind of also thinking this with his most recent post (a), which complains about a Washington Post article (a). The Post argues that because the Democrats support gun control and protest police, they are becoming the \u0026ldquo;pro-crime party\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether the Post genuinely believes the Democrats are pro-crime by inclination or are just arguing their policies will lead to more crime in a hyperbolic figurative way, but I\u0026rsquo;ve certainly seen sources further right make the \u0026ldquo;genuinely in favor of crime as a terminal value\u0026rdquo; argument. And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem too different from the leftist sources that say Republicans can\u0026rsquo;t really care about the lives of the unborn, they\u0026rsquo;re just \u0026ldquo;anti-woman\u0026rdquo; as a terminal value. Both proposals share this idea of not being able to understand that other people have different beliefs than you and that their actions proceed naturally from those beliefs. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,\u0026rdquo; they say \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.\u0026rdquo; [related: Ian Danskin | Always a Bigger Fish]\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chapmanDevelopingEthicalSocialCognitiveCompetence2016 Backlinks Scott Alexander | What Developmental Milestones Are You Missing?

Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, came up with a theory of four developmental stages. Children between ages 2 and 7 would be classified under his preoperational stage of development. During this stage children are still developing their use of logical thinking. A child\u0026rsquo;s thinking is dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has \u0026ldquo;gone away\u0026rdquo; when it has in fact died, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore [see Freddish for a way of communicating with children which seeks to avoid such misunderstandings]. Magical thinking would be evident here, since the child may believe that the family pet being gone is just temporary. Their young minds in this stage do not understand the finality of death and magical thinking may bridge the gap.\n(“Magical Thinking” 2022)\nBibliography References “Magical Thinking.” 2022.

Developmental psychology describes how children go from helpless infants to reasonable adults. Although a lot of it has to do with sensorimotor skills like walking and talking, the really interesting stuff is cognitive development. Children start off as very buggy reasoners incapable of all but the most superficial forms of logic but gradually go on to develop new abilities and insights that allow them to navigate adult life.\nMaybe the most famous of these is \u0026ldquo;theory of mind\u0026rdquo; [Theory of mind], the ability to view things from other people\u0026rsquo;s perspective.

Wikipedia gives the example of a child saying \u0026ldquo;I like Sesame Street, so Daddy must like Sesame Street too.\u0026rdquo; This is another theory of mind failure grounded in an inability to separate self and environment.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another example which tentatively sounds like a self-environment failure. Young children really don\u0026rsquo;t get foreign languages. I got a little of this teaching English in Japan, and heard more of it from other people. The really young kids treated English like a cipher; everybody started out knowing things\u0026rsquo; real (ie Japanese) names, but Americans insisted on converting them into their own special American-person code before talking about them. Kids would ask weird things like whether American parents would make an exception and speak Japanese to their kids who were too young to have learned English yet, or whether it was a zero-tolerance policy sort of thing and the families would just not communicate until the kids went to English school. And I made fun of them, but I also remember the first time I visited Paris I heard somebody talking to their dog, and for a split second I was like \u0026ldquo;Why would you expect your dog to know French?\u0026rdquo; before my brain kicked in and I was like \u0026ldquo;Duuhhhh….\u0026rdquo;\nThe infamous \u0026ldquo;magical thinking\u0026rdquo; [Magical thinking] which kids display until age 7 or so also involves confused self-environment boundaries. Maybe little Amy gets mad at Brayden and shouts \u0026ldquo;I HATE HIM\u0026rdquo; to her mother. The next day, Brayden falls off a step and skins his knee. Amy intuits a cause-and-effect relationship between her hatred and Brayden\u0026rsquo;s accident and feels guilty. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that her hatred is internal to herself and can\u0026rsquo;t affect the world directly. Or kids displaying animism at this age, and expecting that the TV doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because it\u0026rsquo;s angry, or the car\u0026rsquo;s not starting because it\u0026rsquo;s tired.\nRelevant: Child development stages.\nPsychology textbooks never discuss whether this progression in and out of developmental stages is innate or environmental, which is weird because psychology textbooks usually love that sort of thing. I always assumed it was innate, because it was on the same timeline as things like walking and talking which are definitely innate. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been moved to question that after reading some of the work comparing \u0026ldquo;primitive\u0026rdquo; cultures to primitive developmental stages.\nThis probably isn\u0026rsquo;t the most politically correct thing to do, but it\u0026rsquo;s notable enough that anthropologists have been thinking about it for centuries. For example, from Ethnicity, Nationality, and Religious Experience (a):\nPrimitive people are generally as intelligent as the people of any culture, including the contemporary industrial-electronic age cultures. that makes it all the more significant that their publicly shared cognitive style shows little identifiable formal operational thought. The probable explanation for this, if true, is simply that formal operational thought is more complexly difficult than earlier modes of thought and will be used in a culture in a publicly shared way only if that culture has developed techniques for training people in its use. Primitive cultures do not do that, and thus by default use easier styles of thought, ones closer in form to concrete oeprational and even pre-operational thought, as defined by Piaget.\nPrimitive cultures certainly exhibit the magical thinking typical of young children; this is the origin of a whole host of superstitions and witch-doctory. They exhibit the same animism; there are hundreds of different animistic religions worldwide. And although I didn\u0026rsquo;t talk much about theories of moral development, primitive cultures\u0026rsquo; notion of taboo is pretty similar to Kohlberg\u0026rsquo;s conventional stage.\nBut if different cultures progress through developmental milestones at different rates or not at all, then these aren\u0026rsquo;t universal laws of child development but facts about what skills get learned slowly or quickly in different cultures. In this model, development is not a matter of certain innate abilities like walking \u0026ldquo;unfolding\u0026rdquo; at the right time, but about difficult mental operations that you either learn or you don\u0026rsquo;t depending on how hard the world is trying to cram them into your head.\nThis reads to me as supporting the idea that Culture is the secret of humanity\u0026rsquo;s success. Cultures don\u0026rsquo;t all have the same zeitgeist, etc. Culturally-driven adaptations, lessons, etc, will be absent or less pronounced in individuals who grew up in cultures which lack them.\nI remember reading this piece by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse war-violence-glorifying film \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn\u0026rsquo;t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo;:\nIt is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?\nHe proposes a bunch of potential counterarguments, then shoots each counterargument down by admitting that the other side would have a symmetrical counterargument of their own: for example, he believes that \u0026ldquo;American Sniper\u0026rdquo; is worse because it\u0026rsquo;s racist and promoting racism is genuinely dangerous to a free society, but then he admits a conservative could say that \u0026ldquo;Fun Home\u0026rdquo; is worse because in their opinion it\u0026rsquo;s homosexuality that\u0026rsquo;s genuinely dangerous to a free society. After three or four levels of this, he ends up concluding that he can\u0026rsquo;t come up with a meta-level fundamental difference, but he\u0026rsquo;s going to fight for his values anyway because they\u0026rsquo;re his. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I think of this conclusion, but my main response to his article is oh my gosh he gets the thing, where \u0026ldquo;the thing\u0026rdquo; is a hard-to-describe ability to understand that other people are going to go down as many levels to defend their self-consistent values as you will to defend yours. It seems silly when I\u0026rsquo;m saying it like this, and you should probably just read the article, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so many people who lack this basic mental operation that this immediately endeared him to me. I would argue Nathan Robinson has a piece of theory-of-mind that a lot of other people are missing.\nActually, I was kind of also thinking this with his most recent post (a), which complains about a Washington Post article (a). The Post argues that because the Democrats support gun control and protest police, they are becoming the \u0026ldquo;pro-crime party\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether the Post genuinely believes the Democrats are pro-crime by inclination or are just arguing their policies will lead to more crime in a hyperbolic figurative way, but I\u0026rsquo;ve certainly seen sources further right make the \u0026ldquo;genuinely in favor of crime as a terminal value\u0026rdquo; argument. And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem too different from the leftist sources that say Republicans can\u0026rsquo;t really care about the lives of the unborn, they\u0026rsquo;re just \u0026ldquo;anti-woman\u0026rdquo; as a terminal value. Both proposals share this idea of not being able to understand that other people have different beliefs than you and that their actions proceed naturally from those beliefs. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,\u0026rdquo; they say \u0026ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.\u0026rdquo;\n(compare: \u0026ldquo;Brayden brought the Skittles bag with him for lunch, so he must enjoy eating pennies.\u0026rdquo; Or: \u0026ldquo;Daddy is refusing to watch Sesame Street with me, so he must be secretly watching it with someone else he likes better instead.\u0026rdquo;)\n[Broken links replaced]\nRelated to this idea: Ian Danskin | Always a Bigger Fish. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure where I fall on this issue. On the one hand, The purpose of a system is what it does. On the other hand, the world is complex and the outcome may not have been entirely understood, predictable, or independent (in that the resulting effect was the result of more than just the single policy). As an example, take the Southern strategy. It\u0026rsquo;s explicit goal was to gain voters by appealing to their racism. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t come right out and say that or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose votes.

For this purpose, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to be right about everything. In fact, we expect most readers to buy only about 70 percent of what we\u0026rsquo;re selling\u0026mdash; and we\u0026rsquo;re OK with that.\nIn some sense, I agree with the thesis, and in another sense I disagree, and overall I gravitate towards this second sense, but after having read the review you may think that I actually gravitate more towards the first one. It can be both things, depending on how one weighs the different agreements and disagreements. I am weighing heavily the core claims and discounting many object level claims. I am also putting some weight behind conceptual clarity and discussion of possible alternative explanations (Side effects of reading too much philosophy!). This last thing does not make me disagree per se, but makes me reduce the strenght of my agreement with a given claim.\nBy where is this disagreement? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that education is -to a large degree - about signaling [Signaling]? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that politics is not just about making policy? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it true that charity is not just about helping others in the most efficient way? Yes, those things are true, but that\u0026rsquo;s not my point. The object-level claims of the book, the claims about how things are are largely correct. It is the interpretation I take issue with.\nWhat is exactly the elephant in the brain?\nThe authors (Simler and Hanson, henceforth SH) say: selfishness, the selfish parts of us. But not quite, they say shortly after. The elephant in the brain is also competition for status, power, and sex, and also misdirection, lies, and self-delusion.\nThese are, note, different things. One can be acting for selfish purposes deliberately instead of \u0026ldquo;unconsciously\u0026rdquo;, for example. Indeed, most of the things we do are done selfishly, for our own goals and purposes. We perhaps don\u0026rsquo;t think about it, but we don\u0026rsquo;t think that we are constantly breathing either, yet we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that we are deluded about breathing.\nThings we do that are not selfish are rare and few: From helping strangers, to donating to charity, to just being nice to people, but note that in some of these there can even be a selfish component to altruistic actions, and it can even be the case that this selfish component can be arranged to serve a non-selfish end, as we will see with the discussion on Effective Altruism.\nEducation The idea here is that the way education works is not so much oriented towards teaching (building up human capital), but towards credentialing: each student has a somewhat fixed ability level (i.e. intelligence, conscientiousness, etc), and being able to go through university certifies that you do have those skills. IQ tests alone wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do, because the sought traits are not just intelligence. Going through 3-5 years of university maintaining consistent high scores not only says you are smart, but that you are willing to devote those smarts to a task, for years, dealing with both subjects you will like and subjects that you will not like: Education doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you a better worker, it reveals how much of a good worker you are [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y]. (Well, it will help somewhat, but you get the idea).\n[\u0026hellip;]\nStudents are happy when classes are canceled because they think classes are inefficient and thus can be compressed. Students at school are there to pass the exams, get high grades, go to uni and get a job, ask any. There is a time T to teach all the material, and if you think, as a student, the efficient time is smaller than T [There\u0026rsquo;s no speed limit], as it was the case when I was at school, then you would be happy if classes are cancelled: it just means you will get more condensed classes afterwards. Exam and learning-wise it is the same, plus you get free time.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nUltimately, we might have these things - I\u0026rsquo;m speculating here, by own admission- because of the aristocratic and then religious origins of modern education. In the past, if you wanted to become a blacksmith, you just learned from your father or became an apprentice at the local guild. Aristocrats had to learn their signaling subjects. Men of religion had to learn grammar, and logic, rhetoric, and latin to engage in theology. When education was then extended to the masses, elites wanted them to have proper values and morals, etc. People might also have been looking upwards at what the elites were doing, and seeing those things as being high status, they became engrained into what education was becoming. Fast forward to the present and we still have some of that present. (This could also be tied with the propaganda explanation)\nAbout students who study the \u0026ldquo;useless\u0026rdquo; subjects like liberal arts mentioned is because, as anyone who has access to Google would know, those subjects get you consumption benefits (People like studying them), and they also get you access to jobs. Are students deluded about the purposes of their education? Not at all! They can honestly think that they study what they like, and that they also gain skills somewhat related to their future employment. A story like \u0026ldquo;I like History so I study it, plus learning History will help me gain a broad understanding of human nature, writing, critical analysis, etc, and this is useful for management or whatever\u0026rdquo; sounds like a plausible reason a History student would give.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo here is the thing: I have agreed with the signaling theory of how education works. I have agreed with the object level claims that education is inefficient, that students forget about what they learn, that much of what schools teach is useless for getting a job and so forth. My disagreement is in the why. We observe and agree about the reality of the same phenomena, but we disagree about the underlying, hard to observe (We would have to engage in some surveying and historical analysis) causes of what we see.\nConfused concepts I\u0026rsquo;m not going to review every single chapter at length, but I\u0026rsquo;ll make in this section a series of remarks about the underlying theory.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTake sex. What is sex about? Why do people engage in sex with protection? It is pleasurable. That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t find this statement controversial: It is the answer most people would give, and if you poked their brains hard enough.\nIt would be odd to see someone saying: No, that\u0026rsquo;s not the real reason: the real reason is reproduction, or bonding, or something, people are hypocrites about why they have sex.\nThis confused use of concepts applies to many of these hidden motives: and it is the basic misunderstanding first year students of evolutionary psychology are taught to avoid: There are ultimate [Ultimate cause] and proximate [Proximate cause] explanations for behaviours. Reproduction may be the ultimate reason why we happen to find sex pleasurable. But pleasure itself and alone is in most cases why people have sex while going to great lengths to avoid conceptions.\nSimilarly, for selfishness, take the case of a parent who does X for her child out of altruism. Again, something saying: \u0026ldquo;it is actually selfishness, X helps propagate certain genes that reward X\u0026rdquo; would be mistaken in their assessment of X as selfish in the standard meaning of selfishness, even if that were correct from a gene-centric perspective.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:riconThisReviewNotReviewingElephantBrain Backlinks Signaling ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/796ad559-ee93-4896-9101-a3395c7dd2d4/","summary":"Jose Luis Ricon, (NO_ITEM_DATA:riconThisReviewNotReviewingElephantBrain)\nSummary A review of Kevin Simler, Robin Hanson | The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life\nThoughts The book is X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y with examples: education, medicine, charity, sex, career, fashion, art etc.\nNotes The book\u0026rsquo;s main thesis can be boiled down to (a)\nOur main goal is to demonstrate that hidden motives are common and important\u0026mdash; that they\u0026rsquo;re more than a minor correction to the alternate theory that people mostly do things for the reasons that they give.","title":"Jose Luis Ricon | This Review Is Not about Reviewing The Elephant in the Brain"},{"content":"Tanner Greer, (Greer 2019)\nNotes Deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him.

This story has a hero. By the end of the tale, the hero has done many great deeds. He (or she) has vanquished some terrific evil, journeyed to some distant place, or protected the innocent multitudes from a cruel fate they did not deserve. In a past age, accomplishing feats such as these was enough to earn the title \u0026lsquo;hero.\u0026rsquo; But this hero comes from a different time. His heroism is not found in the number of enemies he slew, in the distance he traveled, or in the acclaim of his adoring crowds. His heroism is rooted in his character. The relevant aspects of his character are apparent only to his closest friends. Occasionally even they are not privy to the source of his glory, which the audience only learns of because they have privileged access to the hero\u0026rsquo;s internal thoughts. His heroism is grounded in a firm conviction: he does not want to be a hero.\nThe hero wants not fame, nor fortune; he is not motivated by power, nor by revenge. He performs his heroics out of necessity, out of duty, or out of the simple fact that he is the only one on the scene. The hero would rather not be out slaying dragons. He earnestly wishes for a normal life. He yearns for a peaceful and settled world where he is not the chosen one. But it is precisely because our hero lacks ambition that he can be trusted. In a world where men ache for power, we cheer for the protagonist who emphatically rejects it. From beginning to end, our hero\u0026rsquo;s defining trait is a desire not to be a hero. Some are born great, others achieve greatness\u0026mdash;but we love best those blessed few who have had greatness thrust upon them.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ve sketched out an archetypal template. This is the template upon which the vast majority our era\u0026rsquo;s hero-tales are crafted. This is the story of Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, Luke Skywalker, and Jack Ryan. It is Captain America and Spiderman. It is the central trope of science fiction, fantasy, international thrillers, super hero stories, and their \u0026ldquo;YA literature\u0026rdquo; counterparts. It is the myth that drives the imaginations of our times (a).\nFor all of this we have John Ronald Reuel Tolkien to thank. I am sympathetic to the argument that Tolkien is the seminal Anglophone author of the 20th century. Perhaps his literary craft is deft enough to deserves that title. Perhaps it is not. Either way I wager that in a few centuries time when our descendants\u0026rsquo; literary memory has collapsed our age down to one author (as we have done with the ages of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton), Tolkien will be the man remembered. This is not just because Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s works have been fantastically popular, even decades after its first publication, and in cultural milieus quite divorced from its creation. Nor it is because in Tolkien we find the genesis of so many of our era\u0026rsquo;s most popular genres (fantasy, science fiction, role playing games, and so forth). Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s influence is both subtler and more fundamental than this. Tolkien redefined the way popular literature treats many of its most common themes. This post looks at only one of those themes, but I am comfortable with the contention that Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work embodies an entire era\u0026rsquo;s way of understanding the world. It is hard to say if Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Lord of the Rings (a) actually created the central cultural currents of our age or if it is simply their most prominent and enduring incarnation. Either way, Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work is here to stay.\nReaders familiar with Lord of the Rings will immediately see the connections between my opening sketch and the tale of Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s ring-bearer. I am not going to devote an entire essay to this topic\u0026mdash;a great deal has already been written about Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s conception of good and evil, power, corruption, innocence, and heroism, and I see no reason to repeat others\u0026rsquo; feats here\u0026mdash;but I will emphasize two points that deserve strong restatement.\nThe first point: An aversion to glory is not just the defining character trait of the novel\u0026rsquo;s central hero. The distinction between greatness and power as goods to be strived for versus greatness and power as burdens to be carried is the distinction that sets apart almost of all of the novel\u0026rsquo;s protagonists from their foils. It is the defining difference between Frodo and Smeagol, Faramir and Boromir, Aragorn and Denethor, and Gandalf and Saruman. The second trait saves Galadriel in exile; the first corrupts Sauron anew after his master\u0026rsquo;s defeat. If one is allowed to describe objects as foils, this same distinction sets Sauron\u0026rsquo;s rings, key to his strategy for corrupting Middle Earth, as a foil to the methods of the \u0026lsquo;wizards\u0026rsquo; sent from Western lands to save Middle Earth.\nBibliography References Greer, Tanner. 2019. “On The Tolkienic Hero.” The Scholar’s Stage. https://scholars-stage.org/on-the-tolkienic-hero/.

True! In 1950, the American Political Science Association \u0026ldquo;released a call to arms\u0026hellip;pleading for a more polarized political system\u0026rdquo;. The report argued that \u0026ldquo;the parties contain too much diversity of opinion and work together too easily, leaving voters confused about who to vote for and why\u0026rdquo;. Everyone agreed with each other so much, and compromised so readily, that supporting one party over the other seemed almost pointless.\nIn 1976, three years after Roe v. Wade, Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to support abortion restrictions. That same year, a poll found that \u0026ldquo;only 54% of the electorate believed that the Republican Party was more conservative than the Democratic Party\u0026rdquo;; 30% thought there was no difference. As late as 2004 (a), about equal numbers (within 5 pp) of Democrats and Republicans agreed with statements like \u0026ldquo;government is almost always wasteful and inefficient\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;immigrants are a burden on our country\u0026rdquo;. Between the late 60s and early 90s, Democratic presidents deregulated the airlines and passed welfare reform; Republican presidents pushed immigration amnesties and founded the EPA.\nWhat happened between then and now? Klein has two answers: a historical answer, and a structural answer.\nThe historical answer is: the Dixiecrats switched from Democrat to Republican.\nWhen the North won the Civil War, it had grand plans to remake the South into a paradise of racial equality and universal love. After Lincoln\u0026rsquo;s death, his successor Andrew Johnson decided this sounded hard and gave up. Within a few decades, the South was back to being a racist, paramilitary-violence-prone one-party dictatorship. That one party called itself \u0026ldquo;Democrat\u0026rdquo;, but had few similiarites to the Democrats in the North. The Southern Democrats (\u0026ldquo;Dixiecrats\u0026rdquo;) and northern Democrats disagreed on lots of issues, but the South hated the Republicans so much after their experience with Lincoln that they caucused with the northern Democrats anyway. This turned into a stable coalition, with northern Democrats agreeing to support the South against civil rights for blacks, and the Dixiecrats supporting the northern Democrats whenever they needed something.\nBut since the Democratic party contained both northern Democrats (relatively liberal) and Dixiecrats (relatively conservative), it didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take a coherent party-wide stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. And by the median voter theorem, that meant the Republicans also didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take a coherent stance on liberalism vs. conservatism. So both parties ended out centrist and identical.\nIn 1964, the Civil Rights Act threatened the Dixiecrats\u0026rsquo; key issue. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite as simple as \u0026ldquo;Democrats were for it, Republicans were against it\u0026rdquo; - in fact, 80% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats supported it. But that year\u0026rsquo;s presidential election pitted heavily pro-CRA Democrat Lyndon Johnson against anti-CRA Republican Barry Goldwater, beginning Southerners\u0026rsquo; defection to the Republican Party.\nKlein says this successfully got all the conservatives on one side of the aisle and all the liberals on the other, allowing polarization to begin. Essentially, he believes polarization is a natural process, which the odd coalitions of the early 20th century temporarily prevented. Once the coalitions were broken, it could begin to do its work. He spends the rest of the book talking about why exactly polarization is so natural, what aspects of modernization have made it worse, and what sort of feedback loops make it keep going.\nAligned identities don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make people more loyal to their own party; in fact, people are generally less pro-their-own-party than before. In the 1960s, 80% of people were in a political party; nowadays only 63% are. In the 80s, people\u0026rsquo;s average favorability rating for their own party was 72 on a 100 point scale; today it\u0026rsquo;s only 63. So it\u0026rsquo;s not the average voter has suddenly realized their party is great and super-important to them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s that they really, really hate the other guys.\nThis is called negative partisanship [Negative partisanship], and apparently it\u0026rsquo;s the driver of our entire political system.\nKlein argues that although polarization has affected both sides, the Democrats have managed to muddle on, but the Republicans have gone completely off the rails.\nStop for a second before reacting here. I get the impression that Klein understands he is taking a risk (not an actual risk of decreased popularity, given the givens, but some kind of metaphysical risk to his soul) by abandoning his previous attempt at a neutral stance and coming out like this. I think he feels bad about it, and that he considered not writing this chapter on that basis. I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important to him that we consider the possibility that he wants to be neutral, is trying as hard as he can to be neutral, but that even from an attempted-neutral point of view he thinks the decline of the Republican Party is a threat to the stability of the country. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important that we maintain a stance where we recognize this is a potentially true state of affairs - it really is possible that one party is much worse than the other! - and don\u0026rsquo;t automatically condemn Klein for raising the possibility.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut after a bit of this he regains his footing and segues into a stronger argument that might give even conservatives some food for thought. Klein notes that although both Democrats and Republicans have some extremists in their coalition, the institutional Democrats seem to be doing a better job preventing them from gaining power. In a purely structural sense, without getting into whether you believe they\u0026rsquo;re morally equivalent or whatever, the democratic socialists/Bernie Sanders seem to be an \u0026ldquo;insurrection\u0026rdquo; comparable to the Tea Party/Trump on the Republican side. But the mainstream neoliberal Republicans surrendered to the Tea Party and to Trump in rapid succession, and the mainstream neoliberal Democrats are still resisting. The Democrats\u0026rsquo; Tea Party equivalent is probably AOC, but she and her allies are still a small minority in the Democratic caucus. And the Dem presidential nomination went to Joe Biden, a moderate who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t look out of place running for president in 1988 (in fact\u0026hellip;). Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized was published too early to mention Biden in this context, but we can count him as a correct prediction for its theory.\nKlein calls this \u0026ldquo;the Democratic party more successfully resisting polarization\u0026rdquo;, and thinks of this as related to structural differences between the two parties. He says that the Republican Party represents the modal American on various characteristics, eg Christian (the most common religion), white (the most common race), straight (the most common sexual orientation), etc, whereas the Democrats represent everyone else (eg Muslims, Jews, atheists, and every minority religion; blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and every minority race; etc). That means the Republicans are more ideologically uniform - Christians are genuinely similar to other Christians, but Jews are only superficially similar to Muslims by virtue of their non-Christianness. That means ideology can\u0026rsquo;t really capture the Democratic Party in the same way it captures the Republican Party. One point kind of in support of this - ask Democrats their favorite news source, and you get a long tail of stuff (most popular is CNN at 15%, then NPR at 13%, and so on). But ask conservatives and it\u0026rsquo;s dominated by FOX (47%). Does this lack of news-source diversity reflect a lack of ideological diversity? Could be.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nKlein understands he\u0026rsquo;s supposed to end the book with a collection of suggestions for how to be less polarized. He is not sure he wants to do this. Nonpolarization rested on a gentleman\u0026rsquo;s agreement to continue racism, which was bad. Voters benefit from having two clear alternatives to choose from. We Should Not Take A Rosy-Eyed View Of An Idealized Past. Plus he isn\u0026rsquo;t sure we could end polarization even if we wanted to.\nBut he suggests we also do some things to make sure polarization doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause national collapse or a civil war or something. He suggests fixing the Supreme Court (eg having more justices, with fixed-year terms) so that there aren\u0026rsquo;t constant crises about who gets to pick the swing vote. He wants to do something about the debt ceiling and other \u0026ldquo;ticking time bombs\u0026rdquo; where if the parties don\u0026rsquo;t agree, it causes some kind of disaster. And he suggests granting statehood to Puerto Rico and DC, because the better the electoral calculus is for the Democrats, the more the Republicans will have to change their strategy, and maybe their new strategy won\u0026rsquo;t involve them being evil racists, and then the Democrats won\u0026rsquo;t have to be so justly and correctly polarized against them (am I being unfair? check page 257 and see for yourself).\nFinally, he suggests some increased individual reflectivity and thoughtfulness on our own parts. If all of us just do a tiny bit each day to fight the polarization within ourselves, together we can form a growing tide of compassion and mutual understanding. Haha, yeah right.\nThis hit basically the notes a book like this should hit, but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel too much more enlightened about Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeRePolarized2020 NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewWhyWeRePolarized2021 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/8514d260-eb32-4b31-8559-6cd8990dfc06/","summary":"Ezra Klein, (NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewWhyWeRePolarized2021)\nSummary Book review of (NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeRePolarized2020).\nThoughts While I haven\u0026rsquo;t read (NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeRePolarized2020), this reivew leads me to the conclusion that it\u0026rsquo;s a blown out version of Ezra Klein | Why We Can\u0026rsquo;t Build.\nNotes Did you know that seventy years ago, our grandparents were having an underpolarization crisis?

Nonetheless I\u0026rsquo;d have preferred a more explicit conclusion. The gist, as I see it based on reading (read: skimming) the piece:\nThe benefits of Direct Instruction are most relevant for low-socioeconomic-status learners and those educationally disadvantaged Mastery learning\u0026rsquo;s benefits are likely derived from it\u0026rsquo;s implicit use of the Testing effect Spaced repetition is indeed very effective A key question of education is \u0026ldquo;What should we learn?\u0026rdquo; and not only \u0026ldquo;How can we learn more effectively/faster/better/etc?\u0026rdquo;. As an example: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the effect size of removing history from the curriculum and leaving more time for the kids to play?\u0026rdquo; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to remove history but that idea, \u0026ldquo;What are the opportunity costs of our curriculum\u0026rdquo;, are valuable. Notes Why would mastery learning work? Some proposed experiments Suppose that something by the name \u0026ldquo;The Incredible Learning Method\u0026rdquo; or TILM has been shown to increase performance by d=0.5. One then wonders what TILM is. TILM consists on doing spaced repetition and doing pushups every day.\nShould we then recommend that kids do pushups if they want to learn? Or should we find what, ultimately, causes TILM to work?\nIn this approach, we break down a method into its components and experiment with them separately, or together by parts, seeing what effects we find. Then, we could try to study how each of the subcomponents behaves in other samples, or try to find neuroscience-level explanations for them.\nFor spaced repetition, the answer here would be the underlying idea of there being a forgetting curve (a) which in turn might be possible to explain by some feature of how the brain works at a low level.\nIn fact, could it be that mastery learning is spaced repetition in disguise?\nOr, it could also be that the thing doing the trick is just more time: If we assume that the more exposed one is to a concept more one learns it (with perhaps some plateau at the end), then the fact that a student keeps studying over and over the same material would increase performance. If so, mastery learning wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have an effect if one controls for time invested in instruction. As Slavin puts it:\nIn an extreme form, the central contentions of mastery learning theory are almost tautologically true. If we establish a reasonable set of learning objectives and demand that every student achieve them at a high level regardless of how long that takes, then it is virtually certain that all students will ultimately achieve that criterion.\nOr, it could also be that it is just the testing that is doing the work. Recall, mastery learning is a study-test-feedback-corrective loop. Slavin found that the study-test-feedback loop works almost as well. But we also know that study-test also works! This is known as the testing effect (a).\nOr, it could also be that mastering lesson N does have an impact on better absorbing the knowledge in lessons N+i. If so, a way to study this would be teaching a group with mastery learning and another with regular methods one lesson, then teaching both groups with regular methods lesson 2. If mastery learning works, then the group of students that originally was taught with mastery learning should get better results. This is, it seems to me, the only genuine \u0026ldquo;mastery\u0026rdquo; effect.\nConclusion Bloom noted that mastery learning had an effect size of around 1 (one sigma); while tutoring leads to d=2. This is mostly an outlier case.\nNonetheless, Bloom was on to something: Tutoring and mastery learning do have a degree of experimental support, and fortunately it seems that carefully designed software systems can completely replace the instructional side of traditional teaching, achieving better results, on par with one to one tutoring. However, designing them is a hard endeavour, and there is a motivational component of teachers that may not be as easily replicable purely by software.\nOverall, it\u0026rsquo;s good news that the effects are present for younger and older students, and across subjects, but the effect sizes of tutoring, mastery learning or DI are not as good as they would seem from Bloom\u0026rsquo;s paper. That said, it is true that tutoring does have large effect sizes, and that properly designed software does as well. The DARPA case study shows what is possible with software tutoring, in the case the effect sizes went even beyond Bloom\u0026rsquo;s paper.\n[\u0026hellip;] Mastery learning, it seems, works by overfitting to a test, and the chances that those skills do not generalise are nontrivial.\nCoda: What should you learn I have been discussing above learning methods. But what about learning content? What should one learn? Bryan Caplan, in his book The Case Against Education10 argues that skills are not very transferable: you get good at what you do, and you quickly forget everything else. This informed my priors when looking at the mastery learning literature; and so I was not that surprised to find the issue with the kinds of tests I outlined in my section on Slavin.\nCaplan is right, and this opens an avenue to improve teaching: Suppose you focus on the very basics that will most likely be useful to the students in the future (reading, writing, mathematics). With the time freed up from not teaching other subjects, one can both help disadvantaged students get good at those core topics, and let non-disadvantaged students use the extra time to learn about whatever they want. I would even suggest let them go home, but it may be argued one of the implicit roles of school is that of a place to keep the kids while the parents are working, a kindergarten for older children, but if parents are okay letting their kids roam around, and cities are safe, this is not an issue. Definitely worth exploring.\nGranting that one can use DI to hammer down very basic points, should one also hammer down History and English Literature? Just because you can make the learning of those happen doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should: the effectiveness of an intervention also depends on the values being used to judge it. What\u0026rsquo;s the effect size of removing History from the curriculum and leaving more time for the kids to play?\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:riconBloomTwoSigmaProblemSystematicReviewEffectivenessMasteryLearningTutoring2019 Backlinks Jose Luis Ricon | On Building ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/05f362b2-ab02-4cfb-9185-aae4e1c9e235/","summary":"Jose Luis Ricon, (NO_ITEM_DATA:riconBloomTwoSigmaProblemSystematicReviewEffectivenessMasteryLearningTutoring2019)\nThoughts Wordcount: 13459 | Reading time: 72 min\nI suppose I should have expected that with a title that includes \u0026ldquo;systematic review\u0026rdquo;.

Schwarzenegger had a plan in place to address pandemics like the current one, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a plan, the equipment required was actually manufactured and subsequently purchased.\nThe state, flush with tax revenue (a), soon sunk more than $200 million into the mobile hospital program and a related Health Surge Capacity Initiative to stockpile medicines and medical gear for use in outbreaks of infectious disease, according to former emergency management officials and state budget records.\nBut then\nBut the ambitious effort, which would have been vital as the state confronts the new coronavirus today, hit a wall: a brutal recession, a free fall in state revenues \u0026ndash; and in 2011, the administration of a fiscally minded Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, who came into office facing a $26 billion deficit.\nAnd so, that year, the state cut off the money to store and maintain the stockpile of supplies and the mobile hospitals. The hospitals were defunded before they\u0026rsquo;d ever been used.\nMuch of the medical equipment \u0026ndash; including the ventilators, critical life-saving tools that are in short supply in the current pandemic \u0026ndash; was given to local hospitals and health agencies, former health officials said. But the equipment was donated without any funding to maintain them. The respirators were allowed to expire without being replaced.\nNow one may wonder what can be done to avoid this entire class of mistakes. Sure enough, becoming a prepper society is not the most efficient thing there is, but if you are going to predictably have impredictable shocks (As to the when and what exactly) that affect everyone, you probably need those emergency plans. So the working assumption should be that there will be a next global pandemic for sure, what is unknown is what virus and where it will come from, but it will come. There will be plenty of time to plan and build and prepare, but those preparations have to be maintained over time.\nDeath by friction Finance is another of the topics touched on by the article; the fact that the US government can be paid by everyone but not easily pay everyone probably shares something with the US tax hell; in at least the UK there is no need to think about taxes for most people the government knows everything they need to know about you anyway so they are paid for you. In the US it is the same case - that\u0026rsquo;s why tax fraud is a thing, they are double checking your work for no good reason. In the UK I was once taxed in excess. As the meme goes, you won\u0026rsquo;t believe what happened next; I just had to log-in in a -nicely- designed website, write my bank account details in a box and two days later I was refunded. Just like that. No need for complex forms, any paperwork, phone calls, or anything of the sort.\nSkyscrapers, fast and slow You don\u0026rsquo;t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.\nYou see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u0026rsquo;t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can\u0026rsquo;t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Westworld\u0026rdquo; wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn\u0026rsquo;t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\n(Andreessen 2020)\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it is smug complacency. There is some complacency, to be sure, though I don\u0026rsquo;t know how smug it is. There is no demand for smartphones unless Apple shows up; or there is no demand for fast email apps until Superhuman shows up. Once you see 90 Hz refresh rates on screens you didn\u0026rsquo;t know you wanted it. There is no demand for the future until the future is here.\nIn housing it\u0026rsquo;s not complacency either. Take San Francisco. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t San Francisco outcompeting Singapore at skypscraper building? It\u0026rsquo;s illegal to build. Okay, but why? After all San franciscoans do want more housing, it\u0026rsquo;s not just the tech bros who rant on twitter about it. Once it is possible to build those gleaming skyscrapers, the US does not do bad compared to other countries, the need for national flagellation here is rather moderate. So here it\u0026rsquo;s not that the real state developers are lazy and complacent, it\u0026rsquo;s that the political structures of, in this case, San Francisco, are captured by a politically organized minority who does not want density and skyscrapers. That\u0026rsquo;s not a problem of not building, but of not allowing building in the first place: politics and regulation. [\u0026hellip;]\nAt first a reaction I can imagine to the piece may be that focus on skyscrapers may be misguided; while they have some intrinsic appeal as unique works of art - a reason skyscrapers are so expensive is that each one tends to be an artisanal, one of a kind piece, not a mass-market product - they are demanded because they enable economies of scale in cities but in turn those exist because we are not pushing hard enough for remote work. The right ideal would thus be not skyscrapers but nice walkable cities and work from home, which while they appeal less to the futuristically inclined, is what people actually would prefer. However that critique would be misplaced: With skyscrapers and faster transportation, life in the city becomes compatible with life in a spacious house with an ample garden, so you can fluidly decide where you want to live.\nEducation You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing education research that\u0026rsquo;s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven\u0026rsquo;t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?\n(Andreessen 2020)\nOne answer to why not do all the things we have learned is because very little works. I wrote a longer research essay on Bloom\u0026rsquo;s two sigma (a) [Jose Luis Ricon | On Bloom\u0026rsquo;s Two Sigma Problem] and education research in general and the conclusion one gets from it is that researching better ways to learn is hard. Bloom\u0026rsquo;s two sigma is more like Bloom\u0026rsquo;s one sigma, at best, though there is promise in software-based methods to complement or even replace teachers. It remains a puzzle why large public education systems have not deployed these systems at scale; for them developing software tutoring is a one-off cost - the content of what is taught changes very little -, so presumably this may have to do with either lack of knowledge that these systems are possible, or opposition from within the system itself (again, politics).\nThe emphasis on more universities is also misplaced; those top end universities are to a large extent accreditation systems (a) [Jose Luis Ricon | Notes on The Case Against Education] for those already skilled. Sure you can scale up Harvard to educate 1000x more people but I doubt that will yield anywhere near 1000x more patents, companies, or research coming out of the expanded set of alumni.\nThe P-word I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u0026rsquo;s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There\u0026rsquo;s an excellent chance I\u0026rsquo;ll agree with you.\nWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t intend this to be a critique of Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s essay; in fact I agree with its spirit; I think the more interesting question is Why aren\u0026rsquo;t thing being built? Why aren\u0026rsquo;t things being built faster than they are? What are the mechanistic forces at play in each sector?. My thesis is that the mentality of improvement - to put it in Anton Howes (a)\u0026rsquo; terms- has not been lost; rather the frictions in going from zero to curing cancer have increased.\nBut what should be built. Look at any organization that has been around for a long time. Is it a law of nature that, as they age, organizations degrade in function and stop making the most efficient use of resources, making their replacement a necessity4 (a)? Take the entire world\u0026rsquo;s space launch sector. For decades we launched rockets and threw them away; sure there were proof of concepts (a) that showed that avoiding this engineering form of economic masochism was achievable but the idea of reusing rockets didn\u0026rsquo;t really became a thing until SpaceX (a) came in.\nWhat better regulation could look like [\u0026hellip;] imagine if you had, in the US, FDA competitors (regulated by a Meta-FDA); one could for example scrap the Phase I/II/III trial system and have relaxed requirements on a case-by-case basis. Any proposal on accelerating drug-to-market could be tried. One would have to design the meta-regulations carefully so as to line up incentives to balance safety and innovation [\u0026hellip;]\nSounds like an adversarial relationship like a Generative adversarial network.\nBibliography References Andreessen, Marc. 2020. “It’s Time to Build.” Andreessen Horowitz. https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/.

Doint so requires a certain amount of power consolidation since spreading power too thin leads to the vetocracy discussed below. I also agree that people don\u0026rsquo;t like this sort of work \u0026ndash; what Klein calls \u0026ldquo;[Meta]-building\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions\u0026rdquo;.\nNotes I think Andreessen is uncharacteristically underestimating the appetite for building. The absence of creation doesn\u0026rsquo;t reflect an absence of desire \u0026mdash; even in that epicenter of supposed stagnation, Washington, DC.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve covered Congress for almost 20 years. The place is littered with proposals to construct universal pre-K (a) and reimagine the health system (a), to decarbonize the US economy (a) and incentivize drug development through prizes (a) and solve the housing crisis (a). They just don\u0026rsquo;t pass. It\u0026rsquo;s become a running joke (a) in Washington that every week is \u0026ldquo;infrastructure week.\u0026rdquo; But we\u0026rsquo;re not rebuilding American infrastructure.\nThe question, then, is why don\u0026rsquo;t we build? What\u0026rsquo;s stopping us?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my answer: The institutions through which Americans build have become biased against action rather than toward it. They\u0026rsquo;ve become, in political scientist Francis Fukuyama\u0026rsquo;s term (a), \u0026ldquo;vetocracies,\u0026rdquo; in which too many actors have veto rights over what gets built. That\u0026rsquo;s true in the federal government. It\u0026rsquo;s true in state and local governments. It\u0026rsquo;s even true in the private sector.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not against soliciting more ideas of what to build. But what we need is sustained funding, focus, and organizing to make building in America possible again. And that requires patiently engaging with the kinds of institutions that frustrate builders.\nThe federal vetocracy That the US government has become a dysfunctional vetocracy is obvious. Hell, I wrote a whole book (a) [Ezra Klein | Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized] about it. But in short: America\u0026rsquo;s system of checks and balances requires unusual and even extraordinary levels of consensus to pass legislation. First, you need the agreement of the House, the Senate, the White House, and, increasingly, the Supreme Court.\nMore granularly, congressional power is diffused across committees. The Senate has built in a supermajority requirement, known as the filibuster, which effectively raises the threshold for passage from 51 votes to 60 votes.\nThis raises the question: If the problem is embedded in the structure of the US government, how did the US ever do anything big? The short answer is that for most of our political history, two unusual conditions held. First, the parties were ideologically mixed, which made compromise easier. Second, one party was usually electorally dominant (a), which gave the party in the minority a reason to compromise: If you can\u0026rsquo;t win, you may as well deal.\nBoth those conditions have dissolved. America\u0026rsquo;s political parties are more ideologically \u0026mdash; and demographically \u0026mdash; polarized than ever before. We\u0026rsquo;re also in the most competitive period American politics has ever seen. In a system like that, both sides utilize the system\u0026rsquo;s bias toward inaction to foil their opponents. You can see this in the rise of the filibuster over time. The rule has been around almost as long as America, but it\u0026rsquo;s only been deployed as an omnipresent veto in recent decades:\nThe result is a system biased toward inaction. The left can\u0026rsquo;t remake American health care. The right can\u0026rsquo;t voucherize American schools. The left can\u0026rsquo;t pass a climate bill. The right can\u0026rsquo;t privatize Social Security. Neither side can rewrite our immigration laws, hence the turn towards oscillating executive orders. Neither side can pass their infrastructure packages. Neither side can reform social insurance.\nIn the midst of a pandemic, a financial crisis, or a terrorist attack, emergency measures can pass, for a little while, but absent some kind of crisis, paralysis is the rule. (This is a sketch, and it ignores some important party asymmetries, so read the book (a) if you want to dig deeper into how polarization makes American ungovernable.)\nThe state and local vetocracy If paralysis ended once you walked out of the Capitol, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a housing crisis. We\u0026rsquo;d have better social insurance infrastructure. We\u0026rsquo;d have better infrastructure, period. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMarc Dunkelman spent years cataloging (a) the many failures to revamp Penn Station, a number of which came complete with hefty doses of federal funding. Each time, the story was the same: Plenty of people who wanted to build, and plenty of money with which to build, but too many people with vetoes who simply didn\u0026rsquo;t want the building to happen.\nThis is representative democracy at its worst: A democracy that only represents those who know to show up at meetings most people never hear about, and so ends up handing power to special interests and aggrieved NIMBYs. I highly recommend this Weeds podcast (a) on \u0026ldquo;neighborhood defenders\u0026rdquo; and the way participatory local processes favor the status quo for more on that dynamic.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs Dunkelman puts it, \u0026ldquo;in New York, and in other cities, government power is now spread so thin that places once incapable of stopping bad projects now cannot get good projects off the ground.\u0026rdquo; That applies far more broadly, of course, than just city governance.\nThe capitalist vetocracy But some of Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s examples really can\u0026rsquo;t be blamed on the government, at least not in a traditional sense.\nAmerica doesn\u0026rsquo;t have more ICU beds because hospitals have budgets to balance. You can\u0026rsquo;t both run a profitable hospital and maintain enough spare capacity for a once-in-a-century pandemic.\nSimilarly, the companies that make ventilators are private companies. They didn\u0026rsquo;t make more ventilators because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t demand for more ventilators. Same goes for surgical masks, eye shields, hospital gowns. Now, you can argue the government should\u0026rsquo;ve been stockpiling more of this stuff all along \u0026mdash; and definitely should have been ramping up production in January and February \u0026mdash; but a capitalist logic of efficiency prevails both inside and outside the market.\nTake, for instance, the wildly successful Obama administration program to loan money to renewable energy companies that became infamous because one of those companies, Solyndra, was a bust. That program led to a slew of successes (a) (including Tesla (a)) and turned a profit (a) to taxpayers. As Michael Lewis argues at length in his book The Fifth Risk (a), the problem, if anything, was that it was too cautious \u0026mdash; so afraid of a Solyndra-like story that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t funding sufficiently risky investments. But they proved right to be afraid.\nIf even the government is forced to turn a constant profit on its programs and to avoid anything that might look like a boondoggle, you can imagine the pressure actual private companies are under. CEOs of all kinds of companies lament \u0026ldquo;short-termism (a).\u0026rdquo; Startup theorist Eric Ries has even gotten SEC approval for a \u0026ldquo;long-term stock exchange (a)\u0026rdquo; meant to ease the problem.\nIn practice, short-term shareholder capitalism acts as a kind of vetocracy on public companies: If the market thinks whatever you\u0026rsquo;re doing is going to cut quarterly earning for an uncertain payoff, it can punish you severely, and instantly, for trying. There are CEOs like Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Jeff Bezos who\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get themselves a longer leash, but they\u0026rsquo;re the exceptions that infuriate the rules.\nWe need to rebuild institutions I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;ll be enough. So let me end with my answer to Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s question: What should we build? We should build institutions biased toward action [Bias toward action] and ambition, rather than inaction and incrementalism.\nBut that means doing the difficult work of reforming existing institutions that aren\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere. You can\u0026rsquo;t sidestep the existence of the government, as too many in Silicon Valley want to do. You have to engage with it. You have to muster the political power to rebuild parts of it. And then you need to use the government to make markets competitive again.\nAt the federal level, I\u0026rsquo;d get rid of the filibuster, simplify the committee system, democratize elections, and make sure majorities could implement their agendas once elected. As I\u0026rsquo;ve argued for years, we should prefer the problems of a system where elected majorities can fulfill the promises that got them elected to one where elected majorities cannot deliver on the promises that the American people voted for. The latter system, which is the one Americans live in now, drives frustration and dysfunction.\nBut legislators on both sides prefer the status quo because it gives them power when they\u0026rsquo;re in the minority, and because they\u0026rsquo;re more afraid of what their opponents might do than committed to what they\u0026rsquo;ve promised to do. The allure of what they could build isn\u0026rsquo;t as powerful as the fear of what the other side may build.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll let others make granular recommendations at the state, local, and market levels. But whatever the recommendations, the same thing is needed: A sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions. [Meta]-building isn\u0026rsquo;t a popular pastime, and the patient, focused work it requires is particularly frustrating, in my experience, to entrepreneurial personalities.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeCanBuild2020 Backlinks Scott Alexander | Book Review: Why We\u0026rsquo;re Polarized Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/2ff2cbd5-43a3-4c54-bb11-d7e4f34a0bfc/","summary":"Ezra Klein, (NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeCanBuild2020)\nThoughts I agree with Klein\u0026rsquo;s conclusion that the overall solution is one which reforms, deconstructs, and creates new institutions biased toward action rather than inaction.

When we look around us, we see a world littered with the physical and institutional detritus of past failures\u0026mdash;with depressingly little to show for any recent action, whatsoever. Political and legal sclerosis grip our governing bodies from the national legislature to city governments, and they smother our ability to build anything at all. The only choice we seem able to make anymore is the choice not to make anything. The American built environment has ossified, preserving our stagnation in amber; those looking to the future now look elsewhere\u0026mdash;to science fiction and fantasy, perhaps. It is undeniable that we are undergoing a crisis of will\u0026mdash;and that nearly everything around us in America cuts against the impulse to build a future. But is there really capability to do so, strangled by our current system, waiting to be unshackled? And must we somehow transcend politics to unleash it?\nIf we want to succeed in rebuilding the nation, we will need not just the destruction of existing barriers but the construction of positive political goals. In this light, Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s answer to the question of politics is quite strange. What does it mean to \u0026ldquo;separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics\u0026rdquo;? One can imagine Bay Area tech entrepreneurs nodding along to this essay, wishing that politics and the pesky state would just leave them alone to BUILD. This would be a fatal mistake.\nTo be sure, we must circumvent our current political paradigm. Yet this is not a separation from politics qua politics\u0026mdash;it is politics. Building a new world is the most political question imaginable. Attempting to ignore the state in order to circumvent it only worsened its dysfunctionality; counterintuitively, it also led to administrative bloat, as a government replete with nonfunctional institutions is compelled to expand (a) as new problems emerge over time. Attempting to transcend the political with flashy Harvard Business School applied-management techniques and productivity enhancer apps is a surefire way to repeat the stagnation of the 1970s and the substance-free marketing of the 1990s. Silicon Valley must recognize that it is optimized for a dysfunctional national ecosystem, and it is in everyone\u0026rsquo;s interest to realize this and push for broader societal reinvigoration. Short of this, we are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\nTo regain the will to build for real, we must first recognize where we chose to give it up in the first place. At the end of the Cold War, still armed to the teeth with ideological weapons to fight the Soviets, we looked out blinkingly over our sprawling empire (also known as \u0026ldquo;the liberal international order\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the global economy\u0026rdquo;) and fell on our sword. The doctrines of free trade and market fundamentalism were useful ideological bludgeons against communism, but they also proved just as devastating to our own system when we unwittingly turned them against (a) ourselves.\nAs a result, we chose not only to ignore the maintenance of vital production but also to intentionally disintegrate much of our advanced industrial capacity. The heady techno-optimist 1990s saw legions of McKinsey consultants setting about touting (a) flashy \u0026ldquo;unbundling\u0026rdquo; schemes to dismember the supposedly archaic core of American industry. We attempted a total separation of production from the political, in the name of increased consumption and gains from trade. Questions of community well-being or geopolitical interest were waved away or even crushed. Under this ideology, no distinction can be made between a billion dollars in GDP generated from Netflix consumption and a billion dollars in GDP generated by domestic machine tool production. Nor does it permit us to discern which sectors are vital to retain and which can be safely offshored.\nOnce we finally set about trying to rebuild American industrial capacity, we may be in for a nasty surprise. We might not have the capability anymore to simply turn industry back on. Functional industry requires a great deal of implicit knowledge that is not easily regained once traditions of manufacturing die out—like a master dying before they can find an apprentice to teach. With the material death of advanced heavy industry comes the death of once-functional institutional ecosystems, taking with them to the grave the tacit intellectual code [Tacit knowledge] that they run on.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere has yet to be a post-industrial society that has re-industrialized. America should be the first. But this is a much taller order than applying will to current capacity: we also must rebuild capabilities. Building functional industry (a) takes massive up-front investment in processes with uncertain payoffs and long time horizons. Silicon Valley VCs may continue to seed new product startups, but when it comes time to produce their products \u0026ldquo;at scale,\u0026rdquo; these firms are invariably forced to move overseas. Most of these startups are far downstream of industrial fundamentals anyway. Capital\u0026rsquo;s time preference has been far too short to combat this dynamic (a), and there is no reason to believe that it can or should play the primary role. In fact, every single country to industrialize has done so with the guidance of the state (a), marshaling huge quantities of R\u0026amp;D funding and enforcing strict export discipline to wean the infant industries in which it invests.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:wilksItTimeBuildGood2020 Backlinks Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/69494a1d-7a68-48d6-87dd-3f664106e9d3/","summary":"TODO_AUTHOR, (NO_ITEM_DATA:wilksItTimeBuildGood2020)\nNotes The broad thrust of Andreessen\u0026rsquo;s critique rings true.

The hate was palpable.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what policies I would pursue if I was in a position of power with regard to changes and innovations in the public space. I\u0026rsquo;m sympathetic to arguments against unaccountable companies dropping hundreds of scooters across the city and the disturbance.\nThere is an emerging political consciousness in Silicon Valley. Technologists are advancing a new way of understanding the challenges facing America and how to solve them that do not split neatly along the traditional left right axis. However, to implement change along those new lines, there must be a will.\nThe \u0026ldquo;X isn\u0026rsquo;t left or right\u0026rdquo;, in my experience, tends to mean \u0026ldquo;X is mostly right, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound as good to our audience\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps this one is different or perhaps my view is incomplete because \u0026ldquo;traditional left right axis\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a firm definition.\nInstitution building is a political act and needs to be understood as such. Tech giants like Google have figured out how to lobby effectively for their own interests. However, that parochial view of protecting one\u0026rsquo;s domain is no longer enough. There instead needs to be a push, a demand, for a broader set of pro-innovation reforms.\nIt is not enough, however, to simply call for reforms. There must be specifics. How is the current regulatory environment stifling innovation? How is NEPA limiting infrastructure? How is the FDA limiting drug development? After the specifics comes politics.\nThe first step to politics is the same first step that a technical founder takes when hiring their first salesperson. Just call up the best political operatives you know and learn everything you can about political influence. It is possible that much of the traditional mechanisms of political influence, think tanks, lobbyists, and media, are outdated. However, there is still much value there. It\u0026rsquo;s worth approaching with an open mind to figure out what can be improved and what works well.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nHowever, part of politics will also include building new institutions. Who is creating the Y Combinator for institution builders? Who is funding their intellectual development and empowering them with a network to execute it?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGetting there, however, requires politics. It is not enough to build apps. We must build institutions.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:lutterBuildInstitutionsNotApps Backlinks Marc Andreessen | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/a3d2b0f5-daff-4aef-9c5f-e34ab410efa6/","summary":"Mark Lutter, (NO_ITEM_DATA:lutterBuildInstitutionsNotApps)\nSummary As my friend Samo Burja likes to quip, \u0026ldquo;Silicon Valley likes to think they\u0026rsquo;re above politics while in fact they\u0026rsquo;re below it\u0026rdquo;.\nNotes As my friend Samo Burja likes to quip, \u0026ldquo;Silicon Valley likes to think they\u0026rsquo;re above politics while in fact they\u0026rsquo;re below it\u0026rdquo;.\nThe result is San Francisco electing a District Attorney, Chesa Boudin, who worked for Hugo Chavez (a).\nMy tribal biases are showing.","title":"Mark Lutter | Build Institutions, Not Apps"},{"content":"Tanner Greer, (Greer 2020)\nSummary Thoughts Notes Bibliography References Greer, Tanner. 2020. “On Cultures That Build.” The Scholar’s Stage. https://scholars-stage.org/on-cultures-that-build/.

This essay puts forward a good, albeit vague and almost-too-encompasing, definition of one of our problems: America isn\u0026rsquo;t building enough and we\u0026rsquo;re suffering because of it. The next steps are identifying why we aren\u0026rsquo;t building, what we need to build, how we can build it, and generally constructing a Theory of change for the future in which we can and do build.\nResponses Tanner Greer | On Cultures That Build Mark Lutter | Build Institutions, Not Apps Jose Luis Ricon | On Building Isaac Wilks | It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Build for Good Ezra Klein | Why We Can\u0026rsquo;t Build Thoughts Bias toward action Our Systems are slow to move and biased against change. This isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a problem provided we couple these slow moving systems and institutions with an attitude of preparedness so we have processes ready for when we need them. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if a pandemic response took many years to develop if it\u0026rsquo;s ready before the pandemic occurs (and, I suppose, that the process is still relevant and viable at that time). The problem is that we lack preparedness \u0026ndash; our vision only extends a few years at most; rarely if ever beyond our own lifetimes. Slow start-up and slow iteration time lead to slow development X isn\u0026rsquo;t your fault but Y is your responsibility Notes Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it\u0026rsquo;s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.\nMany of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed — no Western country, or state, or city was prepared — and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.\nPart of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the other part of the problem is what we didn\u0026rsquo;t \\*do\\* in advance, and what we\u0026rsquo;re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our widespread inability to \\*build\\*.\nWe see this today with the things we urgently need but don\u0026rsquo;t have:\ncoronavirus tests test materials — including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents surgical masks eye shields medical gowns therapies or a vaccine — despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses the manufacturing factories required to scale [the therapy or vaccine\u0026rsquo;s] production the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it [paraphrasing, formatting mine]\nWhy do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to — specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to \\*build\\*.\nYou see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can\u0026rsquo;t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can\u0026rsquo;t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Westworld\u0026rdquo; wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn\u0026rsquo;t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\nI disagree that gleaming skyscrapers are the emblem of an advanced city but that\u0026rsquo;s beside the point. San Francisco, and the Bay Area in general, has a horrible housing situation which prices out all but (1) the rich, (2) those who were here early (i.e Prop 13 (NO_ITEM_DATA:1978CaliforniaProposition132022)), and (3) those willing to lower their standard of living by doubling or tripling up, etc. I agree with the phrasing of \u0026ldquo;choosing\u0026rdquo; not to build. Councils in the Bay Area have chosen housing stagnation by not choosing agressive housing policies to keep pace with the population and demand growth. Then again, I am sympathetic to the idea that \u0026ldquo;just because people want to come here doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we need to change to facilitate that demand\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I\u0026rsquo;d handle the situation if I were to become BDFL as I\u0026rsquo;d inherit existing infrastructure and buildings with users and owners both happy and unhappy, as well as not enough money to push through truly dramatic changes. One change I\u0026rsquo;d love to make would be to radically restrict car transport throughout the Bay Area in favor of reliable, safe, clean, etc, public transport in the form of trains, light rail, and buses. I\u0026rsquo;d need to couple this with a similarly radical densification to facilitiate that public transportation. This would involve demolishing existing single-family homes, etc, and building denser housing options. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be immediately popular or profitable and would get me laughed out of the room before work even got started.\nYou see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing education research that\u0026rsquo;s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect [Bloom\u0026rsquo;s 2 sigma problem]); we have the internet; why haven\u0026rsquo;t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success?\nSee Evidence-based education.\nYou see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know — and we\u0026rsquo;re experiencing right now! — the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.\nI\u0026rsquo;d assumed capital moved manufacturing offshore because doing so was cheaper than the automation Marc suggests we embrace. Knowing the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing and doing it anyway is a Coordination problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not something any single person can solve \u0026ndash; even in government. You need buy-in from multiple parties each of whom would receive individual benefits from defecting (moving manufacturing offshore) (Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma, Tragedy of the commons).\nYou see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?\nTo address specific points:\nSupersonic aircraft aren\u0026rsquo;t better than the aircraft we have now \u0026ndash; it takes more and more fuel to fly even a little bit faster. Current air travel optimizes along that curve to move more for less. High speed trains: Yes, 100%. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have trains!? Hyperloops: They were, in my opinion of course, introduced amid peak Elon hype to derail (pun intended) policical ambition in high-speed rail and public \u0026ndash; not private! \u0026ndash; transportation. Flying cars: I don\u0026rsquo;t trust anyone I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met on the road in a flying car That said, yes, I continue to broadly agree that we have chosen not to \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo;.\nIs the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I\u0026rsquo;m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don\u0026rsquo;t know — all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have.\nMy bias toward thinking Systems are the problem does bristle when he moves past the idea that our primary economic system might be at fault. Capitalism isn\u0026rsquo;t the only problem but it is part, and I\u0026rsquo;d say a large part, of the problem. Capitalism:\nconcentrates power in the hands of the few \u0026ndash; the very people who most benefit from a system will be reluctant to make dramatic changes to that system encourages short-term thinking (Tragedy of the commons; Moloch) on timescales less, sometimes much less, than a single human lifetime The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.\nThe left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge — build new things and show the results!\nShow that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective — how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can\u0026rsquo;t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building — energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let\u0026rsquo;s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest?\nAgreed. I\u0026rsquo;m tired of the American left (read: Democrats, not the actual left) whining rather than getting things done (related: You go high, we go low and The left has no place it wants to go). While they get some things done, and I am sympathetic to the structural imbalances which hinder them (e.g. congressional bias toward republican states and first-past-the-post), it\u0026rsquo;s not nearly enough and it pales to the aggressive, Never play defense, approaches employed by the American right.\nThere are systemic reasons underlying the difficulty the American left has with regard to passing policy but I view those as explanations and the party tends to present them as excuses. Just fix it. X isn\u0026rsquo;t your fault but Y is your responsibility.\nBuilding isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, or we\u0026rsquo;d already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We\u0026rsquo;re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building.\nEvery step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you\u0026rsquo;re doing isn\u0026rsquo;t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we\u0026rsquo;ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems — we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems.\nI expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here\u0026rsquo;s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There\u0026rsquo;s an excellent chance I\u0026rsquo;ll agree with you.\nOur nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that\u0026rsquo;s to build.\nGood conversations about progress are ones in which people both critique existing ideas and contribute new ideas. People will \u0026ndash; or at least I tend to \u0026ndash; leave conversations in which criticism dominates. Think of brainstorming, etc, and \u0026ldquo;there are no bad ideas\u0026rdquo;. Creativity is a product of volume or, in this context, good ideas are the result of picking through lots of bad ideas.\nThe first step in problem solving is to Understand and agree about the problem. This essay puts forward a good, albeit vague and almost-too-encompasing, definition of one of our problems: America isn\u0026rsquo;t building enough and we\u0026rsquo;re suffering because of it. The next steps are identifying why we aren\u0026rsquo;t building, what we need to build, how we can build it, and generally constructing a Theory of change for the future in which we can and do build.\nAs for specifics, insofar as a direction is specific, I agree with Ezra Klein\u0026rsquo;s response:\nA sustained and concerted movement that cares about institutional reform. But people get much more excited about building something, anything, than about reforming existing institutions. [Meta]-building isn\u0026rsquo;t a popular pastime, and the patient, focused work it requires is particularly frustrating, in my experience, to entrepreneurial personalities.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:kleinWhyWeCanBuild2020)\nBibliography References Andreessen, Marc. 2020. “It’s Time to Build.” Andreessen Horowitz. https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/.

Conservatives certainly fought, there is no denying that. They fought with every bit of obstruction and scandal their operatives could muster. But this was not a culture war. Rather, America\u0026rsquo;s conservatives fought a political war over culture. Republicans used cultural issues to gain—or to try to gain—political power. Their brightest minds and greatest efforts went into securing control of judiciary, developing a judicial philosophy for their appointees, securing control of the Capitol, and developing laws that could be implemented in multiple state houses across the nation. No actual attempt to change the culture was attempted.\n[emphasis mine]\nThis seems a bizarre take from my perspective. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the nuance between waging a culture war and fighting a political war over culture. Doubly bizarre is the claim the \u0026ldquo;No actual attempt to change the culture was attempted\u0026rdquo;. Yes \u0026ndash; yes there has been. Or is there a pedantry at play with regard to terms such that pushing legislative, judicial, media, and narrative (cultural!) policies are themselves not attempts to change culture?\nCulture wars are long wars. Instilling new ideas and overthrowing existing orthodoxies takes time—usually two to three generations of time. It is a 35-50 year process.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe logic of cohort change can be grasped by the graphic at the top of this essay (Putnam includes many similar ones in his book). America\u0026rsquo;s future is godless not because the God-fearing were convinced of the errors of their faith, but because their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren never adopted their faith to start out with. Cultures do not change when people replace old ideas with new ones; cultures change when people with new ideas replace the people with old ones.\nIf you want to see this process in real time, look no further than the Democrat\u0026rsquo;s socialist wing. Older party leaders view the socialists as spoilers and madmen, political contagions not to be fought against nor partnered with, but contained and quarantined. Socialism is not something they take seriously. This is a cohort problem. Democrats under 40 take socialism very seriously. The Great Recession was their formative event; the old orthodoxy did not seem equal to the fear and heartache it caused. Thus, gradually, the younger cohorts have been won over to the socialist cause. All that keeps the socialists at bay is the power of their elders. That power cannot last. At some point in the next decade the transition point will arrive. Gradually will become suddenly, and America\u0026rsquo;s most popular party will be openly run by socialists.\nUnderstanding this is equal parts clarifying and frustrating. Clarifying, because it gives us a clear idea of what must be done and of what cannot be done. Frustration comes from that second item: as culture wars are long wars, there are no quick victories. If you reject the quickly crystalizing orthodoxy of America\u0026rsquo;s millennials, your short-term options are limited. The millennials are a lost generation; they will persist in their errors to the end of their days. Theirs is a doomed cohort—and for most of the next two decades, this doomed cohort will be in charge.\nI suppose I\u0026rsquo;m a member of the cohort discussed here and don\u0026rsquo;t see eye-to-eye with the author\u0026rsquo;s use of \u0026ldquo;doomed\u0026rdquo; or the general maligning of socialism.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:greerCultureWarsAreLongWars2021 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/cec64d96-d0ea-4073-a74d-efb5a0588d93/","summary":"Tanner Greer, (NO_ITEM_DATA:greerCultureWarsAreLongWars2021)\nSummary See Cultural change; slow, then fast.\nThoughts A right-leaning think-piece regarding culture wars with a good nugget regarding the pace at which cultural change occurs.

One the clearest presentations of his ideas is in his 2016 book The Secret of Our Success. The book is less a heavy scholarly tome than a poppified version of Henrich\u0026rsquo;s research, but Henrich\u0026rsquo;s decision to trade theoretical detail for accessibility is understandable (it is also why I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad quoting large blocks of text from the book in this post). Henrich advances the argument that brain-power alone is not enough to explain why humans are such a successful species. Humans, he argues, are not nearly as intelligent as we think they are. Remove them from the culture and environment they have learned to operate in and they fail quickly. His favorite example of this are European explorers who die in the middle of deserts, jungles, or arctic wastes even though thousands of generations of hunter-gatherers were able to survive and thrive in these same environments. If human success was due to our ability to problem solve, analyze, and rationally develop novel solutions to novel challenges, the explorers should have been fine. Their ghastly fates suggest that rationality may not be the key to human survival.\nHenrich makes two arguments here, both relevant to contemporary debates in politics and philosophy. The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions stick around longest when they are adaptive. This process is \u0026ldquo;blind.\u0026rdquo; Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases (like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually reduce the efficacy of the tradition [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y]. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot) understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to artificially create replacements [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence].\nI do not think Henrich is willing to extend these points to all elements of human culture. If we are to take analogies with genetic evolution seriously, then we should not be surprised if a large amount of our cultural baggage are just random accretions passed on from one generation to the next—in essence, the cultural version of genetic drift. But that is the trouble: we have no way to tell which traditions are adaptive and which are merely drift.\nAll of this meshes splendidly with the work of James C Scott.[5] (If you have never read anything by him before, I recommend starting with this essay). Scott has spent a large amount of his career studying the way states shape the societies they rule over, and the way societies try to resist the advance of the state. The central problem of ruler-ship, as Scott sees it, is what he calls legibility. To extract resources from a population the state must be able to understand that population. The state needs to make the people and things it rules legible to agents of the government. Legibility means uniformity. States dream up uniform weights and measures, impress national languages and ID numbers on their people, and divvy the country up into land plots and administrative districts, all to make the realm legible to the powers that be. The problem is that not all important things can be made legible. Much of what makes a society successful is knowledge of the tacit sort: rarely articulated, messy, and from the outside looking in, purposeless. These are the first things lost in the quest for legibility. Traditions, small cultural differences, odd and distinctive lifeways—in other words, the products of cultural evolution that Henrich fills his book with—are all swept aside by a rationalizing state that preserves (or in many cases, imposes) only what it can be understood and manipulated from the 2,000 foot view. The result, as Scott chronicles with example after example, are many of the greatest catastrophes of human history.\nNone of Scott\u0026rsquo;s works are in Henrich\u0026rsquo;s bibliography, but it is hard to imagine Henrich being surprised by this outcome. The social engineer is attempting to replace hundreds of traditions, norms, and nuggets of local knowledge through rational calculation. He is the functional equivalent of the European explorer starving in lands of plenty. The only difference between the rationalist explorer and the rationalist social engineer is that the engineer has the power to force the land to starve with him.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:henrichSecretOurSuccessHowCultureDrivingHumanEvolutionDomesticatingOur2016 NO_ITEM_DATA:scottSeeingStateHowCertainSchemesImproveHumanConditionHaveFailed2020 NO_ITEM_DATA:greerTraditionSmarterYouAre2018 Backlinks Scott Alexander | Book Review: The Secret Of Our Success ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/35669b5b-bf75-4bda-9037-42a2d3af956d/","summary":"Tanner Greer , (NO_ITEM_DATA:greerTraditionSmarterYouAre2018)\nSummary On (NO_ITEM_DATA:scottSeeingStateHowCertainSchemesImproveHumanConditionHaveFailed2020) and (NO_ITEM_DATA:henrichSecretOurSuccessHowCultureDrivingHumanEvolutionDomesticatingOur2016).\nThoughts I prefer the individual reviews of Scott Alexander | Book Review: Seeing Like A State and Scott Alexander | Book Review: The Secret Of Our Success.\nNotes Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about Henrich first.

That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or you don\u0026rsquo;t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people believe something after it had been proven to them.\nAnd I nodded my head, because it sounded reasonable enough, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until a few hours later that I thought about it again and went \u0026ldquo;Wait, no, that would be a terrible idea.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhen I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky\u0026rsquo;s Ages in Chaos is a good example of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct, so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals.\nAnd then I read the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct, so devastating, that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe I had ever been so dumb as to believe Velikovsky.\nAnd then I read the rebuttals to the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct that I felt silly for ever doubting.\nAnd so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable. [\u0026hellip;]\nGiven a total lack of independent intellectual steering power and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled crackpots who write books about Venus being a comet.\nYou could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness [Learned helplessness], where I know any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don\u0026rsquo;t even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even the slightest possibility that you might be right.\n(This is the correct Bayesian action: if I know that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way. I should ignore it and stick with my prior.)\nI consider myself lucky in that my epistemic learned helplessness is circumscribed; there are still cases where I\u0026rsquo;ll trust the evidence of my own reason. In fact, I trust it in most cases other than infamously deceptive arguments in fields I know little about. But I think the average uneducated person doesn\u0026rsquo;t and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Anyone anywhere – politicians, scammy businessmen, smooth-talking romantic partners – would be able to argue them into anything. And so they take the obvious and correct defensive maneuver – they will never let anyone convince them of any belief that sounds \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo;.\n(and remember that, if you grow up in the right circles, beliefs along the lines of \u0026ldquo;astrology doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo; sound \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo;.)\nResponsible doctors are at the other end of the spectrum from terrorists here. I once heard someone rail against how doctors totally ignored all the latest and most exciting medical studies. The same person, practically in the same breath, then railed against how 50% to 90% of medical studies are wrong. These two observations are not unrelated. Not only are there so many terrible studies, but pseudomedicine (not the stupid homeopathy type, but the type that links everything to some obscure chemical on an out-of-the-way metabolic pathway) has, for me, proven much like pseudohistory – unless I am an expert in that particular subsubfield of medicine, it can sound very convincing even when it\u0026rsquo;s very wrong.\nBibliography References Alexander, Scott. 2019. “Epistemic Learned Helplessness.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/.

The Secret Of Our Success by anthropologist Joseph Henrich manages to be an amazing book anyway.\nHenrich wants to debunk (or at least clarify) a popular view where humans succeeded because of our raw intelligence. In this view, we are smart enough to invent neat tools that help us survive and adapt to unfamiliar environments.\nAgainst such theories: we cannot actually do this. Henrich walks the reader through many stories about European explorers marooned in unfamiliar environments. These explorers usually starved to death. They starved to death in the middle of endless plenty. Some of them were in Arctic lands that the Inuit considered among their richest hunting grounds. Others were in jungles, surrounded by edible plants and animals. One particularly unfortunate group was in Alabama, and would have perished entirely if they hadn\u0026rsquo;t been captured and enslaved by local Indians first.\nThese explorers had many advantages over our hominid ancestors. For one thing, their exploration parties were made up entirely of strong young men in their prime, with no need to support women, children, or the elderly. They were often selected for their education and intelligence. Many of them were from Victorian Britain, one of the most successful civilizations in history, full of geniuses like Darwin and Galton. Most of them had some past experience with wilderness craft and survival. But despite their big brains, when faced with the task our big brains supposedly evolved for – figuring out how to do hunting and gathering in a wilderness environment – they failed pathetically.\nNor is it surprising that they failed. Hunting and gathering is actually really hard. Here\u0026rsquo;s Henrich\u0026rsquo;s description of how the Inuit hunt seals:\nYou first have to find their breathing holes in the ice. It\u0026rsquo;s important that the area around the hole be snow-covered—otherwise the seals will hear you and vanish. You then open the hole, smell it to verify it\u0026rsquo;s still in use (what do seals smell like?), and then assess the shape of the hole using a special curved piece of caribou antler. The hole is then covered with snow, save for a small gap at the top that is capped with a down indicator. If the seal enters the hole, the indicator moves, and you must blindly plunge your harpoon into the hole using all your weight. Your harpoon should be about 1.5 meters (5ft) long, with a detachable tip that is tethered with a heavy braid of sinew line. You can get the antler from the previously noted caribou, which you brought down with your driftwood bow.\nThe rear spike of the harpoon is made of extra-hard polar bear bone (yes, you also need to know how to kill polar bears; best to catch them napping in their dens). Once you\u0026rsquo;ve plunged your harpoon\u0026rsquo;s head into the seal, you\u0026rsquo;re then in a wrestling match as you reel him in, onto the ice, where you can finish him off with the aforementioned bear-bone spike.\nNow you have a seal, but you have to cook it. However, there are no trees at this latitude for wood, and driftwood is too sparse and valuable to use routinely for fires. To have a reliable fire, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to carve a lamp from soapstone (you know what soapstone looks like, right?), render some oil for the lamp from blubber, and make a wick out of a particular species of moss. You will also need water. The pack ice is frozen salt water, so using it for drinking will just make you dehydrate faster. However, old sea ice has lost most of its salt, so it can be melted to make potable water. Of course, you need to be able to locate and identify old sea ice by color and texture. To melt it, make sure you have enough oil for your soapstone lamp.\nNo surprise that stranded explorers couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure all this out. It\u0026rsquo;s more surprising that the Inuit did. And although the Arctic is an unusually hostile place for humans, Henrich makes it clear that hunting-gathering techniques of this level of complexity are standard everywhere. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the Indians of Tierra del Fuego make arrows:\nAmong the Fuegians, making an arrow requires a 14-step procedure that involves using seven different tools to work six different materials. Here are some of the steps:\n– The process begins by selecting the wood for the shaft, which preferably comes from chaura, a bushy, evergreen shrub. Though strong and light, this wood is a non-intuitive choice since the gnarled branches require extensive straightening (why not start with straighter branches?).\n– The wood is heated, straightened with the craftsman\u0026rsquo;s teeth, and eventually finished with a scraper. Then, using a pre-heated and grooved stone, the shaft is pressed into the grooves and rubbed back and forth, pressing it down with a piece of fox skin. The fox skin becomes impregnated with the dust, which prepares it for the polishing stage (Does it have to be fox skin?).\n– Bits of pitch, gathered from the beach, are chewed and mixed with ash (What if you don\u0026rsquo;t include the ash?).\n– The mixture is then applied to both ends of a heated shaft, which must then be coated with white clay (what about red clay? Do you have to heat it?). This prepares the ends for the fletching and arrowhead.\n– Two feathers are used for the fletching, preferably from upland geese (why not chicken feathers?).\n– Right-handed bowman must use feathers from the left wing of the bird, and vice versa for lefties (Does this really matter?).\n– The feathers are lashed to the shaft using sinews from the back of the guanaco, after they are smoothed and thinned with water and saliva (why not sinews from the fox that I had to kill for the aforementioned skin?).\nNext is the arrowhead, which must be crafted and then attached to the shaft, and of course there is also the bow, quiver and archery skills. But, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it there, since I think you get the idea.\nHow do hunter-gatherers know how to do all this? We usually summarize it as \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo;. How did it form? Not through some smart Inuit or Fuegian person reasoning it out; if that had been it, smart European explorers should have been able to reason it out too.\nThe obvious answer is \u0026ldquo;cultural evolution\u0026rdquo; [Cultural evolution], but Henrich isn\u0026rsquo;t much better than anyone else at taking the mystery out of this phrase. Trial and error must have been involved, and less successful groups/people imitating the techniques of more successful ones. But is that really a satisfying explanation?\nI found the chapter on language a helpful reminder that we already basically accept something like this is true. How did language get invented? I\u0026rsquo;m especially interested in this question because of my brief interactions with conlanging communities – people who try to construct their own languages as a hobby or as part of a fantasy universe, like Tolkien did with Elvish. Most people are terrible at this; their languages are either unusable, or exact clones of English. Only people who (like Tolkien) already have years of formal training in linguistics can do a remotely passable job. And you\u0026rsquo;re telling me the original languages were invented by cavemen? Surely there was no committee of Proto-Indo-European nomads that voted on whether to have an inflecting or agglutinating tongue? Surely nobody ran out of their cave shouting \u0026ldquo;Eureka!\u0026rdquo; after having discovered the interjection? We just kind of accept that after cavemen working really hard to communicate with each other, eventually language – still one of the most complicated and impressive productions of the human race – just sort of happened.\nTaking the generation of culture as secondary to this kind of mysterious process, Henrich turns to its transmission. If cultural generation happens at a certain rate, then the fidelity of transmission determines whether a given society advances, stagnates, or declines.\nFor Henrich, humans started becoming more than just another species of monkey when we started transmitting culture with high fidelity. Some anthropologists talk about the Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis (a) \u0026ndash; the theory that humans evolved big brains in order to succeed at social maneuvering and climbing dominance hierarchies. Henrich counters with his own Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis \u0026ndash; humans evolved big brains in order to be able to maintain things like Inuit seal hunting techniques. Everything that separates us from the apes is part of an evolutionary package designed to help us maintain this kind of culture, exploit this kind of culture, or adjust to the new abilities that this kind of culture gave us.\nII Secret gives many examples of many culture-related adaptations, and not all are in the brain.\nOur digestive tracts evolved alongside our cultures. Specifically, they evolved to be unusually puny:\nOur mouths are the size of the squirrel monkey\u0026rsquo;s, a species that weighs less than three pounds. Chimpanzees can open their mouths twice as wide as we can and hold substantial amounts of food compressed between their lips and large teeth. We also have puny jaw muscles that reach up only to just below our ears. Other primates\u0026rsquo; jaw muscles stretch to the top of their heads, where they sometimes even latch onto a central bony ridge. Our stomachs are small, having only a third of the surface area that we\u0026rsquo;d expect for a primate of our size, and our colons are too short, being only 60% of their expected mass.\nCompared to other animals, we have such atrophied digestive tracts that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to live. What saves us? All of our food processing techniques, especially cooking, but also chopping, rinsing, boiling, and soaking. We\u0026rsquo;ve done much of the work of digestion before food even enters our mouths. Our culture teaches us how to do this, both in broad terms like \u0026ldquo;hold things over fire to cook them\u0026rdquo; and in specific terms like \u0026ldquo;this plant needs to be soaked in water for 24 hours to leach out the toxins\u0026rdquo;. Each culture has its own cooking knowledge related to the local plants and animals; a frequent cause of death among European explorers was cooking things in ways that didn\u0026rsquo;t unlock any of the nutrients, and so starving while apparently well-fed.\nFire is an especially important food processing innovation, and it is entirely culturally transmitted. Henrich is kind of cruel in his insistence on this. He recommends readers go outside and try to start a fire. He even gives some helpful hints \u0026ndash; flint is involved, rubbing two sticks together works for some people, etc. He predicts \u0026ndash; and stories I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from unfortunate campers confirm \u0026ndash; that you will not be able to do this, despite an IQ far beyond that of most of our hominid ancestors. In fact, some groups (most notably the aboriginal Tasmanians) seem to have lost the ability to make fire, and never rediscovered it. Fire-making was discovered a small number of times, maybe once, and has been culturally transmitted since then.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not just about chopping things up or roasting them. Traditional food processing techniques can get arbitrarily complicated. Nixtamalization of corn, necessary to prevent vitamin deficiencies, involves soaking the corn in a solution containing ground-up burnt seashells. The ancient Mexicans discovered this and lived off corn just fine for millennia. When the conquistadors took over, they ignored it and ate corn straight. For four hundred years, Europeans and Americans ate unnixtamalized corn. By official statistics, three million Americans came down with corn-related vitamin deficiencies during this time, and up to a hundred thousand died. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until 1937 that Western scientists discovered which vitamins were involved and developed an industrial version of nixtamalization that made corn safe. Early 1900s Americans were very smart and had lots of advantages over ancient Mexicans. But the ancient Mexicans\u0026rsquo; culture got this one right in a way it took Westerners centuries to match.\nOur hands and limbs also evolved alongside our cultures. We improved dramatically in some areas: after eons of tool use, our hands outclass those of any other ape in terms of finesse. In other cases, we devolved systems that were no longer necessary; we are much weaker than any other ape. Henrich describes a circus act of the 1940s where the ringmaster would challenge strong men in the audience to wrestle a juvenile chimpanzee. The chimpanzee was tied up, dressed in a mask that prevented it from biting, and wearing soft gloves that prevented it from scratching. No human ever lasted more than five seconds. Our common ancestor with other apes grew weaker and weaker as we became more and more reliant on artificial weapons to give us an advantage.\nEven our sweat glands evolved alongside culture. Humans are persistence hunters: they cannot run as fast as gazelles, but they can keep running for longer than gazelles (or almost anything else). Why did we evolve into that niche? The secret is our ability to carry water. Every hunter-gatherer culture has invented its own water-carrying techniques, usually some kind of waterskin. This allowed humans to switch to perspiration-based cooling systems, which allowed them to run as long as they want.\nIII But most of our differences from other apes are indeed in the brain. They\u0026rsquo;re just not where you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nTomasello et al tested human toddlers vs. apes on a series of traditional IQ type questions. The match-up was surprisingly fair; in areas like memory, logic, and spatial reasoning, the three species did about the same. But in ability to learn from another person, humans wiped the floor with the other two ape species:\nRemember, Henrich thinks culture accumulates through random mutation. Humans don\u0026rsquo;t have control over how culture gets generated. They have more control over how much of it gets transmitted to the next generation. If 100% gets transmitted, then as more and more mutations accumulate, the culture becomes better and better. If less than 100% gets transmitted, then at some point new culture gained and old culture lost fall into equilibrium, and your society stabilizes at some higher or lower technological level. This means that transmitting culture to the next generation is maybe the core human skill. The human brain is optimized to make this work as well as possible.\nHuman children are obsessed with learning things. And they don\u0026rsquo;t learn things randomly. There seem to be \u0026ldquo;biases in cultural learning\u0026rdquo;, ie slots in an infant\u0026rsquo;s mind that they know need to be filled with knowledge, and which they preferentially seek out the knowledge necessary to fill.\nOne slot is for language. Human children naturally listen to speech (as early as in the womb). They naturally prune the phonemes they are able to produce and distinguish to the ones in the local language. And they naturally figure out how to speak and understand what people are saying, even though learning a language is hard even for smart adults.\nAnother slot is for animals. In a world where megafauna has been relegated to zoos, we still teach children their ABCs with \u0026ldquo;L is for lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;B is for bear\u0026rdquo;, and children still read picture books about Mr. Frog and Mrs. Snake holding tea parties. Henrich suggests that just as the young brain is hard-coded to want to learn language, so it is hard-coded to want to learn the local animal life (maybe little boys\u0026rsquo; vehicle obsession is an outgrowth of this – buses and trains are the closest thing to local megafauna that most of them will encounter!)\nAnother slot is for plants:\nTo see this system in operation, let\u0026rsquo;s consider how infants respond to unfamiliar plants. Plants are loaded with prickly thorns, noxious oils, stinging nettles and dangerous toxins, all genetically evolved to prevent animals like us from messing with them. Given our species wide geographic range and diverse use of plants as foods, medicines and construction materials, we ought to be primed to both learn about plants and avoid their dangers. To explore this idea in the lab, the psychologists Annie Wertz and Karen Wynn first gave infants, who ranged in age from eight to eighteen months, an opportunity to touch novel plants (basil and parsley) and artifacts, including both novel objects and common ones, like wooden spoons and small lamps.\nThe results were striking. Regardless of age, many infants flatly refused to touch the plants at all. When they did touch them, they waited substantially longer than they did with the artifacts. By contrast, even with the novel objects, infants showed none of this reluctance. This suggests that well before one year of age infants can readily distinguish plants from other things, and are primed for caution with plants. But, how do they get past this conservative predisposition?\nThe answer is that infants keenly watch what other people do with plants, and are only inclined to touch or eat the plants that other people have touched or eaten. In fact, once they get the \u0026lsquo;go ahead\u0026rsquo; via cultural learning, they are suddenly interested in eating plants. To explore this, Annie and Karen exposed infants to models who both picked fruit from plants and also picked fruit-like things from an artifact of similar size and shape to the plant. The models put both the fruit and the fruit-like things in their mouths. Next, the infants were given a choice to go for the fruit (picked from the plant) or the fruit-like things picked from the object. Over 75% of the time the infants went for the fruit, not the fruit-like things, since they\u0026rsquo;d gotten the \u0026lsquo;go ahead\u0026rsquo; via cultural learning.\nAs a check, the infants were also exposed to models putting the fruit or fruit-like things behind their ears(not in their mouths). In this case, the infants went for the fruit or fruit-like things in equal measure. It seems that plants are most interesting if you can eat them, but only if you have some cultural learning cues that they aren\u0026rsquo;t toxic.\nAfter Annie first told me about her work while I was visiting Yale in 2013, I went home to test it on my 6-month-old son, Josh. Josh seemed very likely to overturn Annie\u0026rsquo;s hard empirical work, since he immediately grasped anything you gave him and put it rapidly in his mouth. Comfortable in his mom\u0026rsquo;s arms, I first offered Josh a novel plastic cube. He delighted in grabbing it and shoving it directly into his mouth, without any hesitation. Then, I offered him a sprig of arugula. He quickly grabbed it, but then paused, looked with curious uncertainty at it, and then slowly let it fall from his hand while turning to hug his mom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out how rich the psychology is here. Not only do infants have to recognize that plants are different from objects of similar size, shape and color, but they need to create categories for types of plants, like basil and parsley, and distinguish \u0026rsquo;eating\u0026rsquo; from just \u0026rsquo;touching\u0026rsquo;. It does them little good to code their observation of someone eating basil as \u0026lsquo;plants are good to eat\u0026rsquo; since that might cause them to eat poisonous plants as well as basil. But, it also does them little good to narrowly code the observation as \u0026rsquo;that particular sprig of basil is good to eat\u0026rsquo; since that particular sprig has just been eaten by the person they are watching. This another content bias in cultural learning.\nThis ties into the more general phenomenon of figuring out what\u0026rsquo;s edible. Most Westerners learn insects aren\u0026rsquo;t edible; some Asians learn that they are. This feels deeper than just someone telling you insects aren\u0026rsquo;t edible and you believing them. When I was in Thailand, my guide offered me a giant cricket, telling me it was delicious. I believed him when he said it was safe to eat, I even believed him when he said it tasted good to him, but my conditioning won out – I didn\u0026rsquo;t eat the cricket. There seems to be some process where a child\u0026rsquo;s brain learns what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t locally edible, then hard-codes it against future change.\n(Or so they say; I\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to eat shrimp either.)\nAnother slot is for gender roles. By now we\u0026rsquo;ve all heard the stories of progressives who try to raise their children without any exposure to gender. Their failure has sometimes been taken as evidence that gender is hard-coded. But it can\u0026rsquo;t be quite that simple: some modern gender roles, like girls = pink, are far from obvious or universal. Instead, it looks like children have a hard-coded slot that gender roles go into, work hard to figure out what the local gender roles are (even if their parents are trying to confuse them), then latch onto them and don\u0026rsquo;t let go.\nIn the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis, humans live in obligate symbiosis with a culture. A brain without an associated culture is incomplete and not very useful. So the infant brain is adapted to seek out the important aspects of its local culture almost from birth and fill them into the appropriate slots in order to become whole.\nIV The next part of the book discusses post-childhood learning. This plays an important role in hunter-gatherer tribes:\nWhile hunters reach their peak strength and speed in their twenties, individual hunting success does not peak until around age 30, because success depends more on know-how and refined skills than on physical prowess.\nThis part of the book made most sense in the context of examples like the Inuit seal-hunting strategy which drove home just how complicated and difficult hunting-gathering was. Think less \u0026ldquo;Boy Scouts\u0026rdquo; and more \u0026ldquo;PhD\u0026rdquo;; a primitive tribesperson\u0026rsquo;s life requires mastery of various complicated technologies and skills. And the difference between \u0026ldquo;mediocre hunter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;great hunter\u0026rdquo; can be the difference between high status (and good mating opportunities) and low status, or even between life and death. Hunter-gatherers really want to learn the essentials of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and learning it is really hard. Their heuristics are:\nLearn from people who are good at things and/or widely-respected\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t already read about the difference between dominance and prestige hierarchies, check out Kevin Simler\u0026rsquo;s blog post (a) [Kevin Simler | Social Status: Down the Rabbit Hole] on the topic. People will fear and obey authority figures like kings and chieftains, but they give a different kind of respect (\u0026ldquo;prestige\u0026rdquo;) to people who seem good at things. And since it\u0026rsquo;s hard to figure out who\u0026rsquo;s good at things (can a non-musician who wants to start learning music tell the difference between a merely good performer and one of the world\u0026rsquo;s best?) most people use the heuristic of respecting the people who other people respect. Once you identify someone as respect-worthy, you strongly consider copying them in, well, everything\nOf course, this creates the risk of prestige cascades, where some irrelevant factor (Henrich mentions being a reality show star) catapults someone to fame, everyone talks about them, and you end up with Muggeridge\u0026rsquo;s definition of a celebrity: someone famous for being famous.\nSome of this makes more sense if you go back to the evolutionary roots, and imagine watching the best hunter in your tribe to see what his secret is, or being nice to him in the hopes that he\u0026rsquo;ll take you under his wing and teach you stuff.\n(but if all this is true, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t public awareness campaigns that hire celebrity spokespeople be wild successes? Don\u0026rsquo;t they just as often fail, regardless of how famous a basketball player they can convince to lecture schoolchildren about how Winners Don\u0026rsquo;t Do Drugs?)\nLearn from people who are like you\nIf you are a man, it is probably a bad idea to learn fashion by observing women. If you are a servant, it is probably a bad idea to learn the rules of etiquette by observing how the king behaves. People are naturally inclined to learn from people more similar to themselves.\nLearn from old people\nHumans are almost unique in having menopause; most animals keep reproducing until they die in late middle-age. Why does evolution want humans to stick around without reproducing?\nBecause old people have already learned the local culture and can teach it to others. Henrich asks us to throw out any personal experience we have of elders; we live in a rapidly-changing world where an old person is probably \u0026ldquo;behind the times\u0026rdquo;. But for most of history, change happened glacially slowly, and old people would have spent their entire lives accumulating relevant knowledge. Imagine a Silicon Valley programmer stumped by a particularly tough bug in his code calling up his grandfather, who has seventy years\u0026rsquo; experience in the relevant programming language.\nSometimes important events only happen once in a generation. Henrich tells the story of an Australian aboriginal tribe facing a massive drought. Nobody knew what to do except Paralji, the tribe\u0026rsquo;s oldest man, who had lived through the last massive drought and remembered where his own elders had told him to find the last-resort waterholes.\n[formatting mine]\nV I was inspired to read Secret by Scholar\u0026rsquo;s Stage\u0026rsquo;s review (a) [Tanner Greer | Tradition Is Smarter Than You Are]. I hate to be unoriginal, but after reading the whole book, I agree that the three sections Tanner cites \u0026ndash; on divination, on manioc, and on shark taboos \u0026ndash; are by far the best and most fascinating.\nOn divination:\nWhen hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou.\nHowever, this situation is like [the Matching pennies game]. The caribou are mismatchers and the hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding those locations (where they have previously seen humans). Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing.\nCan cultural evolution compensate for our cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own decision-making biases.\nThis is not some obscure, isolated practice, and other cases of divination provide more evidence. In Indonesia, the Kantus of Kalimantan use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots. Geographer Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy, and lead them to expect floods to be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that location (which is not true). Second\u0026hellip;Kantus pay attention to others\u0026rsquo; success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. To reduce the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, Kantu rely on a system of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them avoid catastrophic crop failures. Divination results depend not only on seeing a particular bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call may be favorable, and another unfavorable).\nThe patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the 17th century when rice cultivation was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by randomizing garden locations. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On-average, over a lifetime, these farmers would do better \u0026ndash; be more successful \u0026ndash; than farmers who relied on the Gambler\u0026rsquo;s Fallacy or on copying others\u0026rsquo; immediate behavior. Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system spread throughout the agricultural populations of this Borneo region. Yet, it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions where it\u0026rsquo;s most adaptive.\nScott Aaronson has written about how easy it is to predict people trying to \u0026ldquo;be random\u0026rdquo;:\nIn a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a simple little program that would let people type either \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; and would predict which key they were going to push next. It\u0026rsquo;s actually very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about 70% of the time. Most people don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to type randomly. They\u0026rsquo;ll have too many alternations and so on. There will be all sorts of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of probabilistic model. Even a very crude one will do well. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even beat my own program, knowing exactly how it worked. I challenged people to try this and the program was getting between 70% and 80% prediction rates. Then, we found one student that the program predicted exactly 50% of the time. We asked him what his secret was and he responded that he \u0026ldquo;just used his free will.\u0026rdquo;\nBut being genuinely random is important in pursuing mixed game theoretic strategies. Henrich\u0026rsquo;s view is that divination solved this problem effectively.\nI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the Romans using augury to decide when and where to attack. This always struck me as crazy; generals are going to risk the lives of thousands of soldiers because they saw a weird bird earlier that morning? But war is a classic example of when a random strategy can be useful. If you\u0026rsquo;re deciding whether to attack the enemy\u0026rsquo;s right vs. left flank, it\u0026rsquo;s important that the enemy can\u0026rsquo;t predict your decision and send his best defenders there. If you\u0026rsquo;re generally predictable \u0026ndash; and Scott Aaronson says you are \u0026ndash; then outsourcing your decision to weird birds might be the best way to go.\nAnd then there\u0026rsquo;s manioc. This is a tuber native to the Americas. It contains cyanide, and if you eat too much of it, you get cyanide poisoning. From Henrich:\nIn the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing.\nSuch processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever, seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, stomach troubles, and vomiting).\nSo, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She\u0026rsquo;d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.\nThus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque\u0026mdash;an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.\nWait. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s actually rather easy to individually figure out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations. The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven\u0026rsquo;t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places, there\u0026rsquo;s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, but these techniques are spreading only slowly.\nRationalists always wonder: how come people aren\u0026rsquo;t more rational? How come you can prove a thousand times, using Facts and Logic, that something is stupid, and yet people will still keep doing it?\nHenrich hints at an answer: for basically all of history, using reason would get you killed.\nA reasonable person would have figured out there was no way for oracle-bones to accurately predict the future. They would have abandoned divination, failed at hunting, and maybe died of starvation.\nA reasonable person would have asked why everyone was wasting so much time preparing manioc. When told \u0026ldquo;Because that\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;ve always done it\u0026rdquo;, they would have been unsatisfied with that answer. They would have done some experiments, and found that a simpler process of boiling it worked just as well. They would have saved lots of time, maybe converted all their friends to the new and easier method. Twenty years later, they would have gotten sick and died, in a way so causally distant from their decision to change manioc processing methods that nobody would ever have been able to link the two together.\nHenrich discusses pregnancy taboos in Fiji; pregnant women are banned from eating sharks. Sure enough, these sharks contain chemicals that can cause birth defects. The women didn\u0026rsquo;t really know why they weren\u0026rsquo;t eating the sharks, but when anthropologists demanded a reason, they eventually decided it was because their babies would be born with shark skin rather than human skin. As explanations go, this leaves a lot to be desired. How come you can still eat other fish? Aren\u0026rsquo;t you worried your kids will have scales? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t the slightest familiarity with biology prove this mechanism is garbage? But if some smart independent-minded iconoclastic Fijian girl figured any of this out, she would break the taboo and her child would have birth defects.\nIn giving humans reason at all, evolution took a huge risk. Surely it must have wished there was some other way, some path that made us big-brained enough to understand tradition, but not big-brained enough to question it. Maybe it searched for a mind design like that and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find one. So it was left with this ticking time-bomb, this ape that was constantly going to be able to convince itself of hare-brained and probably-fatal ideas.\nHere, too, culture came to the rescue. One of the most important parts of any culture \u0026ndash; more important than the techniques for hunting seals, more important than the techniques for processing tubers \u0026ndash; is techniques for making sure nobody ever questions tradition. Like the belief that anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t conform is probably a witch who should be cast out lest they bring destruction upon everybody. Or the belief in a God who has commanded certain specific weird dietary restrictions, and will torture you forever if you disagree. Or the fairy tales where the prince asks a wizard for help, and the wizard says \u0026ldquo;You may have everything you wish forever, but you must never nod your head at a badger\u0026rdquo;, and then one day the prince nods his head at a badger, and his whole empire collapses into dust, and the moral of the story is that you should always obey weird advice you don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a monster at the end of this book. Humans evolved to transmit culture with high fidelity. And one of the biggest threats to transmitting culture with high fidelity was Reason. Our ancestors lived in Epistemic Hell [I\u0026rsquo;d say we currently live in Less-Hell as opposed to No-Hell], where they had to constantly rely on causally opaque processes with justifications that couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be true, and if they ever questioned them then they might die. Historically, Reason has been the villain of the human narrative, a corrosive force that tempts people away from adaptive behavior towards choices that \u0026ldquo;sounded good at the time\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy are people so bad at reasoning? For the same reason they\u0026rsquo;re so bad at letting poisonous spiders walk all over their face without freaking out. Both \u0026ldquo;skills\u0026rdquo; are really bad ideas, most of the people who tried them died in the process, so evolution removed those genes from the population, and successful cultures stigmatized them enough to give people an internalized fear of even trying.\nVI This book belongs alongside Seeing Like A State [James C. Scott | Seeing like a State] and the works of G.K. Chesterton [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence] as attempts to justify tradition, and to argue for organically-evolved institutions over top-down planning. What unique contribution does it make to this canon?\nFirst, a lot more specifically anthropological / paleoanthropological rigor than the other two.\nSecond, a much crisper focus: Chesterton had only the fuzziest idea that he was writing about cultural evolution, and Scott was only a little clearer. I think Henrich is the only one of the three to use the term, and once you hear it, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously the right framing.\nThird, a sense of how traditions contain the meta-tradition of defending themselves against Reason, and a sense for why this is necessary.\nAnd fourth, maybe we\u0026rsquo;re not at the point where we really want unique contributions yet. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re still at the point where we have to have this hammered in by more and more examples. The temptation is always to say \u0026ldquo;Ah, yes, a few simple things like taboos against eating poisonous plants may be relics of cultural evolution, but obviously by now we\u0026rsquo;re at the point where we know which traditions are important vs. random looniness, and we can rationally stick to the important ones while throwing out the garbage.\u0026rdquo; And then somebody points out to you that actually divination using oracle bones was one of the important traditions, and if you thought you knew better than that and tried to throw it out, your civilization would falter.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:henrichSecretOurSuccessHowCultureDrivingHumanEvolutionDomesticatingOur2016 NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewSecretOurSuccess2019 Backlinks Tanner Greer | Tradition Is Smarter Than You Are Joseph Patrick Henrich | The Secret of Our Success ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/cb2c8f33-41ee-457c-805a-27ccec7ba2c3/","summary":"Scott Alexander, (NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewSecretOurSuccess2019)\nSummary A book review and summary of the key points in (NO_ITEM_DATA:henrichSecretOurSuccessHowCultureDrivingHumanEvolutionDomesticatingOur2016).\nThoughts See Joseph Patrick Henrich | The Secret of Our Success.\nNotes I \u0026ldquo;Culture is the secret of humanity\u0026rsquo;s success\u0026rdquo; sounds like the most vapid possible thesis.

Or because X is only effective if the true reason isn\u0026rsquo;t said out loud (Taboo games) In fact, people might not know the real reason (The card says moops).\nThat said, it\u0026rsquo;s also not correct, in my strong opinion, to say \u0026ldquo;People who do X say it\u0026rsquo;s about Y when it\u0026rsquo;s really about Z, so their actual only reason for doing it is Z\u0026rdquo;.

Scott | Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.\nNotes I Scott starts with the story of \u0026ldquo;scientific forestry\u0026rdquo; in 18th century Prussia. Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, like a chump. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.\nThis went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn\u0026rsquo;t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and \u0026ldquo;scientific forestry\u0026rdquo; spread across Europe and the world.\nAnd this pattern repeats with suspicious regularity across history, not just in biological systems but also in social ones.\nNatural organically-evolved cities tend to be densely-packed mixtures of dark alleys, tiny shops, and overcrowded streets. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of identical giant Brutalist apartment buildings separated by wide boulevards, with everything separated into carefully-zoned districts. Yet for some reason, whenever these new rational cities were built, people hated them and did everything they could to move out into more organic suburbs. And again, for some reason the urban planners got promoted, became famous, and spread their destructive techniques around the world.\nYe olde organically-evolved peasant villages tended to be complicated confusions of everybody trying to raise fifty different crops at the same time on awkwardly shaped cramped parcels of land. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: giant collective mechanized farms growing purpose-bred high-yield crops and arranged in (say it with me) evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these giant collective farms had lower yields per acre than the old traditional methods, and wherever they arose famine and mass starvation followed. And again, for some reason governments continued to push the more \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; methods, whether it was socialist collectives in the USSR, big agricultural corporations in the US, or sprawling banana plantations in the Third World.\nTraditional lifestyles of many East African natives were nomadic, involving slash-and-burn agriculture in complicated jungle terrain according to a bewildering variety of ad-hoc rules. Modern scientific rationalists in African governments (both colonial and independent) came up with a better idea – resettlement of the natives into villages, where they could have modern amenities like schools, wells, electricity, and evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these villages kept failing: their crops died, their economies collapsed, and their native inhabitants disappeared back into the jungle. And again, for some reason the African governments kept trying to bring the natives back and make them stay, even if they had to blur the lines between villages and concentration camps to make it work.\nWhy did all of these schemes fail? And more importantly, why were they celebrated, rewarded, and continued, even when the fact of their failure became too obvious to ignore? Scott gives a two part answer.\nThe first part of the story is High Modernism [High modernism], an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific philosophy. The High Modernists claimed to be about figuring out the most efficient and high-tech way of doing things, but most of them knew little relevant math or science and were basically just LARPing being rational by placing things in evenly-spaced rectangular grids.\nBut the High Modernists were pawns in service of a deeper motive: the centralized state wanted the world to be \u0026ldquo;legible\u0026rdquo; [Legible], ie arranged in a way that made it easy to monitor and control. An intact forest might be more productive than an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of Norway spruce, but it was harder to legislate rules for, or assess taxes on.\nThe state promoted the High Modernists\u0026rsquo; platitudes about The Greater Good as cover [X isn\u0026rsquo;t (only) about Y], in order to implement the totalitarian schemes they wanted to implement anyway. The resulting experiments were usually failures by the humanitarian goals of the Modernists, but resounding successes by the command-and-control goals of the state. And so we gradually transitioned from systems that were messy but full of fine-tuned hidden order, to ones that were barely-functional but really easy to tax.\nII Examples and quotes from (NO_ITEM_DATA:scottSeeingStateHowCertainSchemesImproveHumanConditionHaveFailed2020) illustrating the difficulty of ruling/administering a population which lacks certain shared standards (e.g. weights, measures, definitions of what is \u0026ldquo;taxable land\u0026rdquo;).\nIII The moral of the story is: premodern states had very limited ability to tax their citizens effectively. Along with the problems mentioned above – nonstandardized measurement, nonstandardized property rights, nonstandardized personal names – we can add a few others. At this point national languages were a cruel fiction; local \u0026ldquo;dialects\u0026rdquo; could be as different from one another as eg Spanish is from Portuguese, so villagers might not even be able to understand the tax collectors. Worst of all, there was no such thing as a census in France until the 17th century, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a good idea of how many people or villages there were.\nKings usually solved this problem by leaving the tax collection up to local lords, who presumably knew the idiosyncracies of their own domains. But one step wasn\u0026rsquo;t always enough. If the King only knew Dukes, and the Dukes only knew Barons, and the Barons only knew village headmen, and it was only the village headmen who actually knew anything about the peasants, then you needed a four-step chain to get any taxes. Each link in the chain had an incentive to collect as much as they could and give up as little as they could get away with. So on the one end, the peasants were paying backbreaking punitive taxes. And on the other, the Royal Treasurer was handing the King half a loaf of moldy bread and saying \u0026ldquo;Here you go, Sire, apparently this is all the grain in France.\u0026rdquo;\nSo from the beginning, kings had an incentive to make the country \u0026ldquo;legible\u0026rdquo; – that is, so organized and well-indexed that it was easy to know everything about everyone and collect/double-check taxes. Also from the beginning, nobles had an incentive to frustrate the kings so that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be out of a job. And commoners, who figured that anything which made it easier for the State to tax them and interfere in their affairs was bad news, usually resisted too.\nIV So the early modern period is defined by an uneasy truce between states who want to be able to count and standardize everything, and citizens who don\u0026rsquo;t want to let them. Enter High Modernism [High modernism].\nScott uses Le Corbusier as the epitome of five High Modernist principles.\n[T]here can be no compromise with the existing infrastructure. It was designed by superstitious people who didn\u0026rsquo;t have architecture degrees, or at the very least got their architecture degrees in the past and so were insufficiently Modern. The more completely it is bulldozed to make way for the Glorious Future, the better. [H]uman needs can be abstracted and calculated. A human needs X amount of food. A human needs X amount of water. A human needs X amount of light, and prefers to travel at X speed, and wants to live within X miles of the workplace. These needs are easily calculable by experiment, and a good city is the one built to satisfy these needs and ignore any competing frivolities. [T]he solution is the solution. It is universal. The rational design for Moscow is the same as the rational design for Paris is the same as the rational design for Chandigarh, India. As a corollary, all of these cities ought to look exactly the same. It is maybe permissible to adjust for obstacles like mountains or lakes. But only if you are on too short a budget to follow the rationally correct solution of leveling the mountain and draining the lake to make your city truly optimal. [A]ll of the relevant rules should be explicitly determined by technocrats, then followed to the letter by their subordinates. Following these rules is better than trying to use your intuition, in the same way that using the laws of physics to calculate the heat from burning something is better than just trying to guess, or following an evidence-based clinical algorithm is better than just prescribing whatever you feel like. [T]here is nothing whatsoever to be gained or learned from the people involved (eg the city\u0026rsquo;s future citizens). You are a rational modern scientist with an architecture degree who has already calculated out the precise value for all relevant urban parameters. They are yokels who probably cannot even spell the word architecture, let alone usefully contribute to it. They probably make all of their decisions based on superstition or tradition or something, and their input should be ignored For Their Own Good. [formatting mine]\nWhat happened? Scott writes:\nMost of those who have moved to Brasilia from other cities are amazed to discover \u0026ldquo;that it is a city without crowds.\u0026rdquo; People complain that Brasilia lacks the bustle of street life, that it has none of the busy street corners and long stretches of storefront facades that animate a sidewalk for pedestrians. For them, it is almost as if the founders of Brasilia, rather than having planned a city, have actually planned to prevent a city. The most common way they put it is to say that Brasilia \u0026ldquo;lacks street corners,\u0026ldquo;by which they mean that it lacks the complex intersections of dense neighborhoods comprising residences and public cafes and restaurants with places for leisure, work, and shopping.\nWhile Brasilia provides well for some human needs, the functional separation of work from residence and of both from commerce and entertainment, the great voids between superquadra, and a road system devoted exclusively to motorized traffic make the disappearance of the street corner a foregone conclusion. The plan did eliminate traffic jams; it also eliminated the welcome and familiar pedestrian jams that one of Holston\u0026rsquo;s informants called \u0026ldquo;the point of social conviviality\nThe term brasilite, meaning roughly Brasilia-itis,which was coined by the first-generation residents, nicely captures the trauma they experienced. As a mock clinical condition, it connotes a rejection of the standardization and anonymity of life in Brasilia. \u0026ldquo;They use the term brasilite to refer to their feelings about a daily life without the pleasures-the distractions, conversations, flirtations, and little rituals of outdoor life in other Brazilian cities.\u0026rdquo; Meeting someone normally requires seeing them either at their apartment [First place] or at work [Second place]. Even if we allow for the initial simplifying premise of Brasilia\u0026rsquo;s being an administrative city, there is nonetheless a bland anonymity built into the very structure of the capital. The population simply lacks the small accessible spaces that they could colonize and stamp with the character of their activity, as they have done historically in Rio and Sao Paulo. To be sure, the inhabitants of Brasilia haven\u0026rsquo;t had much time to modify the city through their practices, but the city is designed to be fairly recalcitrant to their efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;Brasilite,\u0026rdquo; as a term, also underscores how the built environment affects those who dwell in it. Compared to life in Rio and Sao Paulo, with their color and variety, the daily round in bland, repetitive, austere Brasilia must have resembled life in a sensory deprivation tank. The recipe for high-modernist urban planning, while it may have created formal order and functional segregation, did so at the cost of a sensorily impoverished and monotonous environment-an environment that inevitably took its toll on the spirits of its residents.\nThe anonymity induced by Brasilia is evident from the scale and exterior of the apartments that typically make up each residential superquadra. For superquadra residents, the two most frequent complaints are the sameness of the apartment blocks and the isolation of the residences (\u0026ldquo;In Brasilia, there is only house and work\u0026rdquo;). The facade of each block is strictly geometric and egalitarian. Nothing distinguishes the exterior of one apartment from another; there are not even balconies that would allow residents to add distinctive touches and create semipublic spaces.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI never really \u0026ldquo;got\u0026rdquo; Jane Jacobs. I originally interpreted her as arguing that it was great for cities to be noisy and busy and full of crowds, and that we should build neighborhoods that are confusing and hard to get through to force people to interact with each other and prevent them from being able to have privacy, and no one should be allowed to live anywhere quiet or nice. As somebody who (thanks to the public school system, etc) has had my share of being forced to interact with people, and of being placed in situations where it is deliberately difficult to have any privacy or time to myself, I figured Jane Jacobs was just a jerk.\nBut Scott has kind of made me come around. He rehabilitates her as someone who was responding to the very real excesses of High Modernism. She was the first person who really said \u0026ldquo;Hey, maybe people like being in cute little neighborhoods\u0026rdquo;. Her complaint wasn\u0026rsquo;t really against privacy or order per se as it was against extreme High Modernist perversions of those concepts that people empirically hated. And her background makes this all too understandable – she started out as a journalist covering poor African-Americans who lived in the projects and had some of the same complaints as Brazilians.\nHer critique of Le Corbusierism was mostly what you would expect, but Scott extracts some points useful for their contrast with the Modernist points earlier:\n[E]xisting structures are evolved organisms built by people trying to satisfy their social goals. They contain far more wisdom about people\u0026rsquo;s needs and desires than anybody could formally enumerate. Any attempt at urban planning should try to build on this encoded knowledge, not detract from it. [M]an does not live by bread alone. People don\u0026rsquo;t want the right amount of Standardized Food Product, they want social interaction, culture, art, coziness, and a host of other things nobody will ever be able to calculate. Existing structures have already been optimized for these things, and unless you\u0026rsquo;re really sure you understand all of them, you should be reluctant to disturb them [Chesterton\u0026rsquo;s fence]. [S]olutions are local. Americans want different things than Africans or Indians. One proof of this is that New York looks different from Lagos and from Delhi. Even if you are the world\u0026rsquo;s best American city planner, you should be very concerned that you have no idea what people in Africa need, and you should be very reluctant to design an African city without extensive consultation of people who understand the local environment. [E]ven a very smart and well-intentioned person who is on board with points 1-3 will never be able to produce a set of rules. Most of people\u0026rsquo;s knowledge is implicit [Implicit knowledge], and most rule codes are quickly replaced by informal systems [Tacit knowledge] of things that work which are much more effective (the classic example of this is work-to-rule [Work-to-rule] strikes). [A]lthough well-educated technocrats may understand principles which give them some advantages in their domain, they are hopeless without the on-the-ground experience of the people they are trying to serve, whose years of living in their environment and dealing with it every day have given them a deep practical knowledge which is difficult to codify. [formatting mine]\nV Even in less exotic locales like Russia, the peasant farmers were extraordinary experts on the conditions of their own farms, their own climates, and their own crops. Take all of these people, transport them a thousand miles away, and give them a perfectly rectangular grid to grow Wheat Cultivar #6 on, and you have a recipe for disaster.\nVI So if this was such a bad idea, why did everyone keep doing it?\nIn short, governing bodies continued (and continue) to push these solutions not because they solve the people\u0026rsquo;s problems but because they solve the problems the governing bodies have.\nHistorically, the relative illegibility to outsiders of some urban neighborhoods has provided a vital margin of political safety from control by outside elites. A simple way of determining whether this margin exists is to ask if an outsider would have needed a local guide in order to find her way successfully. If the answer is yes, then the community or terrain in question enjoys at least a small measure of insulation from outside intrusion. Coupled with patterns of local solidarity, this insulation has proven politically valuable in such disparate contexts as eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century urban riots over bread prices in Europe, the Front de Liberation Nationale\u0026rsquo;s tenacious resistance to the French in the Casbah of Algiers, and the politics of the bazaar that helped to bring down the Shah of Iran. Illegibility, then, has been and remains a reliable resource for political autonomy\nThis was a particular problem in Paris, which was famous for a series of urban insurrections in the 19th century (think Les Miserables, but about once every ten years or so). Although these generally failed, they were hard to suppress because locals knew the \u0026ldquo;terrain\u0026rdquo; and the streets were narrow enough to barricade. Slums full of poor people gathered together formed tight communities where revolutionary ideas could easily spread. The late 19th-century redesign of Paris had the explicit design of destroying these areas and splitting up poor people somewhere far away from the city center where they couldn\u0026rsquo;t do any harm.\nSo although modernist cities and farms may have started out as attempts to help citizens with living and farming, they ended up as contributors to the great government project of legibility and taxing people effectively.\nSeeing Like A State summarizes the sort of on-the-ground ultra-empirical knowledge that citizens have of city design and peasants of farming as metis, a Greek term meaning \u0026ldquo;practical wisdom\u0026rdquo;. I was a little concerned about this because they seem like two different things. The average citizen knows nothing about city design and in fact does not design cities; cities sort of happen in a weird way through cultural evolution or whatever. The average farmer knows a lot about farming (even if it is implicit and not as book learning) and applies that knowledge directly in how they farm. But Scott thinks these are more or less the same thing, that this thing is a foundation of successful communities and industries, and that ignoring and suppressing it is what makes collective farms and modernist planned cities so crappy. He generalizes this further to almost every aspect of a society \u0026ndash; its language, laws, social norms, and economy. But this is all done very quickly, and I feel like there was a sleight of hand between \u0026ldquo;each farmer eventually figures out how to farm well\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;social norms converge on good values\u0026rdquo;.\nInsofar as Scott squares the above circle, he seems to think that many actors competing with each other will eventually carve out a beneficial equilibrium better than that of any centralized authority. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mesh will with my own fear that many actors competing with each other will eventually shoot themselves in the foot and destroy everything, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really seen a careful investigation of when we get one versus the other.\nVII What are we to make of all of this?\nWell, for one thing, Scott basically admits to stacking the dice against High Modernism and legibility. He admits that the organic livable cities of old had life expectancies in the forties because nobody got any light or fresh air and they were all packed together with no sewers and so everyone just died of cholera. He admits that at some point agricultural productivity multiplied by like a thousand times and the Green Revolution saved millions of lives and all that, and probably that has something to do with scientific farming methods and rectangular grids. He admits that it\u0026rsquo;s pretty convenient having a unit of measurement that local lords can\u0026rsquo;t change whenever they feel like it. Even modern timber farms seem pretty successful. After all those admissions, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to see what\u0026rsquo;s left of his case.\n(also, I grew up in Irvine, the most planned of planned cities, and I loved it.)\nWhat Scott eventually says is that he\u0026rsquo;s not against legibility and modernism per se, but he wants to present them as ingredients in a cocktail of state failure. You need a combination of four things to get a disaster like Soviet collective farming (or his other favorite example, compulsory village settlement in Tanzania). First, a government incentivized to seek greater legibility for its population and territory. Second, a High Modernist ideology. Third, authoritarianism. And fourth, a \u0026ldquo;prostrate civil society\u0026rdquo;, like in Russia after the Revolution, or in colonies after the Europeans took over.\nI think his theory is that the back-and-forth between centralized government and civil society allows scientific advances to be implemented smoothly instead of just plowing over everyone in a way that leads to disaster. I also think that maybe a big part of it is incremental versus sudden: western farming did well because it got to incrementally add advances and see how they worked, but when you threw the entire edifice at Tanzania it crashed and burned.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not really sure what\u0026rsquo;s left. Authoritarianism is bad? Destroying civil society is bad? You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do things when you have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and all you\u0026rsquo;ve got to go on is your rectangle fetish? The book contained some great historical tidbits, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what overarching lesson I learned from it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t think Scott\u0026rsquo;s preference for metis over scientific omnipotence has value. I think it has lots of value. I see this all the time in psychiatry, which always has been and to some degree still is really High Modernist. We are educated people who know a lot about mental health, dealing with a poor population who (in the case of one of my patients) refers to Haldol as \u0026ldquo;Hound Dog\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to get in the trap of thinking that you know better than these people, especially since you often do (I will never understand how many people are shocked when I diagnose their sleep disorder as having something to do with them drinking fifteen cups of coffee a day).\nBut psychiatric patients have a metis of dealing with their individual diseases the same way peasants have a metis of dealing with their individual plots of land. My favorite example of this is doctors who learn their patients are taking marijuana, refuse to keep prescribing them their vitally important drugs unless the patient promises to stop, and then gets surprised when the patients end up decompensating because the marijuana was keeping them together. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying smoking marijuana is a good thing. I\u0026rsquo;m saying that for some people it\u0026rsquo;s a load-bearing piece of their mental edifice. And if you take it away without any replacement they will fall apart. And they have explained this to you a thousand times and you didn\u0026rsquo;t believe them.\nThere are so many fricking patients who respond to sedative medications by becoming stimulated, or stimulant medications by becoming sedated, or who become more anxious whenever they do anti-anxiety exercises, or who hallucinate when placed on some super common medication that has never caused hallucinations in anyone else, or who become suicidal if you try to reassure them that things aren\u0026rsquo;t so bad, or any other completely perverse and ridiculous violation of the natural order that you can think of. And the only redeeming feature of all of this is that the patients themselves know all of this stuff super-well and are usually happy to tell you if you ask.\nI can totally imagine going into a psychiatric clinic armed with the Evidence-Based Guidelines the same way Le Corbusier went into Moscow and Paris armed with his Single Rational City Plan and the same way the agricultural scientists went into Tanzania armed with their List Of Things That Definitely Work In Europe. I expect it would have about the same effect for about the same reason.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo fine, Scott is completely right here. But I\u0026rsquo;m only bringing this up because it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve already thought about. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t already believe this, I\u0026rsquo;d be indifferent between applying the narrative of the wise Tanzanian farmers knowing more than their English colonizers, versus the narrative of the dumb yokels who refuse to get vaccines because they might cause autism. Heuristics work until they don\u0026rsquo;t. Scott provides us with these great historical examples of local knowledge outdoing scientific acumen, but other stories present us with great historical examples of the opposite, and when to apply which heuristic seems really unclear. Even \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t bulldoze civil society and try to change everything at once\u0026rdquo; goes astray sometimes; the Meiji Restoration was wildly successful by doing exactly that.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:scottSeeingStateHowCertainSchemesImproveHumanConditionHaveFailed2020 NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewSeeingState2017 Backlinks Tanner Greer | Tradition Is Smarter Than You Are James C.

Cheap global talk and travel continue to tie our global economy and culture more closely together. But in the distant future, our descendants will probably have spread out across space, and redesigned their minds and bodies to explode Cambrian-style into a vast space of possible creatures. If they are free enough to choose where to go and what to become, our distant descendants will fragment into diverse local economies and cultures.\nGiven a similar freedom of fertility, most of our distant descendants will also live near a subsistence level. Per-capita wealth has only been rising lately because income has grown faster than population. But if income only doubled every century, in a million years that would be a factor of 103000, which seems (a) impossible to achieve with only the 1070 atoms of our galaxy available by then. Yes we have seen a remarkable demographic transition, wherein richer nations have fewer kids, but we already see contrarian subgroups like Hutterites, Hmongs, or Mormons that grow much faster. So unless strong central controls prevent it, over the long run such groups will easily grow (a) faster than the economy, making per person income drop to near subsistence levels. Even so, they will be basically happy (a) in such a world.\nOur distant descendants will also likely have hit diminishing returns to discovery; by then most everything worth knowing will be known by many; truly new and important discoveries will be quite rare. Complete introspection will be feasible, and immortality will be available to the few who can afford it. Wild nature will be mostly gone, and universal coordination and destruction will both be far harder than today.\nSo what will these distant descendants think of their ancestors? They will find much in common with our distant hunting ancestors, who also continued for ages at near subsistence level in a vast fragmented world with slow growth amid rare slow contact with strange distant cultures. While those ancestors were quite ignorant about their world, and immersed in a vast wild nature instead of a vast space of people, their behavior was still pretty well adapted to the world they lived in. While they suffered many misconceptions, those illusions rarely made them much worse off; their behavior was usually adaptive.\nWhen our distant descendants think about our era, however, differences will loom larger. Yes they will see that we were more like them in knowing more things, and in having less contact with a wild nature. But our brief period of very rapid growth and discovery and our globally integrated economy and culture will be quite foreign to them. Yet even these differences will pale relative to one huge difference: our lives are far more dominated by consequential delusions: wildly false beliefs and non-adaptive values that matter. While our descendants may explore delusion-dominated virtual realities, they will well understand that such things cannot be real, and don\u0026rsquo;t much influence history. In contrast, we live in the brief but important \u0026ldquo;dreamtime\u0026rdquo; when delusions drove history. Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nPerhaps most important, our descendants may remember how history hung by a precarious thread on a few crucial coordination choices that our highly integrated rapidly changing world did or might have allowed us to achieve, and the strange delusions that influenced such choices. These choices might have been about global warming, rampaging robots, nuclear weapons, bioterror, etc.\nBibliography References Hanson, Robin. n.d. “This Is the Dream Time.” Accessed June 21, 2022. https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html.

It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. [\u0026hellip;]\nTo perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible.","title":"Gaussian elimination"},{"content":" In linear algebra, a matrix is in echelon form if it has the shape resulting from a Gaussian elimination [Gaussian elimination].\nA matrix being in row echelon form means that Gaussian elimination has operated on the rows, and column echelon form means that Gaussian elimination has operated on the columns. In other words, a matrix is in column echelon form if its transpose is in row echelon form. Therefore, only row echelon forms are considered in the remainder of this article. The similar properties of column echelon form are easily deduced by transposing all the matrices. Specifically, a matrix is in row echelon form if\nAll rows consisting of only zeroes are at the bottom.

Then for all edges, if the distance to the destination can be shortened by taking the edge, the distance is updated to the new lower value.\nThe core of the algorithm is a loop that scans across all edges at every loop. For every \\(i \\leq |V| - 1\\), at the end of the \\(i\\text{-th}\\) iteration, from any vertex v, following the predecessor trail recorded in predecessor yields a path that has a total weight that is at most distance[v], and further, distance[v] is a lower bound to the length of any path from source to v that uses at most i edges.\nSince the longest possible path without a cycle can be \\(|V| - 1\\) edges, the edges must be scanned \\(|V| - 1\\) times to ensure the shortest path has been found for all nodes. A final scan of all the edges is performed and if any distance is updated, then a path of length \\(|V|\\) edges has been found which can only occur if at least one negative cycle exists in the graph.\n(“BellmanFord Algorithm” 2022)\nBellman-Ford implementation in Python\nBibliography References “BellmanFord Algorithm.” 2022.

It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.\nAt each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes\n\\(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\\)\nwhere n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. A* terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended. The heuristic function is problem-specific.\n(“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nDijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm [Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm], as another example of a uniform-cost search algorithm, can be viewed as a special case of A* where \\(h(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\).\n(“A* Search Algorithm” 2022)\nLike Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm, A*\u0026rsquo;s implementation uses Dynamic programming.\nWhat does the \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; mean? The reason is that scientists first came up with an improved version of the Dijkstra algorithm they called A1. Later on, the inventors of A* discovered an improvement of A1 that they called A2. These people then managed to prove that A2 was actually optimal under some assumptions on the heuristic in use. Because A2 was optimal, it was renamed A*. In science, and in optimisation in particular, a \u0026quot; * \u0026quot; symbol is often used to denote optimal solutions. Some also interpret the \u0026quot; * \u0026quot; as meaning \u0026ldquo;any version number\u0026rdquo; since it was proven impossible to build an \u0026ldquo;A3\u0026rdquo; algorithm that would outperform A2/A*.\nBy the way, in this context, \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it reaches the optimal solution, but that it does so while exploring the minimum number of nodes. Of course, A* is also complete, which means it reaches the optimal solution (if we use an admissible heuristic).\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:francoisrAnswerWhatDoesStarAlgorithmMean2016)\nBibliography References “A* Search Algorithm.” 2022.

This is the pitfall.\nThoughts This is one of my Favorites.\nI feel seen by this years-old blog post and it\u0026rsquo;s unpleasant. Particularly:\nAn overinflated sense of your own abilities creates a constant state of production deficit, because you assume that you can make it up with a burst of brilliance and/or crunch.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s been me for years now. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful to see it written out.\nRelated: Jacob Kaplan-Moss | Embrace the Grind\nNotes If my coworkers were grinding through stuff that took them 20 hours, I\u0026rsquo;d be all \u0026ldquo;I work smart, not hard\u0026rdquo; with accompanying snarky eye roll, and I\u0026rsquo;d assume I could bust through an equivalent work load in four hours and still look like a goddamn superhero.\nAnd sometimes I could, so, hey, validation!\nAnd you can skate by like this (God knows I did) for a long time before a couple things eventually rear their heads and bite you in your entitled face.\nProductivity deficit: Your attitude writing checks your work ethic can\u0026rsquo;t cash An overinflated sense of your own abilities creates a constant state of production deficit, because you assume that you can make it up with a burst of brilliance and/or crunch.\nBut there is no countering surplus to offset the deficit. The only way surpluses show up is when you finish a (presumably) hard task much faster than you anticipated. But instead of banking the surplus (i.e. moving on immediately to your next task), you spend it relaxing and screwing off because, whew, you just earned a small vacation by busting shit out in an hour that you thought would take all day. Hey, what\u0026rsquo;s on Facebook and Twitter right now? Do I have any new mail? No? I wonder if anyone has tweeted something recently since the last time I checked\u0026hellip;what about Reddit? Oh, an inspirational/funny/cool YouTube video, it\u0026rsquo;s only eight minutes long, let me watch it now! (Eight minutes later) Sweet\u0026hellip;what\u0026rsquo;s up Twitter? Oh man, I have to make a snarky response, but first I have to Google for that XKCD comic that totally makes my point for me\u0026hellip;\nAnd before you know it, the day is done, and you\u0026rsquo;re still feeling good because you finished in one hour what should have taken all day, so all good, right?\nTrap of the easy task And yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s often all good, but when operating at a slight deficit things can go pear shaped quickly when you accidentally spring the trap of the easy task. Tasks so trivial that they barely register as work. Update an SDK? Hour, tops. Implement this feature that I\u0026rsquo;ve already done on every other platform? Hour, tops. [\u0026hellip;]\nIn other words, an easy task like this is so easy that it\u0026rsquo;s a constant time cost for everyone irrespective of ability, so there\u0026rsquo;s no opportunity nor need for crazy overestimation since what could possibly go wrong?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo what should have taken less than an hour took a week.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like having a perfect monetary budget that assumes no crazy \u0026ldquo;one time\u0026rdquo; only bills, except life is full of crazy one time only bills and the only way you can keep those under control is by giving yourself a budgetary capacitor to dampen the fluctuations.\nAnd now you\u0026rsquo;re defensive about losing a week to something stupid because you budgeted an hour for it and waited until the last second to do it and now the schedule has gone to hell, but it\u0026rsquo;s not your fault, because it could have happened to anyone! But if you had banked your surplus hours before and/or worked at closer to your theoretical peak effectiveness then this type of thing would get absorbed in the wash.\nAnd now you live in a state of mild panic because you\u0026rsquo;re way smarter than all this but you\u0026rsquo;re never actually getting things done on time.\nIdentity recalibration crisis Which leads to a potential identity recalibration crisis upon landing at a company with high performers that work hard and smart. And that will happen if you\u0026rsquo;re good. Now you\u0026rsquo;re no longer at the top of the curve. In fact, shit, you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle or bottom of the curve, a situation your brain probably never considered as an option.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSometimes it takes a while for this to sink in. Sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sink in at all, and you\u0026rsquo;re let go because you\u0026rsquo;re not very productive compared to your new team of high performers. Sometimes it sinks in, and you panic and get depressed because your self-image has always been that of being the strongest swimmer in the school, and right now you\u0026rsquo;re just trying not to drown, much less keep up with everyone else.\nBut ideally you shrug off the old counter productive mentality and habits and emerge as another one of the high functioning team members, but that can take a lot of work, particularly if you have to get over years of giving it twenty percent.\nKilling the underachiever If my pithy advice were little more than \u0026ldquo;Be more like John Carmack\u0026rdquo; then I can imagine a lot of readers throwing up their hands and saying \u0026ldquo;Well, fuck it, I\u0026rsquo;m a lost cause, because that\u0026rsquo;s not going to happen.\u0026rdquo; But what I can do is relate some of the things that helped me kill off some of my underachieving habits. The point isn\u0026rsquo;t to become a superstar, it\u0026rsquo;s to become better [Get good], since that\u0026rsquo;s always the first step.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t believe in mechanical solutions (\u0026ldquo;Turn off the internet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Listen to music\u0026rdquo;, and stuff like that) because I don\u0026rsquo;t think they address the core issues, which are psychological. Instead I found that I had to do the following.\nI disagree with the author\u0026rsquo;s assessment that solutions such as \u0026ldquo;turning off the internet\u0026rdquo; are ineffective. This reads similarly to me as saying that someone should recover without crutches. Crutches are useful and important. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to say it\u0026rsquo;s a binary in which you can\u0026rsquo;t do both \u0026ndash; you can and you should. Embrace crutches and strive to build mental resilience, Grit, the capacity for Deep work, etc.\nDevelop self-awareness\nIt took working with John Carmack and other high productivity programmers and admitting that they were way more productive than me before I really understood how much more productive I could be. In other words, if you don\u0026rsquo;t admit it\u0026rsquo;s something worth improving, then obviously you\u0026rsquo;re not going to search for a solution, and if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, you should go here or here.\nGive a shit\nOriginally I called this \u0026ldquo;develop a sense of urgency\u0026rdquo;, but really it\u0026rsquo;s just about caring about getting your work done. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter what you specifically care about! It can be your professional image, your product, your team, your customers, whatever. You just have to care about something that will drive you to getting things done, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t, apathy will occupy that void.\nMinimize uncertainty\nIn another blog article, Productivity vs. Uncertainty and Apathy, I talk about how poorly defined goals can lead to poor productivity. If it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what you need to get done today, then there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable chance you won\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything today.\nCommit to getting something done every day\nWhen you show up in the morning have a well defined set of things to finish that day. Stay as late as you have to in order to finish. By committing to finishing that task other distractions will naturally fall by the wayside. For example, I have jiu-jitsu training at 7pm. If I screw off too much during the day, I don\u0026rsquo;t get to train. Also, by committing to a task, you avoid \u0026ldquo;being busy\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;getting work done\u0026rdquo;, they\u0026rsquo;re not the same thing.\nNever say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll finish it up tomorrow\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll make up for it by coming in early/staying late/working the weekend\u0026rdquo;\nThis is an easy trap to get into, where you keep incurring time debt until at some point you realize you\u0026rsquo;re now three weeks behind on a task that should have taken two days. This is like racking up credit card bills assuming you can pay them off later. Which is fine, until \u0026ldquo;later\u0026rdquo; arrives and you\u0026rsquo;ve only accumulated more debt.\nDo not overpromise to make up for poor productivity\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a tendency when we\u0026rsquo;re falling behind to try to overcompensate with future promises. \u0026ldquo;When I\u0026rsquo;m done, it\u0026rsquo;ll be AWESOME\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m late, but I\u0026rsquo;m positive I\u0026rsquo;ll be done by Monday\u0026rdquo;. By doing those things we just build more debt we can\u0026rsquo;t pay off, and that will eventually lead to a catastrophic melt down when the super final absolutely last deadline date shows up. Just get shit done, don\u0026rsquo;t talk about how you\u0026rsquo;re going to get shit done.\nHave an objective productivity metric\nThis is a mechanical thing, but it acts as a reasonable backstop. If you have changelogs you can reference, then it\u0026rsquo;s easy to sit down on Friday and ask yourself \u0026ldquo;What have I done this week?\u0026rdquo; And if you know that it\u0026rsquo;s possible for others to check on you, then it makes you take each day a lot more seriously. If you judge your value solely on output, not subjective things like \u0026ldquo;being smart\u0026rdquo;, you will be more productive.\nAccept that \u0026ldquo;the grind\u0026rdquo; is part of the job\nA friend of mine\u0026rsquo;s father has a great quote: \u0026ldquo;Son, i don\u0026rsquo;t wake up every day and go to a place called fun. I wake up and go to a place called work\u0026rdquo; You can\u0026rsquo;t get irate or frustrated that the bulk of the day is typing in boring code and dealing with bugs and other people.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:SmartGuyProductivityPitfalls Backlinks Work smart and hard On productivity Jacob Kaplan-Moss | Embrace the Grind ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/9ed16182-a4a5-4bf6-a5c7-b6196c6eca97/","summary":"Unknown, (NO_ITEM_DATA:SmartGuyProductivityPitfalls)\nSummary The simplicity of \u0026ldquo;Work smart, not hard\u0026rdquo; is deceptive.

Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant\u0026rsquo;s body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people\u0026rsquo;s limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:[7][2]\nA group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: \u0026ldquo;We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable\u0026rdquo;. So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, \u0026ldquo;This being is like a thick snake\u0026rdquo;. For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, \u0026ldquo;is a wall\u0026rdquo;. Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.\nIn some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant\u0026rsquo;s body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.[4][7]\nThe parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and fallacies; broadly, the parable implies that one\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation. In this respect, it provides an easily understood and practical example that illustrates ontologic reasoning. That is, simply put, what things exist, what is their true nature, and how can their relations to each other be accurately categorized? For example, is the elephant\u0026rsquo;s trunk a snake, or its legs trees, just because they share some similarities with those? Or is that just a misapprehension that differs from an underlying reality? And how should human beings treat each other as they strive to understand better (anger, respect, tolerance or intolerance)?\n(“Blind Men and an Elephant” 2022)\nRelated: Lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True\nBibliography References “Blind Men and an Elephant.” 2022.

This recyclable waste can come from numerous places the most prevalent being from the trimming process where layers of leather hard clay are trimmed away from the pots that fill up the wheel tray with thin coils of clay. As they\u0026rsquo;re so thin, and disintegrate really easily, I immediately just chuck them into the reclaim bucket that lives next to my wheel and anytime my tray gets full I simply just dump them straight into it. Anything thicker than these turnings say a larger chunk of leather hard clay \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll never throw that directly into the reclaimed bucket if it\u0026rsquo;s still slightly wet as it\u0026rsquo;ll take weeks to degrade to a point where it can be recycled nicely so, instead, I\u0026rsquo;ll let it turn completely bone dry before placing it into this bucket. I also add things like the slops left over from my throwing water and when all these trimmings and other bits of waste are soaked overnight it\u0026rsquo;ll slake down into a fine slurry.\nWhenever I\u0026rsquo;m throwing pots if I need to remove the slip off my hands I do so against this sharp edge of a bucket filled with water. Then at the end of the day once I\u0026rsquo;ve finished throwing all my pots I\u0026rsquo;ll sponge down the wheel and then I\u0026rsquo;ll clean all of my tools and I\u0026rsquo;ll ring out the sponge in that same bucket of water. Even though I have a clay trap under the sink in my studio I still wash all of my tools and sponges and towels and things in this bucket of water first. I also don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily worry about cleaning every tool perfectly as, under normal circumstances, I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to use them in the next few days. I\u0026rsquo;ll lay out all of these wash tools on a cloth to dry overnight and at the same time all the clay will settle in a layer at the bottom.\nThe following morning I then carefully pour away the water trying my very best not to disturb the settled clay in the bottom. I swirl together what\u0026rsquo;s left and then this once again is added to my reclaim bucket.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAgain after a week or maybe two of throwing and trimming the bucket usually gets full. I then use a large sponge to remove as much excess water from the top as possible \u0026ndash; which I ring out in my other bucket of water that will eventually get added back to this. I then drag the bucket over to my plaster bats (which are made from a mixture of 80 potters plaster and 20 casting plaster, for strength). I place these plaster bats onto three kiln props so air can get beneath them and help dry them out.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re heavy thick bats that\u0026rsquo;ll absorb a lot of water from the clay that\u0026rsquo;s placed onto it, yet, they can still quickly become saturated and from time to time when they\u0026rsquo;re not in use I\u0026rsquo;ll either take them outside to sit in the sun or I\u0026rsquo;ll place them underneath my gas kiln when I\u0026rsquo;m firing it. I used to prop them up with wooden slats but they quickly become very moldy whereas these kiln props can\u0026rsquo;t. They\u0026rsquo;re also given a scrub clean every now and then to dislodge any loose plaster that might find its way into your clay body which you definitely want to try and avoid as small specks of plaster lodged in clay once fired can cause the clay and glaze above it to shear off, which is something potters called lime popping [Lime popping], so if you do recycle your clay like this and you find a little hard bead of white in your clay it\u0026rsquo;s best to remove it.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:floriangadsbyHowRecycleMyStonewarePotteryReclaim2022 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/670522f7-a37e-4d22-9bba-4f59386c7b4c/","summary":"Florian Gadsby, (NO_ITEM_DATA:floriangadsbyHowRecycleMyStonewarePotteryReclaim2022)\nSummary Thoughts Notes One of the greatest things about working with clay is the simple fact that any scraps you end up with throughout the making process can easily just be recycled and reused and eventually thrown into new pots.

Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.\nMastery learning methods suggest that the focus of instruction should be the time required for different students to learn the same material and achieve the same level of mastery. This is very much in contrast with classic models of teaching that focus more on differences in students\u0026rsquo; ability and where all students are given approximately the same amount of time to learn and the same set of instructions.\nIn mastery learning, there is a shift in responsibilities, so that the students\u0026rsquo; failure is considered to be more due to the instruction and not necessarily their lack of ability. This also means teachers\u0026rsquo; attention to individual students is emphasised as opposed to assessing group performance. Therefore, in a mastery learning environment, the challenge becomes providing enough time and employing instructional strategies so that all students can achieve the same level of learning.\nSince its conception, mastery learning has empirically been demonstrated to be effective in improving education outcomes in a variety of settings. Its effectiveness is influenced by the subject being taught, whether testing is designed locally or nationally, course pace and the amount of feedback provided to students.\n(“Mastery Learning” 2022)\nBibliography References “Mastery Learning.” 2022.

One of the worst things you can do is blow your 5 tries within a day or two. You can think of the \u0026lsquo;forgetting curve\u0026rsquo; [Forgetting curve] as being like a chart of a radioactive half-life: each review bumps your memory up in strength 50% of the chart, say, but review doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much in the early days because the memory simply hasn\u0026rsquo;t decayed much! [\u0026hellip;]\nA graphical representation of the forgetting curve:\nEven better, it\u0026rsquo;s known that active recall is a far superior method of learning than simply passively being exposed to information.⁠6 Spacing also scales to huge quantities of information; [\u0026hellip;]\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re go good, why aren\u0026rsquo;t you rich? Of course, [cramming] is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can\u0026rsquo;t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I\u0026rsquo;m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠\nBecause it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠12⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! [\u0026hellip;]\nAcross experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing\u0026hellip;.When they do consider spacing, they often exhibit the illusion that massed study is more effective than spaced study, even when the reverse is true (⁠Dunlosky \u0026amp; Nelson, 1994 (a)⁠; Kornell \u0026amp; Bjork, 2008a; ⁠Simon \u0026amp; Bjork2001 (a)⁠; Zechmeister \u0026amp; Shaughnessy, 1980 (a)).\nAs one would expect if the testing and spacing effects are real things, students who naturally test themselves and study well in advance of exams tend to have higher GPAs.⁠ If we interpret questions as tests, we are not surprised to see that 1-on-1 tutoring works dramatically better (a) [Bloom\u0026rsquo;s 2 sigma problem] than regular teaching and that tutored students answer orders of magnitude more questions⁠⁠.\nThis short-term perspective is not a good thing in the long term, of course. Knowledge builds on knowledge; one is not learning independent bits of trivia [Andy Matuschak | Knowledge Work Should Accrete]. Richard Hamming recalls in \u0026ldquo;You and Your Research\u0026rdquo;:\nYou observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs⁠. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest⁠.\u0026rdquo; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode\u0026rsquo;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.\nThis long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant \u0026amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near \u0026amp; vivid. (See hyperbolic discounting (a)⁠.)\nLiterature review Review summary To bring it all together with the gist:\ntesting is effective and comes with minimal ⁠negative factors (a)\nexpanding spacing is roughly as good as or better than (wide) fixed intervals, but expanding is more convenient and the default\ntesting (and hence spacing) is best on intellectual, highly factual, verbal domains, but may still work in many low-level domains\nthe research favors questions which force the user to use their memory as much as possible; in descending order of preference:\nfree recall short answers multiple-choice Cloze deletion recognition the research literature is comprehensive and most questions have been answered - somewhere.\nthe most common mistakes with spaced repetition are\nformulating poor questions and answers assuming it will help you learn, as opposed to maintain and preserve what one already learned⁠^{54} (a)⁠. (It\u0026rsquo;s hard to learn from cards, but if you have learned something, it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to then devise a set of flashcards that will test your weak points.) Using it How much to add [\u0026hellip;] That\u0026rsquo;s our key rule of thumb that lets us decide what to learn and what to forget: if, over your lifetime, you will spend more than 5 minutes looking something up or will lose more than 5 minutes as a result of not knowing something, then it\u0026rsquo;s worthwhile to memorize it with spaced repetition. 5 minutes is the line that divides trivia from useful data.⁠ (There might seem to be thousands of flashcards that meet the 5 minute rule. That\u0026rsquo;s fine. Spaced repetition can accommodate dozens of thousands of cards. [\u0026hellip;])\nThe workload On average, when I\u0026rsquo;m studying a new topic, I\u0026rsquo;ll add 3-20 questions a day. Combined with my particular memory, I usually review about 90 or 100 items a day (out of the total \u0026gt;18,300). This takes under 20 minutes, which is not too bad.\nWhen to review When should one review? In the morning? In the evening? Any old time? The studies demonstrating the spacing effect do not control or vary the time of day, so in one sense, the answer is: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter - if it did matter, there would be considerable variance in how effective the effect is based on when a particular study had its subjects do their reviews.\nSo one reviews at whatever time is convenient. Convenience makes one more likely to stick with it, and sticking with it overpowers any temporary improvement.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:branwenSpacedRepetitionEfficientLearning2009 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/14d26509-1c1c-4983-8f00-0c481fe918d5/","summary":"Gwern Branwen, (NO_ITEM_DATA:branwenSpacedRepetitionEfficientLearning2009)\nSummary On Spaced repetition.\nNotes My current favorite prosthesis is the class of software that exploits the spacing effect [Spacing effect]⁠, a centuries-old observation in cognitive psychology, to achieve results in studying or memorization much better than conventional student techniques; it is, alas, obscure⁠.\nThe spacing effect essentially says that if you have a question (\u0026ldquo;What is the fifth letter in this random sequence you learned?\u0026rdquo;), and you can only study it, say, 5 times, then your memory of the answer (\u0026rsquo;e\u0026rsquo;) will be strongest if you spread your 5 tries out over a long period of time - days, weeks, and months.","title":"Gwern Branwen | Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning"},{"content":" The forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time.

Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe solution to this is two-fold - learn to take breaks before being completely drained, so I can resist the default and take rejuvenating actions. And lower the activation energy of rejuvenating actions, to shape the default - making them as close to the default as possible.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been deliberately vague about exactly what to do, I expect this to vary a lot between people - I recommend brainstorming the things that you feel rejuvenated after doing and building a system such that doing those is the default. But, if it helps, this was my process:\nWhen brainstorming what rejuvenated me, I found that being outside, away from screens, and doing something that felt pleasant and virtuous was the best source of rejuvenation per unit time. And an easy way to do this was to go lie down in my garden for 10 minutes and read a physical book (which also meant I began to actually work my way through my to-read list!). And actually doing this initially had high activation energy - I needed to get up to walk to the garden, there was less of a dopamine rush than checking messages, etc. So, for a week, I made a policy of always doing this during breaks and ensured I stuck to it - locking my phone and blocking distracting websites during breaks, having brief pings at the start and end. And I shaped my environment to make it easier, making sure to always have my current book close to hand. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly stick to this, and it took some energy to do. But making it a habit significantly lowered the activation energy, and built positive associations with it, to the point that it now feels way easier. And I don\u0026rsquo;t stick to it religiously, but it\u0026rsquo;s now much easier to do when I feel tired.\n(Nanda n.d.)\nBibliography References Nanda, Neel. n.d. “Meaningful Rest.” Accessed May 23, 2021. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iYR9hKzTKGhZwTPWK/meaningful-rest.

There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \u0026ldquo;Morning, boys. How\u0026rsquo;s the water?\u0026rdquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \u0026ldquo;What the hell is water?\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you\u0026rsquo;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don\u0026rsquo;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.\nOf course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education\u0026rsquo;s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about \u0026ldquo;teaching you how to think.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re like me as a student, you\u0026rsquo;ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to get in a place like this isn\u0026rsquo;t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I\u0026rsquo;d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: \u0026ldquo;Look, it\u0026rsquo;s not like I don\u0026rsquo;t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I haven\u0026rsquo;t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out \u0026lsquo;Oh, God, if there is a God, I\u0026rsquo;m lost in this blizzard, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna die if you don\u0026rsquo;t help me.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. \u0026ldquo;Well then you must believe now,\u0026rdquo; he says, \u0026ldquo;After all, here you are, alive.\u0026rdquo; The atheist just rolls his eyes. \u0026ldquo;No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people\u0026rsquo;s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy\u0026rsquo;s interpretation is true and the other guy\u0026rsquo;s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person\u0026rsquo;s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there\u0026rsquo;s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They\u0026rsquo;re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists\u0026rsquo; problem is exactly the same as the story\u0026rsquo;s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know he\u0026rsquo;s locked up.\nThe point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.\nHere is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it\u0026rsquo;s so socially repulsive. But it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t worry that I\u0026rsquo;m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being \u0026ldquo;well-adjusted\u0026rdquo;, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.\nGiven the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education–least in my own case–is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about \u0026ldquo;the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.\u0026rdquo;\nThis, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.\nAnd I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let\u0026rsquo;s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what \u0026ldquo;day in day out\u0026rdquo; really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about.\nBy way of example, let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you\u0026rsquo;re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there\u0026rsquo;s no food at home. You haven\u0026rsquo;t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It\u0026rsquo;s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it\u0026rsquo;s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can\u0026rsquo;t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store\u0026rsquo;s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough check-out lanes open even though it\u0026rsquo;s the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can\u0026rsquo;t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.\nBut anyway, you finally get to the checkout line\u0026rsquo;s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to \u0026ldquo;Have a nice day\u0026rdquo; in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.\nEveryone here has done this, of course. But it hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet been part of you graduates\u0026rsquo; actual life routine, day after week after month after year.\nBut it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don\u0026rsquo;t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.\nOr, of course, if I\u0026rsquo;m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV\u0026rsquo;s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] — this is an example of how NOT to think, though — most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children\u0026rsquo;s children will despise us for wasting all the future\u0026rsquo;s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.\nYou get the idea.\nIf I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It\u0026rsquo;s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I\u0026rsquo;m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world\u0026rsquo;s priorities.\nThe thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible that some of these people in SUV\u0026rsquo;s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he\u0026rsquo;s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he\u0026rsquo;s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.\nOr I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket\u0026rsquo;s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.\nAgain, please don\u0026rsquo;t think that I\u0026rsquo;m giving you moral advice, or that I\u0026rsquo;m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it\u0026rsquo;s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to do it, or you just flat out won\u0026rsquo;t want to.\nBut most days, if you\u0026rsquo;re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s not usually like this. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you\u0026rsquo;re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won\u0026rsquo;t consider possibilities that aren\u0026rsquo;t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\nNot that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that\u0026rsquo;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you\u0026rsquo;re gonna try to see it.\nThis, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. You get to decide what to worship.\nBecause here\u0026rsquo;s something else that\u0026rsquo;s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It\u0026rsquo;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It\u0026rsquo;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.\nWorship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they\u0026rsquo;re evil or sinful, it\u0026rsquo;s that they\u0026rsquo;re unconscious. They are default settings.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nAnd the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving…. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\nThat is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.\nI know that this stuff probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don\u0026rsquo;t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.\nThe capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.\nIt is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:\n\u0026ldquo;This is water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is water.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.\nI wish you way more than luck.\nBibliography References David Foster Wallace. n.d. “This Is Water.” Accessed November 23, 2022. https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/.

Commoditizing the complements, in contrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small \u0026amp; lean, can often be accomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual property or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific layers without the \u0026ldquo;Big Bang\u0026rdquo; orientation of vertical integration and permitting \u0026ldquo;defeat in detail\u0026rdquo;, retains the general facade of competition, and ensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack where the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but is not itself at any risk.\nIn practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market dynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging competitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits \u0026amp; software patent trolling, proprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate incompatibility or \u0026ldquo;embrace and extend\u0026rdquo;, FUD, operating at a loss indefinitely, etc. (\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s An App For That\u0026rdquo; is why you buy an iPhone—but it\u0026rsquo;s Apple with the $930 billion market cap \u0026amp; not the app developers.)\nDone correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents\u0026rsquo; long-term control of markets \u0026amp; justifies their enormous valuations—by definition, the competitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too numerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening R\u0026amp;D4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be relatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor does this require convoluted explanations like \u0026ldquo;they are pretending to not be monopolists\u0026rdquo; or fully general unfalsifiable claims like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s good PR\u0026rdquo; for why big companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects like new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts \u0026amp; TrueType itself) or open source TCP/​IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly profitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable—but do have clear explanations in terms of business objectives like \u0026ldquo;driving more mobile web browsing\u0026rdquo; (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement, mobile web browsing, has become cheaper/​easier). I wonder if this also explains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes—as entities get worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but was formerly considered \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; or because they assume the other entity knows something they don\u0026rsquo;t.

Striving to adopt a schedule that significantly reduces the amount of sleep per 24 hours and/or fragments sleep into multiple episodes throughout the 24-hour day is not recommended.\nThoughts Their findings align with my experience.\nNotes Abstract Polyphasic sleep is the practice of distributing multiple short sleep episodes across the 24-hour day rather than having one major and possibly a minor (\u0026ldquo;nap\u0026rdquo;) sleep episode each day. While the prevalence of polyphasic sleep is unknown, anecdotal reports suggest attempts to follow this practice are common, particularly among young adults. Polyphasic-sleep advocates claim to thrive on as little as 2 hours of total sleep per day. However, significant concerns have been raised that polyphasic sleep schedules can result in health and safety consequences. We reviewed the literature to identify the impact of polyphasic sleep schedules (excluding nap or siesta schedules) on health, safety, and performance outcomes. Of 40,672 potentially relevant publications, with 2,023 selected for full-text review, 22 relevant papers were retained. We found no evidence supporting benefits from following polyphasic sleep schedules. Based on the current evidence, the consensus opinion is that polyphasic sleep schedules, and the sleep deficiency inherent in those schedules, are associated with a variety of adverse physical health, mental health, and performance outcomes. Striving to adopt a schedule that significantly reduces the amount of sleep per 24 hours and/or fragments sleep into multiple episodes throughout the 24-hour day is not recommended.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:weaverAdverseImpactPolyphasicSleepPatternsHumansReportNationalSleepFoundation2021 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/018f9541-56d8-4091-8ac8-a8ebf61060d9/","summary":"(NO_ITEM_DATA:weaverAdverseImpactPolyphasicSleepPatternsHumansReportNationalSleepFoundation2021)\nSummary Based on the current evidence, the consensus opinion is that polyphasic sleep schedules, and the sleep deficiency inherent in those schedules, are associated with a variety of adverse physical health, mental health, and performance outcomes.

Mostly plants. I like it because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get you 90% of the way there 90% of the time.\nWrite code Not too much Just be aware of your project\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;appetite\u0026rdquo;: write what needs to be written, and then try not to over-indulge.\nMostly functions By \u0026ldquo;functions\u0026rdquo; here I mean \u0026ldquo;Pure functions\u0026rdquo;. You could make a case that pure functions aren\u0026rsquo;t the \u0026ldquo;plants\u0026rdquo; of code, though I feel that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly always a win for the long-term health of the project.\nOf course the qualifier is \u0026ldquo;mostly\u0026rdquo;: this isn\u0026rsquo;t a dogma. Writing a 100% functional system (\u0026ldquo;going vegan\u0026rdquo;, if you will) often requires you to jump through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not be worth it.\nAnd then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or performance-sensitivity. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.\n\u0026ldquo;Real code\u0026rdquo; Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:\n\u0026ldquo;He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother\u0026rsquo;s generation would have recognized as food.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is \u0026ldquo;code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what they do\u0026rdquo;. Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don\u0026rsquo;t get too clever, \u0026ldquo;manufacturing artificial ingredients\u0026rdquo;. Use the primitives that are there, when possible.

Scott | Seeing like a State ","title":"James Scott"},{"content":"Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)\nSummary Legibility as singular: Overriding all other ways of being and forcing us to live within the mind of its creator. Legibility as faceted: Complements our own experience; allows us to apply it where we see fit Thoughts This dichotomy reminds me of Unix philosophy; Composability versus monolithic design.\nNotes In Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; [Legibility] as something a state imposes on its people and resources. It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.\nOne of Scott\u0026rsquo;s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests. These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.\nAnd so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps. A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand. If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it. Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.\nIn The Image of the City, Kevin Lynch defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it. It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.\nLynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they\u0026rsquo;d navigate from one part of the city to another. He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.\nIn software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software. [Not in Emacs!]\nThis is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s continuous attempts to resurrect logical positivism (a). Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles. As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.\nScott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they\u0026rsquo;re mostly process-oriented (\u0026ldquo;take small steps\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;favor reversibility\u0026rdquo;) and entirely focused on harm reduction. For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.\nThe legibility described in Seeing Like a State, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is singular; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator. The legibility described in Image of the City, and offered by Marco Polo, is faceted; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.\nCreating singular legibility is simple: find something that\u0026rsquo;s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it. What\u0026rsquo;s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you\u0026rsquo;d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.\nFaceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively. It\u0026rsquo;s not, however, something we can simply create on our own. Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.\nBut if you, like me, are interested in software, there are no readymade references.5 I believe, however, that the answer lies in articulation points:\nAs we compose our abstractions, we must ensure we create, at regular intervals, interfaces which fully separate our upstream and downstream components. These interfaces not only delineate subgraphs which can be understood in isolation [Black boxes], they represent decision points in our design process. From any given articulation point, we can branch off in a dozen different directions, perhaps even all at once. These are separate interpretations of what the interface represents, each of which can be considered or ignored in isolation.\nThis is more easily said than done. Countless decisions go into every bit of software, but not all of them deserve to be enshrined as an interface. Once used, interfaces ossify. They allow the code on either side to drift apart, to lose consistency in idiom and purpose. If we don\u0026rsquo;t expect an interface to require multiple interpretations, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist. To make the right decision, we must predict the future.\nBibliography References Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Two Concepts of Legibility.” Accessed November 11, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/two-concepts-of-legibility.html.

Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object\u0026rsquo;s velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \u0026ldquo;instantaneous rate of change\u0026rdquo;, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe process of finding a derivative is called differentiation [Differentiation]. The reverse process is called antidifferentiation [Antiderivative]. The fundamental theorem of calculus [Fundamental theorem of calculus] relates antidifferentiation with integration [Integration]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.\n(“Derivative” 2022)\nGeometric interpretation of derivatives \\(f\u0026rsquo;(x)\\) is the slope of the tangent line of \\(f(x)\\).\nFinding Maxima and minima with differentiation The Global minima of \\(y = x^2 + 4x - 5\\) is at \\(y=-2\\). To solve:\nFind the Extrema\n$$\n\\begin{align} y \u0026amp;= x^2 + 4x - 5 \\\\ \\frac{dy}{dx} \u0026amp;= 2x + 4 \\\\ \\end{align}\n$$\nNow equate to zero\u0026hellip;\n$$\n\\begin{align} 0 \u0026amp;= 2x + 4 \\\\ x \u0026amp;= \\frac{-4}{2} \\\\ x \u0026amp;= -2 \\end{align}\n$$\nDetermine maxima or minima\n$$\n\\begin{align} y \u0026amp;= x^2 + 4x - 5 \\\\ \\frac{d^2y}{(dx)^2} \u0026amp;= 2 \\end{align}\n$$\nThe slope of the slope is positive (\\(2 \u0026gt; 0\\)), so the Extrema is a Global minima.\nAnother example with a higher Degree: \\(f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 8x + 1\\)\n$$\n\\begin{align} f(x) \u0026amp;= \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 1 \\\\ f\u0026rsquo;(x) \u0026amp;= 4x^2 + 2x - 5 \\end{align}\n$$\nThis has two solutions by the Quadratic formula:\n\\(x = -\\frac{1}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{4}\\)\nYou can perform the second step from above to determine whether these are maxima or minima.\nExpand Related: Differential calculus (“Derivative” 2022)\nBibliography References “Derivative.” 2022.

In a large skillet, heat a glug of oil or veggie broth over medium. When the pan is hot, add the garlic and sauté until it becomes fragrant. This will take about a minute. Add the mushrooms, tamari, and thyme. Cook, stirring every minute or so, for 6 to 8 minutes or until the mushrooms release their water and a little broth starts to form. Combine the cashews and veggie broth in a high-speed blender and blend until the mixture is completely smooth. This might take up to 5 minutes, depending on the speed and power of your blender. Pour the cashew sauce into the pan with the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for a couple minutes to let the sauce thicken, stirring frequently. Throw in the spinach and stir for another minute. Spread a third of the marinara sauce on the bottom of an 8-by-11-inch baking dish. Add a layer of uncooked noodles. Cover the noodles with half of the mushroom cream. Add a layer of noodles. Use another third of the marinara to cover these noodles. Add the remaining mushroom cream. Add the last layer of noodles and cover it with the remaining marinara sauce. Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, add a sprinkle of nutritional yeast over the top, if you like, and bake for another 15 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation. A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need. A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders\u0026rsquo; priorities, and people\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the problem and its solution. (“Agile Software Development” 2022)\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:\nCustomer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months). Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location). Working software is the primary measure of progress. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives.\nBecause your pipe has only one faucet, there\u0026rsquo;s no shortcut to achieving clarity other than first emptying the wastewater.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s apply this to creativity: At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that unavoidably comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting them, recognize bad ideas as progress. Bad ideas are usually the clichés your brain has been overexposed to.\nOnce the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my guess as to why: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve generated enough bad output, your mind reflexively identifies which elements caused the badness. Then it becomes good at avoiding them. You start pattern-matching interesting ideas with greater intuition.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to look at something bad then intuit how to make it better than to make something good out of thin air.\nMost creators resist their bad ideas and never reach the clear water.

In other words, \u0026ldquo;your third place is where you relax in public, where you encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances.\u0026rdquo;\nOther scholars have summarized Oldenburg\u0026rsquo;s view of a third place with eight characteristics:\nNeutral ground\nOccupants of third places have little to no obligation to be there. They are not tied down to the area financially, politically, legally, or otherwise and are free to come and go as they please.\nLeveler (a leveling place)\nThird places put no importance on an individual\u0026rsquo;s status in a society. One\u0026rsquo;s socioeconomic status does not matter in a third place, allowing for a sense of commonality among its occupants. There are no prerequisites or requirements that would prevent acceptance or participation in the third place.\nConversation is the main activity\nPlayful and happy conversation is the main focus of activity in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of conversation is usually light-hearted and humorous; wit and good-natured playfulness are highly valued.\nAccessibility and accommodation\nThird places must be open and readily accessible to those who occupy them. They must also be accommodating, meaning they provide for the wants of their inhabitants, and all occupants feel their needs have been fulfilled.\nThe regulars\nThird places harbor a number of regulars that help give the space its tone, and help set the mood and characteristics of the area. Regulars to third places also attract newcomers, and are there to help someone new to the space feel welcome and accommodated.\nA low profile\nThird places are characteristically wholesome. The inside of a third place is without extravagance or grandiosity, and has a homely feel. Third places are never snobby or pretentious, and are accepting of all types of individuals, from various different walks of life.\nThe mood is playful\nThe tone of conversation in third places is never marked with tension or hostility. Instead, third places have a playful nature, where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common, but highly valued.\nA home away from home\nOccupants of third places will often have the same feelings of warmth, possession, and belonging as they would in their own homes. They feel a piece of themselves is rooted in the space, and gain spiritual regeneration by spending time there.\n(“Third Place” 2022)\nBibliography References “Third Place.” 2022.

Human evolution has primarily occurred in small hunter-gatherer groups, as opposed to in larger and more recently settled agricultural societies or civilizations. With a negative connotation and in a political context, tribalism can also mean discriminatory behavior or attitudes towards out-groups, based on in-group loyalty.\n(“Tribalism” 2022)\nTribalism or Coalitional Instincts is closely connected to the concept of in/out-groups. Coalitional instincts drive humans to act in ways which cause them join, support, defend, and maintain their membership in various coalitions that are defined by sharing a common identity.\n(Lesswrong n.d.)\nEvery human—not excepting scientists—bears the whole stamp of the human condition. This includes evolved neural programs specialized for navigating the world of coalitions—teams, not groups. (Although the concept of coalitional instincts has emerged over recent decades, there is no mutually-agreed-upon term for this concept yet.) These programs enable us and induce us to form, maintain, join, support, recognize, defend, defect from, factionalize, exploit, resist, subordinate, distrust, dislike, oppose, and attack coalitions. Coalitions are sets of individuals interpreted by their members and/or by others as sharing a common abstract identity (including propensities to act as a unit, to defend joint interests, and to have shared mental states and other properties of a single human agent, such as status and prerogatives).\nWhy do we see the world this way? Most species do not and cannot. Even those that have linear hierarchies do not. Among elephant seals, for example, an alpha can reproductively exclude other males, even though beta and gamma are physically capable of beating alpha—if only they could cognitively coordinate. The fitness payoff is enormous for solving the thorny array of cognitive and motivational computational problems inherent in acting in groups: Two can beat one, three can beat two, and so on, propelling an arms race of numbers, effective mobilization, coordination, and cohesion.\nAncestrally, evolving the neural code to crack these problems supercharged the ability to successfully compete for access to reproductively limiting resources. Fatefully, we are descended solely from those better equipped with coalitional instincts. In this new world, power shifted from solitary alphas to the effectively coordinated down-alphabet, giving rise to a new, larger landscape of political threat and opportunity: rival groups or factions expanding at your expense or shrinking as a result of your dominance.\n(Tooby n.d.)\nBibliography References Lesswrong. n.d. “Tribalism.” Accessed January 14, 2023. https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/tribalism.

Apple didn\u0026rsquo;t just make an \u0026ldquo;interoperable\u0026rdquo; product that worked with an existing product in the market: they made an adversarially interoperable product whose compatibility was wrested from the incumbent, through diligent reverse-engineering and reimplementation. What\u0026rsquo;s more, Apple committed to maintaining that interoperability, even though Microsoft continued to update its products in ways that temporarily undermined the ability of Apple customers to exchange documents with Microsoft customers, paying engineers to unbreak everything that Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s maneuvers broke. Apple\u0026rsquo;s persistence paid off: over time, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s customers became dependent on compatibility with Apple customers, and they would complain if Microsoft changed its Office products in ways that broke their cross-platform workflow.\nSince Pages\u0026rsquo; launch, document interoperability has stabilized, with multiple parties entering the market, including Google\u0026rsquo;s cloud-based Docs offerings, and the free/open alternatives from LibreOffice. The convergence on this standard was not undertaken with the blessing of the dominant player: rather, it came about despite Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s opposition.

The stag hunt problem originated with philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on Inequality. In Rousseau\u0026rsquo;s telling, two hunters must decide separately, and without the other knowing, whether to hunt a stag or a hare. However, both hunters know the only way to successfully hunt a stag is with the other\u0026rsquo;s help. One hunter can catch a hare alone with less effort and less time, but it is worth far less than a stag and has much less meat. Rousseau therefore posits it would be much better for each hunter, acting individually, to give up total autonomy and minimal risk, which brings only the small reward of the hare. Instead, each hunter should separately choose the more ambitious and far more rewarding goal of getting the stag, thereby giving up some autonomy in exchange for the other hunter\u0026rsquo;s cooperation and added might.\n(“Stag Hunt” 2022)\nSee also: Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma.\nExamples Social cooperation; international agreements regarding climate change Bibliography References “Stag Hunt.” 2022.

Discard the water covering the dough and fill the bowl again with cool, clean water. As the new water fills the bowl, begin stretching and kneading the dough. Keeping your hands and dough in the bowl of water, continue kneading and stretching until the water becomes very opaque.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\nDump out your milky water, using a colander to catch the dough ball and any stray pieces\nCover your dough ball again, this time using luke-warm water, and continue to stretch and knead until the water becomes opaque again. Alternating cool and warm water affects how the dough breaks apart and comes back together again. The goal of this is to hopefully lessen the amount of times you need to wash. However, you can do all cool water and get the same result. It is not recommended to use water that is too warm or hot, because your dough can become stickier or more gluey and harder to work with.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\nRepeat steps 3 and 4\n(Le 2021)\nYou will likely need to repeat this process at least few times. You will see the dough begin to look more stringy and feel a little \u0026ldquo;squeaky\u0026rdquo; between your fingers. The more starch you wash out, the more chewy your seitan will become, so the end result is up to you.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWash until the water is at least a little bit cloudy.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\nOnce you have finished washing to your desired level of water clarity, let the dough rest in the colander for at least 20 minutes\nThis is to both drain the excess water and let the strands begin to develop. If you are adding additional spices or proteins, proceed to step [7]. If you are not, you should let it rest even longer until the gluten becomes very elastic and you are able to stretch it far without it breaking.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n(optional) Add in seasonings\nA good rule of thumb if adding proteins or liquids is to only add about 2oz to this size dough ball so your seitan does not become too soft. I prefer just adding in dry spices to keep the texture chewier, but you can also add liquids such as soy sauce or liquid smoke to boost flavor, and/or additional proteins such as tofu or beans to soften the texture of your final result and also make your seitan a complete protein. My preferred method for incorporating them is to use a food processor, but you can also cut them into the dough or knead them in by hand. Then you will need to let the dough rest again until it starts to come back together and become more elastic and stretchy. You want it strong enough to knot, even if you do not intend to cook it that way. This usually takes about 20 minutes, but can take up to an hour or so depending on what you\u0026rsquo;ve added. You can also leave it sit overnight so the gluten continues to develop, but that is unnecessary.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\nPrepare Seitan for cooking\nStretch and knot (braid) the Seitan dough.\n(Le 2021)\nCook Seitan\nBring enough broth to cover Seitan to a simmer in a pot, then add the Seitan and cook for 2+ hours (depending on the thickness of the dough).\nLet it rest in the fridge for at least 8 hours\nWhile you can skip this step, the texture will not have had a chance to completely firm up.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\nBibliography References Le, Lisa. 2021. “Washed Flour Seitan Method.” The Viet Vegan.

This applies to more than just racism and is termed the cost of doing business.\nNotes [\u0026hellip;] controversy = attention and attention = brand recognition. [\u0026hellip;] [The] economy runs on engagement, and hate-clicks are still clicks.\nThis is privilege. Indeed, this is part of what makes privilege privilege: it\u0026rsquo;s the identity that\u0026rsquo;s treated as a norm. The one you don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about.\nThe Alt-Right is the gentrification of white nationalism. Their pocket squares and MBAs and $90 haircuts short out the white moderate\u0026rsquo;s brain because they still associate white supremacy with white trash.\nThe boundaries are not policed from the inside.\nNow, these people frequently are self-identified, card-carrying racists. My point is, for this system of incentives and rewards to operate, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Any of them may, but none of them must. Racism exists and it\u0026rsquo;s efficient. And, in a capitalist society, where cops are competing for promotions, private prisons are competing for contracts, and politicians are competing for votes, if an unethical behavior sees a higher return than the alternative… then ethics are a luxury. There are hundreds of examples of businesses that claim, in periods of prosperity, that they prefer to do what is right over what is profitable. But what tune do they play when prosperity ends? Every boom has a bust - since 1900, the US has spent one out of every four years in recession. And, in the lean season, not using this generations-old system built by white people to advantage their descendents is a liability. A values-based business typically goes one of three ways: compromising their values to stay competitive, getting bought by someone who compromised their values to stay competitive, or sticking to their guns and facing a higher risk of going out of business. Many choose to do the right thing, and some even survive. But that\u0026rsquo;s beating the odds. The market trends toward the optimal strategy.\nSee also:\nSpecifically: Moloch and This is the dreamtime Generally: Systems [\u0026hellip;] white supremacy is about power.\nBecause, I mean, what if they genuinely believe the Voting Rights Act unfairly targets Southern states? Or even if - and I\u0026rsquo;m saying if here - they did do it to suppress votes, if hurting Black people isn\u0026rsquo;t their goal, and they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to win elections, is that really \u0026ldquo;racist?\u0026rdquo;\nModerates are very cagey about breaking out the R-word for a fellow white person.\nSee, there\u0026rsquo;s this other definition of racism that most white people learn in grade school: racism is when you say mean things to other kids about skin color and it hurts their feelings; racism is about cruelty. And harm done by white people, therefore, isn\u0026rsquo;t racism if isn\u0026rsquo;t cruel; it\u0026rsquo;s merely ignorant. Or apathetic. But ignorance and apathy can be reasoned with; you just gotta sit down and hash it out. As long as it takes. Real white supremacy is about emotional distress or interpersonal violence; it\u0026rsquo;s uncommon, it\u0026rsquo;s unpopular, and it\u0026rsquo;s a hearts and minds issue.\nWhat this definition leaves out is any notion that white supremacy is about power. That white people who disavow racism still live longer, get paid better, get arrested less often, and are typically in position to negotiate with whomever\u0026rsquo;s in power. That this society was built for The Everyman, and being The Everyman confers power upon you.\nWhen children of white moderates get older and first brush up against this definition, wherein white supremacy is not small but all-encompassing, where it can be cruel, but is at least as often indifferent, and where every white person in the country is bound up in it and privileged by it whether they want to be or not, and will never, ever experience it themselves - where it\u0026rsquo;s not about feelings but power - how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition I grew up with was simplified for 9-year-olds\u0026rdquo;?; or, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition given to me by white grown-ups was less complete than the one a Black grown-up might\u0026rsquo;ve given\u0026rdquo;? And how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t just redefine racism?\u0026rdquo;\nRight out the gate, the white moderate is possessive not just of their whiteness but of the very definition of racism.\nIn the definition they know, racism exists only over here. And the white collaborator is a compatriot who shares their ultimate vision for the future, but has simply gone off course somewhere. And they don\u0026rsquo;t see themselves as flawed individuals with a long way still to go; they\u0026rsquo;ve already arrived! They\u0026rsquo;re the destination everyone else needs to get to! Living proof that white supremacy can be easily and painlessly opted out of. They can\u0026rsquo;t see collaborators as opponents because there is no definition of white supremacy that includes collaborators and doesn\u0026rsquo;t also include them.\nAnd this is critically important: they don\u0026rsquo;t want to start thinking of themselves as white. They don\u0026rsquo;t want the constant awareness of one\u0026rsquo;s race or how one\u0026rsquo;s race is perceived – you know, the things the rest of humanity deals with. And who would want that? I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who wants that: Nazis and klansmen want that. They\u0026rsquo;re the only ones who like thinking about whiteness every day. So, white moderates cling to the other definition, the comfortable one. They may be more or less willing to collaborate with people of color, but mostly in ways that don\u0026rsquo;t foreground their whiteness. White-as-default is one concession that can never be made, in part because it\u0026rsquo;s the one that can\u0026rsquo;t be spoken.\nRacism must be understood as more than a set of individual beliefs and feelings, but as a tool for achieving political ends, first and foremost because claiming otherwise is both factually and morally wrong. But also, without this understanding, white culture can\u0026rsquo;t recognize the stakes.\nThe fascist goal is to harness and redirect class resentment towards a scapegoat.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t care about ideas. They care about power.\nSee Realpolitik, Power politics, Moloch.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2022. “The Cost of Doing Business.” Tumblr.

The B-tree generalizes the Binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. Unlike other Self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\n((Programiz n.d.))\nEach internal node of a B-tree contains a number of keys. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) [(e.g. \\(30\\) and \\(33\\) in the image above)]. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than \\(a_1\\), all values in the middle subtree will be between \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than \\(a_2\\).\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\nProperties For a given B-tree of order \\(m\\):\nEach Vertex has at most \\(m\\) children The root has at least two children unless it\u0026rsquo;s a leaf Internal (non-leaf) Vertices store: Pointers to child Vertices Keys which indicate the bounds of the elements in the leaves below. Internal Vertices have between \\(\\lceil m/2 \\rceil\\) and \\(m\\) children Internal Vertices with \\(k\\) children have \\(k - 1\\) keys Leaf Vertices store data Leaf Vertices are all on the same level Operations Lookup Lookup in a B-tree is straightforward. Given a node to start from, we use a simple linear or binary search to find whether the desired element is in the node, or if not, which child pointer to follow from the current node.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\nTime complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nInsertion Insertion and deletion from a B-tree are more complicated; in fact, they are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. For insertion, we first find the appropriate leaf node into which the inserted element falls (assuming it is not already in the tree). If there is already room in the node, the new element can be inserted simply. Otherwise the current leaf is already full and must be split into two leaves, one of which acquires the new element. The parent is then updated to contain a new key and child pointer. If the parent is already full, the process ripples upwards, eventually possibly reaching the root. If the root is split into two, then a new root is created with just two children, increasing the height of the tree by one.\nFor example, here is the effect of a series of insertions. The first insertion (13) merely affects a leaf. The second insertion (14) overflows the leaf and adds a key to an internal node. The third insertion propagates all the way to the root.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n((“B-Trees” n.d.))\n((“Insertion into a B-tree” n.d.))\nTime complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nDeletion Deletion works in the opposite way: the element is removed from the leaf. If the leaf becomes empty, a key is removed from the parent node. If that breaks invariant 3, the keys of the parent node and its immediate right (or left) sibling are reapportioned among them so that invariant 3 is satisfied. If this is not possible, the parent node can be combined with that sibling, removing a key another level up in the tree and possible causing a ripple all the way to the root. If the root has just two children, and they are combined, then the root is deleted and the new combined node becomes the root of the tree, reducing the height of the tree by one.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\nTime complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nBibliography References “B-Tree.” 2022.

So every three, four years, five years, the President of the United States, going back to since before I was born, they visit Saudi Arabia and they codify a long existing geopolitical relationship in the Middle East. Namely, a few things which we\u0026rsquo;ll go over, which is the US support of Saudi\u0026rsquo;s bombing in Yemen, which is seen as a quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;counter measure\u0026rdquo; against quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;expansionist\u0026rdquo; Iran.

So this is sort of similar to that where there\u0026rsquo;s this clergy class of reporters who needed to explain why the fist bump was not bad but because, my favorite was Peter Baker — who is the biggest fucking hack in the world — who\u0026rsquo;s a foreign policy for The New York Times wrote, quote, \u0026ldquo;As soon as Biden got out of the car and saw MBS waiting, he immediately put his fist out making clear it would not be a handshake.\u0026rdquo; This is followed by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard who said, quote, \u0026ldquo;A chilly fist bump with M.B.S. welcomes Biden.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Right.\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly,\u0026rdquo; see Adam.\nAdam: A \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nNima: They\u0026rsquo;re not friends, it was a \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nAdam: Right. And so then you get into this whole thing where everyone\u0026rsquo;s debating whether or not this, you know, about the fist bump, the optics, you know, cozying up to dictators, human rights, that\u0026rsquo;s all bullshit.\nNima: As if the decades long relationship, which is clear as fucking day, is not the actual story here.\nAdam: Right and so the fist bump becomes a distraction in a sense, right? It becomes a way of, then the crime is not the selling of the $650 million in arms.\nNima: Right. Then we\u0026rsquo;re just reading fucking tea leaves instead of talking about the real issue.\nAdam: Right. And so the big crime really should be the month-long Washington Post investigation, that came out on June 4 of this year, detailing how despite the fact that Biden claimed he was going to end the war in Yemen to much fanfare when he first came in office — obviously, on this show, we said that\u0026rsquo;s probably bullshit, turns out total bullshit — the US has been continuing to support the Saudi bombing of Yemen to this day since Biden\u0026rsquo;s office. So the crime is not that we\u0026rsquo;re supporting their war on Yemen or supporting the blockade of Yemen, although we sort of speak in platitudes about ceasefires and lifting blockades. Fundamentally, they\u0026rsquo;re still giving intelligence support, replacing parts, et cetera. Literally pointing to a map saying this is where you want to, you know, this is where the Houthi rebels are or whatever. The US obviously sells them hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons. None of that\u0026rsquo;s changed. Then there\u0026rsquo;s this whole narrative that, \u0026lsquo;Oh, he had to do it because of Ukraine.\u0026rsquo; There was a Bloomberg headline that read, \u0026ldquo;Soaring Oil Prices Forced Biden to Engage with Saudis He\u0026rsquo;d Spurned.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Again, remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not that Biden fundamentally as President of the United States is fine with the relationship with Saudi Arabia because it\u0026rsquo;s an absolutely critical relationship to what US foreign policy is and has been for decades. Biden does not have a problem with this. He is not hand wringing about this. He is not concerned with meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. This is not an issue and yet our media needs it to be this twisted, tough decision to make.\nAdam: So from June 3, 2020, \u0026ldquo;Biden forced into Saudi thaw amid rising oil prices.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Meeting with Crown Prince would cement U-turn for a US president who labeled kingdom a \u0026lsquo;pariah.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Financial Times — not a U turn at all. Fundamentally, policy never changed.\nNima: Right. Labeling a pariah but doing nothing to create pariah status is not actually making a pariah.\nAdam: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;The president\u0026rsquo;s Middle East reset raises human rights concerns for some fellow Democrats. Others are prepared to get pragmatic.\u0026rdquo; So —\nNima: Oh, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s a really good one.\nAdam: Pragmatic.\nNima: Human rights concerns: niche issue. Pragmatism: reality.\nAdam: So every single time we do this we get the same hand wringing concerns and part of me is just kind of frustrated by this because I\u0026rsquo;m like, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this theater? What\u0026rsquo;s the point at this point, in the year of our Lord, Ken Roth has been the head of Human Rights Watch for going on, you know, 35 years or going on 30 years now, right? You\u0026rsquo;d think after Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, Biden all did the exact same trip, they greenlit the exact same weapons deals, they have soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia who then left but then sort of came back. You have the US selling every single Gulf despot from Kuwait to UAE to Saudi Arabia the same spy technology so they can spy on dissidents and lock them up. You have these very cozy business relationships between Saudi Arabia funds Vice media, UAE funds CNN, you would think after these decades of relationships that this is not something that deviates from quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;abandoning principles,\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s actually the principle itself and that once you shred that pretense, again, what replaces it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, might makes right nihilism or kind of Kissinger view of the world about power1, it should be okay, well, what would a government that actually cares about human rights both negative and positive, right? Not just freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, but freedom from poverty, freedom for education, freedom for housing.\nAdam: Right. What would that regime look like and is that something we could maybe pressure our government to do or fight for? The sort of classic critique of this arrangement is that allied states, the United States and allied states, are viewed as being, when they commit human rights violations, it\u0026rsquo;s seen as a deviation whereas when human rights are committed by enemy states, they\u0026rsquo;re existential to who they are.\nNima: Right. Fundamental to what those states are all about. They only understand power, they don\u0026rsquo;t care about their people, that\u0026rsquo;s all the stuff that we\u0026rsquo;ve that about on the show like about what these kinds of countries elsewhere deemed to be official US state enemies. They are fundamentally bad and we are fundamentally good.\nAdam: Right and we just deviate. Yeah, we need a mild talking to, we need a mild chiding. And so a very infamous version of this was in January of 2015 when King Abdullah died, this is again this sort of worst of the worst human rights violators, this is before the war in Yemen started but we\u0026rsquo;re talking, you know, women can\u0026rsquo;t drive, chopping up dissenters, mass beheadings, oppressive Shia religious intolerance, blah, blah, blah, you name it, they got it, a lot of connections to al Qaeda, which we\u0026rsquo;ll table for another episode. Yeah, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Saudi Arabia: King\u0026rsquo;s Reform Agenda Unfulfilled,\u0026rdquo; and the article said, quote:\nKing Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s reign brought about marginal advances for women but failed to secure the fundamental rights of Saudi citizens to free expression, association, and assembly. Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s successor, King Salman, should halt persecution of peaceful dissidents and religious minorities…\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, his reform agenda was unfulfilled, right? And contrast this with Hugo Chavez who died about 21 months prior, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Venezuela: Chavez\u0026rsquo;s Authoritarian Legacy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Dramatic Concentration of Power and Open Disregard for Basic Human Rights.\u0026rdquo; Throughout the obituary of Chavez he\u0026rsquo;s seen as existential to the regime as human rights abuses whereas Saudi Arabia remains, even though of course, they commit hundreds and hundreds of more human rights abuses than Chavez ever did, Saudi Arabia is seen as having a reform, unironically, said to have a reform agenda, which was simply unfulfilled.\nNima: Reform agenda. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t get to be completed, because the noble reformist died. Oops.\nAdam: Yeah, their dog ate the reform agenda so they had to sort of write it again, it was a whole thing. I mean, this whole thing is so, you realize again, just after years and years and years of this kind of discourse how empty it is, how much it\u0026rsquo;s meant to sort of limit the conversation.\n[links and footnotes added]\nAdam: Would any New York Times reporter without irony say that scholars of the Middle East claim that it\u0026rsquo;s best that Russia align with Iran and Syria? Because that\u0026rsquo;ll promote good behavior, dissuade, no, you would be laughed out of the room if you said that. But this goofy, childish bullshit that has absolutely no empirical basis, is based on a bunch of racist assumptions, that somehow the US is the human rights Boys and Girls Club, is going to be your mentor, it\u0026rsquo;s going to look after you, it\u0026rsquo;s just going to look after these otherwise kind of restless young countries, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to, we\u0026rsquo;re going to guide them to the right path? What the fuck is that? After school special? Saudi Arabia knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, we know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, they\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the same thing for decades, they serve a very specific function, and this idea that we\u0026rsquo;re going to change them from the inside. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the height of cynicism and Ben Hubbard is just a total fucking White House flunky, he\u0026rsquo;s a total national security state flunky, is going to just kind of seeing how many the sophistic little ratchet pellets he can shove in his article to so liberals can go, \u0026lsquo;Yeah, well, I guess he\u0026rsquo;s right, I guess we have no choice.\u0026rsquo; So all that hemming and hawing and huffing and puffing over Trump patting dictators on the back and going to Saudi Arabia and doing this, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026lsquo;I guess that this is somehow different than that.\u0026rsquo; Well, no, it\u0026rsquo;s not different. Oh, because he did it with a heavy fucking heart.\nNima: Well, because see, this goes back to that sophistry, right? This goes back to the fucking sophistry, Adam, which is Trump did it because he fundamentally agreed with them and he wanted to be like them and he was impressed by dictators, right? But Biden, Biden does it because he just, ah, it\u0026rsquo;s such a bummer, he\u0026rsquo;s so forced, he\u0026rsquo;s going to, he\u0026rsquo;s going to be forced to give a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump\u0026rdquo; as opposed to —\nAdam: Oh, a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Right. Here\u0026rsquo;s a chilly fist bump along with your $650 million worth of weapons.\nNima: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Cut Biden some slack. U.S. presidents have to deal with dictators.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the headline, and in it, Max Boot argues, of course, what you would think which is, you know, hey, this is the way Realpolitik is executed, why is everyone getting so up in arms about this? In the article he writes this, quote:\n\u0026ldquo;In truth, MBS is a more ambivalent figure than the cartoon villain that he is so often made out to be in media coverage. It\u0026rsquo;s true that he is cruel and repressive. He has created a climate of fear in Saudi Arabia, imprisoned dissidents and accumulated absolute power. But, while illiberal politically, he is liberalizing Saudi society.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Yeah, which he\u0026rsquo;s not, whatever, he\u0026rsquo;s been doing the same reform agenda for, you know, the 250 year Saudi Foreign reform agenda.\nNima: The long game.\nAdam: It\u0026rsquo;ll be ready when my great-great grandson.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. \u0026ldquo;Tourists are welcome for the first time,\u0026rdquo; he writes. \u0026ldquo;Theaters and concerts have been opened.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Oh, theaters and concerts. Okay.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right.\nAdam: Yeah. Lord knows that that\u0026rsquo;s the mark of a liberal democracy is bread and circuses that historically —\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. And meanwhile, The Washington Post is publishing this and Jamal Khashoggi, again, who was bone sawed alive by the MBS regime, by, you know, guys carrying this fucking shit out, that is the same outlet that is publishing this shit for Max Boot justifying it.\nAdam: Max Boot argues on Twitter that Nixon met with Mao Zedong, FDR met with Stalin blah, blah, blah, and it\u0026rsquo;s like, look, it\u0026rsquo;s true, I actually think that all the anger about the fist bump is a distraction. It\u0026rsquo;s not really the problem.\nNima: Right. The meeting is not the issue. That could be diplomacy. He\u0026rsquo;s not meeting MBS for diplomatic reasons.\nAdam: Right. He\u0026rsquo;s meeting with him to talk about increasing the weapons sales that we, the substance of the relationship is the problem, which is supporting and backing the subjugation of dissidents, the bombing of Yemeni, the oppression of women, I mean, you name it, right? The support for sectarianism in the region, blah, blah, blah, which again, I think has geopolitical function for US and Israel. It\u0026rsquo;s not the actual fist bump.\nNima: The lie is that Biden is meeting with an enemy. He\u0026rsquo;s not.\n[links added]\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:citationsneededNewsBriefBidenDictatorTourTediumOurHumanRightsConcerns2022a Betty Miller Unterberger | Power Politics and Statecraft: The World According to Kissinger\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/86e4a35a-4b5e-4403-946b-737b4dad1693/","summary":"Citations Needed, (NO_ITEM_DATA:citationsneededNewsBriefBidenDictatorTourTediumOurHumanRightsConcerns2022a)\nSummary Media Spin regarding President Biden\u0026rsquo;s visit to Saudi Arabia and meeting with Mohammed bin Salman as reluctantly performed or as a necessary evil Carry water for the underlying (Realpolitik) truth: Biden, and United States foreign policy in general dating back to well before Biden, engage willingly with Saudi Arabia.

Backlinks Upstream | Fully Automated Luxury Communism ","title":"Upstream"},{"content":"Upstream, (NO_ITEM_DATA:upstreamFullyAutomatedLuxuryCommunism2022)\nSummary A discussion of Fully automated luxury communism.\nNotes [Della Z Duncan]\nAnd so what about this term, Fully automated luxury communism communism? How might you introduce that to someone who\u0026rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, I would say essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization \u0026ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible \u0026ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what\u0026rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.\nI should also say it really pushes back on the image and stereotype of a sort of bleak drab, sort of breadline poverty that many people associate with the term communism and tries to reinvent that term, from a position of abundance. So fully automated luxury communism really emphasizes communism instead of capitalism to because capitalism has these internal mechanisms that prevent it from generating abundance, it really relies on scarcity. Moreover, in a world where human labor is largely valueless in the production process \u0026ndash; that is a world where robots can do it so much better \u0026ndash; wages no longer makes sense. So you just gain either an income or some version of access to material benefits without necessarily putting in working hours.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning and we can talk maybe more about this later, there\u0026rsquo;s actually a manifesto style book that explains the concept by Aaron Bastani, entitled [Aaron Bastani | Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto], published by verso in 2019. But those are the broad strokes of the term, I\u0026rsquo;d say.\n[formatting added]\n[Della Z Duncan]\n[\u0026hellip;] Eric, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering what about you like you describe this sense of being in a grocery store and machine kind of delivering the goods on the on the shelves? What else might we see or feel in under fully automated luxury communism?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a great question. And I think like Mark Fisher, I also start with the questions of urbanism.\nI think urbanism is really important, it\u0026rsquo;s important to imagine our built environment operating under a different logic. So when I try to imagine a fully automated luxury communist world, the key thing I ponder is how our relationship to space and time would change. And something I really want to know is what cities would be like, again, if they were not oriented around work and consumerism. I mean, think about like how much of the street level experience is dominated by those things, and what it could be like if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThis is something that a friend of mine and collaborator, [unclear] Bria and I were working on and a project we were we had going last year called Imagining the Postwork City, where we invited artists and designers to submit visions of what postwork cities and an automated society could look like. And these are some of the prompts, which I think start to really answer the question.\nSo in terms of public space, you know what kinds of public spaces might exist in place of offices and factories and stores that currently dominate the landscapes of our downtown\u0026rsquo;s and central districts? What facilities and attractions might exist to occupy the time that\u0026rsquo;s freed from work? How might people interact with the forms and functions of the city and determine its uses? In terms of housing? What kinds of dwellings would people have in such a world? Would people even continue to have homes and the traditional sort of fixed sense? Or might they just drift, either from fixed place to fixed place, or else become part of a sort of urban hunter gatherer society, just eating, sleeping, playing wherever you happen to be at the time entirely in public spaces, never really claiming these as your own? Or perhaps we would always be on vacation and just follow some around the world? Who knows? This also leads into questions about the sort of regional distribution of the population would you know, if you\u0026rsquo;re not, if you\u0026rsquo;re no longer working, then you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be somewhere based on economic opportunity, that being the key driver of both migration and settlement patterns throughout history. So who knows? Maybe everyone would live in tropical regions, or maybe people who live in the types of regions that make them happy.\nThis begs questions of whether certain regions would perhaps depopulate and others would grow because they\u0026rsquo;re just more conducive to human happiness. Would existing cities dissipate as people became free of the economic tethers that keep them there? Would everyone become rural? I like to think we would continue to value cities but for new and better reasons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s infrastructural questions, what kinds of transit might we have, how we get around? How would goods be distributed? I mean, this vision of the grocery store that\u0026rsquo;s just sort of roboticized? Isn\u0026rsquo;t an interesting one. Would it continue to be a grocery store? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if you\u0026rsquo;d need walls around it anymore because there\u0026rsquo;s no point in stealing in a world where all the things are available to you.\nLots of questions too to ask about how we spend our time. And there\u0026rsquo;s no more sort of distinct breakdown between like leisure time and work time, you\u0026rsquo;re kind of always being creative. You know, you\u0026rsquo;d have new kinds of divisions between space and maybe have spaces specifically for rest and other spaces specifically for healing or for thinking or for feeling good, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it becomes a really exciting design problem, really.\nAnd it was fun to see what these artists and designers came up with in response to these prompts. There were lots of visions of green spaces, multi layered urbanism, drawing inspiration from resorts, you know, seeing resorts, and currently like luxury and exclusive spaces almost as like prefigurative little aspects of what the whole world can be like.\n[formatting added]\n[Zarinah Agnew]\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s one other thing I want to mention, which is, I think important, because I think when people think of communism, they think a lot of austerity and bleak equality, where everyone has access to the same things, but the things that they have access to a kind of rubbish. And I wanted to mention something from David Graeber, his most recent book, in which they reference indigenous and native forms of economics. And they talk about, you know, in these early forms of economic societies, people still had private ownership, they could have trinkets and objects and symbols, things that they use to denote the individualism, things that they gifted to others to sort of, say, thank you, and so on, and so forth. But crucially, the things that were privately owned, could not be turned into power over others. And the resources that were fundamental for collective survival, like land couldn\u0026rsquo;t be privately owned. And so I think what luxury communism points to is both the ability to make sure that everybody\u0026rsquo;s needs are met, and we have a good life. And also the sort of luxury and quality of being able to have our own aesthetic and our own ways of being and adorning our lives, I think is really important.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:upstreamFullyAutomatedLuxuryCommunism2022 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/4bb6597c-bbcb-431e-8639-9c64d41412e1/","summary":"Upstream, (NO_ITEM_DATA:upstreamFullyAutomatedLuxuryCommunism2022)\nSummary A discussion of Fully automated luxury communism.\nNotes [Della Z Duncan]\nAnd so what about this term, Fully automated luxury communism communism?

Backlinks Hash table ","title":"Hash function"},{"content":" In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map or dictionary, is a Data structure that implements a [Associative array], a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a Hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.\nIdeally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\nCollision resolution A search algorithm that uses hashing consists of two parts. The first part is computing a hash function which transforms the search key into an array index. The ideal case is such that no two search keys hashes to the same array index. However, this is not always the case and is impossible to guarantee for unseen given data. Hence the second part of the algorithm is collision resolution. The two common methods for collision resolution are Separate chaining and Open addressing.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\nSeparate chaining [\u0026hellip;] the process involves building a linked list with key–value pair for each search array index. The collided items are chained together through a single linked list, which can be traversed to access the item with a unique search key.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\nOpen addressing [\u0026hellip;] is another collision resolution technique in which every entry records are stored in the bucket array itself, and the hash resolution is performed through probing. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates an unsuccessful search.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\nWell-known probe sequences include:\nLinear probing, in which the interval between probes is fixed (usually 1). Quadratic probing, in which the interval between probes is increased by adding the successive outputs of a quadratic polynomial to the value given by the original hash computation. Double hashing, in which the interval between probes is computed by a secondary hash function. (“Hash Table” 2022)\nBibliography References “Hash Table.” 2022.

The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMain proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (\u0026ldquo;disorganized distress\u0026rdquo;), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.\n(“Attachment Theory” 2022)\nBibliography References “Attachment Theory.” 2022.

Mass shootings either happen or they don\u0026rsquo;t. You can talk about how much safer countries with robust gun control are, and they\u0026rsquo;ll just say, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s a shooting that happened in England. Here\u0026rsquo;s a shooting that happened in Australia. Gun control didn\u0026rsquo;t stop them. You can\u0026rsquo;t regulate evil.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the kind of sentence that can drive you up the wall, because it is, on its face, obviously true, but it\u0026rsquo;s only applicable in this context thanks to the word that\u0026rsquo;s implied but not stated: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t regulate all evil.\u0026rdquo; Yes, since they\u0026rsquo;ve had gun control, there have been shootings in England and Australia. Does it matter that these shootings are far less deadly and happen far less often? Does it matter that making guns harder to get has saved tens of thousands of lives? Like, do we really need to explain why stores put junk food you know you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t buy right next to the checkout counter? Because the easier it is to do a thing, the more it happens.\nThe mentality here is that, if you can\u0026rsquo;t stop every shooting, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother stopping any; if you can\u0026rsquo;t save every life, there\u0026rsquo;s no point improving healthcare. Nothing short of literally defeating death will be good enough.\nIt is a wholesale rejection of thinking in terms of systems. Notice how Payroll phrases his argument: \u0026ldquo;A bad person can always find a way to do bad things.\u0026rdquo; Person. Singular. If a criminal can still get a gun, they extrapolate that every criminal can get a gun, in the same way that, if a poor person can get a job, every poor person can get a job. Which, no. If there are fewer jobs than people who need them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be unemployment, and if there are fewer guns than people who want to shoot them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be less gun crime. If they talked about populations of people they\u0026rsquo;d have to acknowledge that some percentage succeeds at doing bad things and a percentage fails, and, since percentages are different across cultures, we must have some influence over them. But a binaristic model of \u0026ldquo;things either happen or they don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; leaves no room for percentages. Was there a shooting? Then there is still evil in the world.\nA conservative will generally agree with you about what the ills of society are: bigotry, violence, disease, oppression, poverty. But they don\u0026rsquo;t view them as problems to be solved. They are facts of life. Of course racism is terrible… but it\u0026rsquo;s a Monday. Trying to fight racism is like trying to fight the first law of motion. The only reason to even talk about it is to commiserate.\nAnd, on its face, this seems completely contradictory to all the other things they claim to believe. Sometimes you wanna scream at Payroll, \u0026ldquo;How can you think regulating guns won\u0026rsquo;t reduce shootings but somehow regulating women will reduce abortions?!\u0026rdquo; But here\u0026rsquo;s the real kicker: he doesn\u0026rsquo;t. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t think illegalizing abortions will make them happen less. What he wants is to throw people in jail for getting them. It\u0026rsquo;s right there in how he talks about gun rights: \u0026ldquo;Why should I be punished for the crimes of a monster?\u0026rdquo; To him, the law isn\u0026rsquo;t about shaping society, it\u0026rsquo;s about who gets punished [He\u0026rsquo;s not hurting the people he needs to be].\nIn this view, human nature is immutable. People are going to… be gay and do crime, and get abortions, and take drugs, and the law is not there to guide, it is there to judge. It is there it sanctify one particular walk of life as The Right Way. The reason they\u0026rsquo;re opposed to contraceptives and sex ed is not because they don\u0026rsquo;t work, but because they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter that kids who get abstinence-only education have just as much sex than the ones who learn about condoms; acknowledging that teenagers have sex is saying it\u0026rsquo;s ok, and abstinence says it\u0026rsquo;s not. And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s because you\u0026rsquo;re just not trying hard enough! More abstinence! More abstinence!\nTake, for example, the (often liberal) sentiment, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils.\u0026rdquo; There is no consequentialist argument for this. Perhaps if you and an organized bloc of citizens threatened to withhold your votes in order to influence policy, but, as a purely individual act, the consequentialist would argue your goal is to achieve the most ethical outcome. And that, if there are two evils, and one or the other is going to be in a position of power, voting for the lesser is more ethical than staying home. The consequentialist would argue you are just as responsible for the results of your inaction as for the actions you take. When both options are terrible, all you can do is mitigate the damage.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not generally the way it feels. It feels like refusing to participate, or choosing someone you want to win but whom you know isn\u0026rsquo;t going to, is the more ethical option. That voting for the lesser is a moral compromise. This feeling is independent of results. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mitigate damage, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce harm, but it does preserve your integrity [Ian Danskin | You Go High, We Go Low]. That feeling is very powerful; many politicians have staked their careers on it. Our society has always told us that voting for any flavor of evil will leave a stain on our souls; it continues to feel this way even among people who no longer believe in souls. The greatest difference between Left and Right is simply in how common and how intense this feeling is.\nThe necessary counternarrative is to stress that the problems we face are not natural features of the world, that, in fact, very little of human life is natural, and, even if it were, what is natural is not necessarily what is right. The way nature deals with a pandemic is to let everyone without a genetic resistance to the illness die, and, if what\u0026rsquo;s left is not a stable breeding population, you go extinct. That\u0026rsquo;s natural. Humanity as we know it only exists in defiance nature. Every form of bigotry, every means of oppression, is a thing we created; they are human problems, and they have human solutions. They have not always existed and there are places in the world where they are being addressed. The idea that the worst things on Earth have no great significance, that most evil is a chaotic mess borne of human fallibility, can be very depressing to consider; it can also be empowering.\nThis is a secular view. It can be reconciled with spirituality, but not with reactionary fundamentalism, which is the point. And it can be kind of baffling to have to assert that, when bad things happen, maybe we should do something about it? But you just can\u0026rsquo;t take for granted that, when someone agrees a thing is bad, they\u0026rsquo;re agreeing it\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:danskinHateMondays2020 Backlinks I hate mondays ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/d15c77d7-fde1-4f65-a68d-59a6a51ed7d1/","summary":"Ian Danskin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:danskinHateMondays2020)\nThis is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.\nSummary I hate mondays is an embrace of coping strategies and a refusal to address a problem stemming from the belief that the problem is unfixable.\nNotes [\u0026hellip;] conservative thinks about people dying of preventable illnesses, school shootings, and back alley abortions the way you think about Mondays.\nThe conservative mindset tends to sort things into binaries with no room for scale.","title":"Ian Danskin | I Hate Mondays"},{"content":" The low [Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)] say they\u0026rsquo;d like to be low RWAs.

And you conclude that, if you believe in democracy, you must believe in equality, and, if you believe in equality, you must believe in equal access to education, and must conclude that governments should help pay tuition. And so you give your friend the benefit of the doubt that, if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand this very simple logical progression, he either hasn\u0026rsquo;t had it properly explained to him, or has, at some point, been lied to. Because no one could believe in \u0026ldquo;all citizens are equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;always a bigger fish\u0026rdquo; at the same time.\nBut, by this thinking, you\u0026rsquo;re treating most conservatives as people who want, in their hearts, to be liberals, but have so far failed. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why they think liberals are condescending?\n[\u0026hellip;] when a choice between [capitalism and democracy] has to be made, a liberal is someone who tends to think democratically, and a conservative is someone who tends to think like a capitalist.\nTHE OPERATIVE WORD HERE IS \u0026ldquo;TEND.\u0026rdquo; Liberals are still capitalists and conservatives still stan for democracy, and the preference for one or the other may be very slight. Nevertheless, which way a person leans reveals their priorities.\nThe democratic framework - or, at least, a democratic framework - is \u0026ldquo;one citizen, one vote.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are, you are born with certain in- or possibly unalienable rights, and any system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you those rights is a tyranny. Freedom, agency, and a hand in the strictures that govern you; everyone is entitled to these things. It\u0026rsquo;s an egalitarian mindset; people gain power by electoral process, i.e. when it is granted to them by the masses, with whom the true power resides, and whom the Constitution guarantees the right to take that power away from an electee. Rather than powerful, the elected official is, in a sense, an employee with millions of bosses, all of whom have equal authority. This is the idea of democracy, with the history of democracy being riddled with failures to live up to this ideal, but part of the project of liberalism has been about making the government more closely resemble its ideology.\nThe capitalist framework, by contrast, is that of businesses and markets, where \u0026ldquo;big fish eat the little ones.\u0026rdquo; If two people start businesses in the same field, and one makes more profit than the other, that person can make more investments, open more locations, undercut their competitor\u0026rsquo;s prices. The more money you have, the more money you can make. So advantage compounds, where even small failures often mean getting muscled out of the field. Now, with some creativity - a novel cost-saving practice or a new delivery method - the underdog can still thrive, and this is part of what conservatives like about the market: that it demands this creativity in a live-ammo environment. But most will not beat the odds; that\u0026rsquo;s how odds work. Since there will always be more failures than successes, the general trajectory of unregulated capitalism is money pooling into fewer and fewer hands. Things naturally sort themselves into a hierarchy with sharks at top, a million minnows at the bottom.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn conservative thinking, this hierarchy is humanity\u0026rsquo;s natural state. The American Dream is \u0026ldquo;here, anyone can make it.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are or what you start with, you can become a billionaire. But a necessary component of this is: anyone can, but everyone can\u0026rsquo;t. We\u0026rsquo;re not all gonna be billionaires, there\u0026rsquo;s a finite amount of money in this country. For any one person to have so, so, so much more than they need, there must - mathematically - be thousands of people with less. Your conservative friend is often baffled as to what you\u0026rsquo;re even trying to say when you point out there\u0026rsquo;s not enough high-paying jobs or affordable health plans for everyone; there\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be. The system requires an underclass. Someone\u0026rsquo;s gotta clean the toilets.\nCapitalism, then, is a proving ground. It\u0026rsquo;s how you demonstrate where in the hierarchy you deserve to be. Do you have more than you need, or less? Anything you\u0026rsquo;ve got, you beat someone else to it. How resourceful were you? How well did you play? The field is, by no means, level, but any disadvantage just means you have to work harder. We know people who start with nothing can win big; if you are a shark, you will make your way to the top, because that\u0026rsquo;s where you belong. Anyone complaining about how stacked the deck is against them is making excuses for not being better at the game.\nDisadvantage itself is not a problem, so long as it is (quote-unquote) \u0026ldquo;natural.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s necessary is that advantage and disadvantage not be imposed from without. Free tuition, a high minimum wage, taxes on the wealthy, or any other kind of government meddling, these things must be opposed, because, with them, people would end up in the wrong places. Power has to be earned; if it isn\u0026rsquo;t earned, it won\u0026rsquo;t be properly wielded, and then society ends up a mess. Conservatives generally feel what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the world today can be chalked up to people not being where they should be in the social order. They used to be where they belonged, but then liberals gummed everything up with their government handouts and forced representation. (When, exactly, things were the way they should be is a bit of a moving target: nowadays, they act like it was the 80\u0026rsquo;s, in the 80\u0026rsquo;s it was the 50\u0026rsquo;s, and in the 50\u0026rsquo;s it was some time before the New Deal. So, following the nostalgia cycle, it\u0026rsquo;s usually \u0026ldquo;about thirty years ago.\u0026rdquo;)\nConservatives are distrustful of any effort to make society more equal because, deep down, they don\u0026rsquo;t believe equal societies are real. Obviously, \u0026ldquo;all citizens created equal\u0026rdquo; needs to be the government\u0026rsquo;s position, because you can\u0026rsquo;t trust the government to know where to put people, so it has to treat everyone the same. But this is a legal fiction, like corporate personhood. It just means \u0026ldquo;the government leaves the market alone so the hierarchy can reveal itself.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to believe in an equal distribution of power. What are you, seven? This is just the way the world is. Look at alpha wolves, silverbacks; consider the lobster.\nYou are one, single individual within a system, and it is your job to rise or fall within it on the sweat of your own back. You don\u0026rsquo;t change the system. Society\u0026rsquo;s problems come from the rules being too weakly enforced. The answer is always more discipline. Your conservative friend thinks you\u0026rsquo;re naive for thinking the system even can be changed, and his is the charitable interpretation! Many conservatives assume liberals - at least, the smart liberals - know that the hierarchy is eternal, that there will always be people at the top and people at the bottom, so any claim towards making things equal must be a Trojan horse for something that benefits them [Realpolitik]. (Why would they assume that? Because that\u0026rsquo;s what they do.) The real liberal agenda is to put people in the wrong places on purpose. Boost liberal allies, hold back liberal opposition. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to break up the pyramid, you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to sneak someone else to the top.\nA lot of conservative contradictions start to make sense through this lens. Of any issue, simply ask: does this distribute power, or consolidate it? If power flows up the hierarchy, they\u0026rsquo;re for it, if it flows down, they\u0026rsquo;re against it.\nThe thing about hierarchies is that they\u0026rsquo;re self-similar on many scales. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle, then you serve the king. Valar dohaeris [Valar dohaeris]. But, to everyone beneath you, you are the king. You\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job and a good wage, that gives you some power over people who don\u0026rsquo;t. And getting pissed at those above implies that those below have a right to be pissed at you. There\u0026rsquo;s a real anxiety that liberals want to make room for those people in the middle by putting conservatives at the bottom, and that those people will then treat conservatives the way conservatives treated them. Freedom, respect, and empathy are looked on as finite resources in a competitive marketplace just like jobs and scholarships.\nNo matter how much a conservative believes in \u0026ldquo;earning\u0026rdquo; one\u0026rsquo;s place, they have, always in the back of their mind, an image of what society should look like, and any discrepancy between imagination and observation must mean foul play. This feminist is too respected, this Black superhero is too popular, it can\u0026rsquo;t be because they\u0026rsquo;re worthy; someone must have put their hand on the scales. Someone got a freebie or played the race card or faked a scandal. This means, even though they claim the hierarchy is natural, what they will or won\u0026rsquo;t accept as legitimate is a gut feeling. If they like what they see, they take credit for it; if they don\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s the Left\u0026rsquo;s fault. And what does it say about them that they see a bunch of white, male sharks and think, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s authentic\u0026rdquo;?\nSavvy viewers may be remembering another political philosophy that is hierarchical, undemocratic, built on nostalgia, and that likes to cloak its policies in progressive camouflage, and that\u0026rsquo;s the one from two videos ago: fascism. (ooooooohhhhhh golly) Now: I am not calling conservatives fascists. There are distinctions: Under fascism, the hierarchy is much, much less meritocratic, and the nostalgia is much, much older. However: conservative thinking is, at the very least, one that fascism maps more cleanly onto. Fascists appeal to this hierarchical mindset by portraying all of history as struggles between ethnic groups over who gets to be where. \u0026ldquo;Someone\u0026rsquo;s got to be at the bottom, white man. We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure it isn\u0026rsquo;t you.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll find, throughout history, that fascist movements, though they often pick up dissidents from all over the political spectrum (the \u0026ldquo;Third Position,\u0026rdquo; for instance, is fascism for anti-capitalists), when they find purchase in a political party, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much always the conservative party. Look at France, look at Brazil, look at here. Whether you want to interpret that as conservatives being uniquely susceptible to fascists, or diet fascism being another name for conservatism, I leave that up to you.\nThe most important thing to understand is that you cannot communicate with nor anticipate the behaviors of a conservative if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they believe. Which is hard, because they\u0026rsquo;re often in denial. You will never convince them to compromise on any attempt to break up the hierarchy, because even incremental change strikes them as revolutionary and they feel they\u0026rsquo;ve made too many concessions already. You will never get them, of their own free will, to agree to government regulation, because the government, as a democratic institution, is inherently unnatural. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like what a business is doing, you don\u0026rsquo;t regulate it, you take your money elsewhere. You should favor the capitalist solution, not the democratic one. (Also, when you vote with your dollar, people with more dollars get more votes.) They will never be onboard with aiding the poor in any systemic way, and will, instead, champion charity and crowdfunding, because minnows getting to eat should always be framed as a gift rather than a right. You may get individual conservatives to come around on some of these, but, as a body, they will never consent to any of it unless they can work it to their advantage or if you have leverage over them. They will sign on when denying progressivism costs them something, because few things terrify them more than slipping down the hierarchy [Also, Authoritarian followers place \u0026ldquo;being normal\u0026rdquo; substantially higher than most people do].\nA good defense against fascism is to consciously, intentionally, think and act in democratic terms, because newsflash: we\u0026rsquo;re not actually lobsters. Neither of these systems is natural. They are choices we can make. I recommend this one, because egalitarian thinking is one thing Nazis are bad at infiltrating.\nIf you want to fight fascism, move left.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2019. “Always a Bigger Fish.” Tumblr.

And you\u0026rsquo;re not really taking a position, but claiming to believe in whatever would need to be true to score points against me, like we\u0026rsquo;re in that one episode of Seinfeld.\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a certain Beat-You-At-Your-Own-Gaminess to the Card Says Moops maneuver. \u0026ldquo;Safe spaces are bullshit, but, if you get one, I get one too.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as systemic oppression, but, if there were, I\u0026rsquo;d be oppressed.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s dismissing the rhetoric of social justice while also trying to use it against you. Claiming \u0026ldquo;the Card Says Moops\u0026rdquo; does not, so much, mean, \u0026ldquo;I believe the people who invaded Spain in the 8th Century were literally called The Moops,\u0026rdquo; but, rather, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t prove I don\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\u0026rdquo; Not a statement of sincere belief, simply moving a piece across the board. All in the game, yo.\nIf they could be so nakedly honest with you and themselves to answer \u0026ldquo;what do you actually believe\u0026rdquo; truthfully, one suspects the answer would be, \u0026ldquo;What difference does it make? We\u0026rsquo;re right either way.\u0026rdquo;\nThis has come to be known as \u0026ldquo;postmodern conservatism,\u0026rdquo; a fact I find hilarious, because, in The Discourse, \u0026ldquo;postmodernism\u0026rdquo; is a dogwhistle for everything the Right hates about the Left. (…it also means \u0026ldquo;Jews.\u0026rdquo;) Postmodern conservatism is the thinking that, at least for the purpose of argument, the truth of who invaded Spain is immaterial. You have your facts, I have alternative facts. What is true? Who\u0026rsquo;s to say?\nSincerity is unprovable and open to interpretation. Decide someone is sincere if you want to make fun of them, decide they\u0026rsquo;re trolling if you want to make fun of someone else. What is true? What do you want to be true? It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to start thinking of one\u0026rsquo;s own opinions the same way: What do I believe? What is it advantageous to believe? Your answer isn\u0026rsquo;t binding. You\u0026rsquo;ll change it later if you need to.\nThe thing is, Bob, it\u0026rsquo;s not that they\u0026rsquo;re lying, it\u0026rsquo;s that they just don\u0026rsquo;t care. I\u0026rsquo;ll say that again for the cheap seats: When they make these kinds of arguments, they legitimately do not care whether the words coming out of their mouths are true. It is a deeply held belief for precisely as long as it wins arguments.\nYou might now conclude the internet reactionary believes in nothing except winning arguments with liberals. And, like Newtonian physics, if you assume this framing, you will get highly useful results. If you enter conversation with Engelbert and Charlemagne believing they do not mean what they say, they are only entertaining notions, and, on a long enough timeline, they will eventually defend a position fundamentally incompatible with the one they defended earlier in the same argument, you will navigate that conversation much more effectively!\nBut, like Newtonian physics, this framing is lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True [Lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True].\n[Why is it always the libs?]\nSo much of conservative rhetoric is about maintaining ignorance of one\u0026rsquo;s own beliefs. To uphold the institution of imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy while thinking you are none of those things. (Well, OK, knowing you\u0026rsquo;re a capitalist, but thinking it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.) Most people have a baseline of fairly conventional, kindergarten morality, and conservatism often clashes with it. You can rationalize these contradictions - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a bigot, I just believe in states\u0026rsquo; rights\u0026rdquo; - but, as American conservatism gets more radical, it gets harder to square one\u0026rsquo;s politics with what one assumes to be one\u0026rsquo;s beliefs. So you learn, when someone challenges you, to cycle through beliefs until something sticks, just play your hand and trust that you\u0026rsquo;re right, or, in extreme cases, insist you have no beliefs at all, you\u0026rsquo;re just here to watch the world burn.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re not. They are willing participants in the burning of only certain parts. They don\u0026rsquo;t care what they believe, but they know what they hate, and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about why they hate it. On paper, they believe in freedom of religion and freedom of expression, but they also hang out in communities where Muslims and trans women are punching bags. And, like a sixth grader who believes one thing in Sunday school and another thing in biology class, they believe different things at different times.\nIf you operate as though there is no truth, just competing opinions, and as though opinions aren\u0026rsquo;t sincere, just tools to be picked up and dropped depending on their utility, then what are you operating under? Self-interest. The desire to win. You\u0026rsquo;ll defend the Holocaust just to feel smarter than someone, superior. Think about how beautifully that maps onto the in-group/out-group mentality of dominance and bigotry. Think how incompatible it is with liberal ideas of tolerance. I think this is why we don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of these \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just here to fuck shit up\u0026rdquo; types on the Left. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the Left has gotten on some bullshit, but (excepting politicians, whom you should never assume to mean anything they say) it\u0026rsquo;s sincerely-believed bullshit! We don\u0026rsquo;t build identities around saying things just to piss people off.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2019. “The Card Says Moops.” Tumblr.

But in response the Republicans… seize the Supreme Court.\nWhen one party can be relied on to do the exact opposite of your worst behavior, good strategy is to do to them, as destructively as possible, whatever you don\u0026rsquo;t want them to do to you.\n[\u0026hellip;] building a coalition on the Left is a lot of work, and, faced with this challenge, there is a liberal tendency to turn away from policy and focus instead on process; generally uncontroversial things like bipartisanship, compromise, decorum. And, fair enough, the absence of these things in Washington over the years is certainly something everyone Left-of-Center is sick of, but they\u0026rsquo;re not things Democrats can make happen all by themselves, and, more to the point, none of them are results. They\u0026rsquo;re means.\nLike, a willingness to compromise is not a position. And when you overfocus on how you should go about things and not what things you should go about, it fosters a certain philosophy about government that is both highly flawed and highly exploitable: The valuing of means at the expense of ends.\nMost people would say that \u0026ldquo;the ends justify the means\u0026rdquo; is a crap moral philosophy. Democrats would agree. But liberals often overcorrect to the point where thinking about the ends at all is thought of as - in a vague, reflexive kind of way - innately immoral. There\u0026rsquo;s a very Enlightenment way of thinking that implies that, with the right means, the ends take care of themselves, and immoral behavior becomes functionally impossible.\n[\u0026hellip;] Democrats keep doing it, because on some level they genuinely believe that, even when it accomplishes nothing, following the rules to the bitter end is the noble thing to do. The captain goes down with the ship.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll say one thing for Republicans: They believe in something. It\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of classist, racist, misogynist doolally, but they believe it, and they govern according to those beliefs. There is no contradiction in blocking a liberal Judge and bullying Democrats to confirm a conservative one: They want to overturn the right to abortion, and will do whatever it takes to put a pro-lifer on the bench. It\u0026rsquo;s fully consistent behavior. And the problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that they break a bunch of rules along the way, it\u0026rsquo;s that what they\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish is wrong.\nBut Democrats focus on the rule-breaking and not the intent behind it because, despite what Republicans will tell you, many Democrats are terrified of talking about abortion, for fear that taking a stand on a wedge issue will lose them their coalition. Believing in a politics where everyone can disagree on everything and democracy sorts it out is wishful thinking born of necessity.\nWhat would be the effective ways to combat the Alt-Right? Kick them off social media, shut down their websites, cut off their funding, police their organizations as hate groups, and, if all else fails, be willing to deck someone at a counter-protest if it will prevent greater violence. So what do they do to us? Falsely report our tweets as hatespeech, DDoS our websites, try to shut down our Patreons, report us to the police as terrorists, and beat and murder people in the streets. Now, these are all things they enjoy doing regardless, but they serve a strategic purpose. If we consider doing to them anything like to what they\u0026rsquo;ve done to us, we get the performative self-flagellation: \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to stoop to our level, now would you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd when they tell us it would be wrong to kick them off Twitter or stop them from organizing even though they keep killing people, what argument do they give us? They invoke the First Amendment. They defend not their actions but the process. They don\u0026rsquo;t believe in universal free speech or the right to assemble, but they know we do.\nAn action has no intrinsic value wholly separate from its outcome. A Kentucky clerk breaking the law by refusing to sign a legal gay marriage license is wrong. And a California clerk breaking the law by signing an illegal gay marriage license is right. There is a moral imperative to disobey rules when following does not lead to justice.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:danskinYouGoHighWeGoLow2018 Backlinks Ian Danskin | I Hate Mondays You go high, we go low ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/f39cbb1c-8265-4f3e-9a99-632132ade597/","summary":"Ian Danskin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:danskinYouGoHighWeGoLow2018)\nThis is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.\nSummary Going low is a manifestation of playing to win \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a focus on the ends justifying the means.

They seemingly want the impossible: they want segregation without appearing to be segregationists, racist policy without the social repercussions. Possibly, they don\u0026rsquo;t even want to admit their racism to themselves. Silvermilk would need a framing that allowed the blithely racist, the overtly racist, and the non-racist to unite under a single banner.\nFor this purpose, Silvermilk landed on the long-enduring euphemism: \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rsquo; rights.\u0026rdquo; [You\u0026rsquo;re getting so abstract]\nStates\u0026rsquo; rights was invoked - and is still invoked - to defend anti-miscegenation laws, anti-abortion laws, same-sex marriage bans, trans bathroom bills, spousal rape, you name it. Every time there are gains for social minorities, the Republicans shore up the votes of bigots who find these gains offensive.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard for the Left to argue with the \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rsquo; rights\u0026rdquo; argument because it\u0026rsquo;s not designed to make sense. Republicans will say we should leave an issue like same-sex marriage up to the states, but only after a Federal ban on same-sex marriage proves infeasible. Up until that moment, they are in favor of government overreach. So \u0026ldquo;states\u0026rsquo; rights\u0026rdquo; has never been a consistent philosophy, but, then, why should it be? It\u0026rsquo;s a euphemism. Its sole purpose is bringing an extreme ideology into mainstream politics.\n[\u0026hellip;] loyalty is one of the strongest things in politics today. Come Election Day, people who disavowed him was making phone calls on [Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s] behalf.\nA euphemism dies when it no longer works to disguise things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said, or when culture at large decides things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said are now sayable. In the last couple videos, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about how the Far Right mainstreams a, for instance, racist idea by convincing people it\u0026rsquo;s not racist. What we\u0026rsquo;re seeing here is the endgame of that process: once the public embraces them as people, elects their politicians, and implements their policies, they begin, bit by bit, to drop the pretense. Because, if they want to close the borders once and for all, it\u0026rsquo;s in their best interest to stop pretending border control is about protecting jobs.\nA sad truth about humans is they will often accept almost any justification to keep doing whatever they\u0026rsquo;re already doing [Cognitive dissonance]. If someone has spent years favoring border security - they\u0026rsquo;ve voted for it, their taxes have paid for it, maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve even called ICE on someone - and one day you tell them, \u0026ldquo;Keep doing what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, but, by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s not about jobs anymore, now it\u0026rsquo;s about keeping Mexicans out,\u0026rdquo; a lot of them will roll with it. We like to think action follows belief, and sometimes it does, but at least as often it\u0026rsquo;s the reverse. And that\u0026rsquo;s a dangerous thing when given the choice to do something different or do the same thing only more.\nTo the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right.

I find their work very inspiring.\u0026rdquo; So you look a little deeper into the story, and you come to understand a few things. First, it turns out, by \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X\u0026rdquo; they mean an employee of Public Figure X. Well, employees are often acting on behalf of their employers; if your campaign staff meets with Russians, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say you are in contact with Russia, so maybe this is something like that. Also, it turns out that, by \u0026ldquo;employee\u0026rdquo; they mean a contractor that Public Figure X hired several years ago. Well, OK, if a contractor does something on behalf of a client, that\u0026rsquo;s often basically the same as an employee doing it. And, apparently, by \u0026ldquo;doxxed\u0026rdquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t mean Public Figure X - or Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s contractor - personally hacked anyone\u0026rsquo;s computer, they mean Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s people shared information that had been acquired by someone else. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s fair, if someone posts your home address on a forum and then the forum spreads it all over the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say the forum doxxed you. Oh, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a home address or a private email, it was the person\u0026rsquo;s name. Well, if you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous for safety reasons, having your name revealed can lead to threats or silencing, so, depending on why you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous, having your name leaked can be a kind of doxxing. Oh, and by \u0026ldquo;leaking a name,\u0026rdquo; they mean, liked a tweet that had the name in it.\nOK, now say you\u0026rsquo;re bumming around Facebook - which, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, but I do it, too - and someone posts an article saying \u0026ldquo;All pornography is coercive.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty sweeping statement! I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta investigate this.\u0026rdquo; So you read the article, and it seems there\u0026rsquo;s a school of thought that, since, in porn, the product is usually images of women\u0026rsquo;s bodies, women tend to be socially pressured or financially incentivized to do things with their bodies that people like to see but they aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily comfortable with. Since that consent is not freely given, all pornography is coercive. And you think, \u0026ldquo;Well, but what about worker-owned porn collectives, or amateur porn that\u0026rsquo;s just exhiitionists who don\u0026rsquo;t monetize their videos?\u0026rdquo; And, after digging around the author\u0026rsquo;s work, you find, buried in a footnote in another article, that, in their opinion, if it\u0026rsquo;s worker-owned or unmonetized, it isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;porn,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;erotica.\u0026rdquo;\nNow say you\u0026rsquo;ve ambled into the wildlands of Tumblr - woe betide the ones who travel too far from their dashboards - and you come across the claim that \u0026ldquo;[Activist Y] is a bigot.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Ah jeez, first Public Figure X and now this?\u0026rdquo; So you read a number of other posts on the subject, and eventually piece together that, by \u0026ldquo;bigot,\u0026rdquo; the people making this claim mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; - which, no question, that is a bigotry - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; - which, OK, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; - which is definitely a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;is critical of the sexual objectification of women in Fantasy imagery because they believe it drives women away from the community.\u0026rdquo;\nHow many words can you change in an argument until it\u0026rsquo;s not the same argument anymore?\nThere are a few different aims when somebody does this:\nMaking the unacceptable acceptable\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Activist Y is against sexual objectification\u0026rdquo; is not controversial amongst progressives.

But if you redefine this as \u0026ldquo;anti-sex,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;a bigot,\u0026rdquo; now it\u0026rsquo;s Activist Y who has the enemies, and you\u0026rsquo;ve just smuggled an anti-feminist argument into feminist language.\nMaking the unremarkable remarkable\n\u0026ldquo;Some pornography is coercive\u0026rdquo; is not the kind of take that sells magazine subscriptions. But if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a private definition of \u0026ldquo;pornography\u0026rdquo; that excludes sexually explicit material that isn\u0026rsquo;t coercive, you\u0026rsquo;ve got yourself a provocative headline, especially since, at first glance, nobody knows you\u0026rsquo;re using a nonstandard definition of the word.\nCutting people off from their communities\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Someone who used to work with Public Figure X liked a tweet that had my name in it\u0026rdquo; gets converted into \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X doxxed me\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of turning Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s community against them, with the added benefit of gaining favor with anyone who already hates them. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard abusive [relationship] tactic: if you want to mistreat someone, first you cut them off from their friends.\n[formatting added]\nOne can make the (already dubious) argument that this isnt technically a lie, but it\u0026rsquo;s meant to form a picture in your mind of something that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen [\u0026hellip;].\n[\u0026hellip;] when the Right does this, it does it to the Left, and, when the Left does this, it does it to itself. The Far Right is perfectly happy converting an attack or a bad argument into whatever they think progressive language sounds like, and bigots on the Left are perfectly happy sneaking transphobic arguments into feminism, but the Left, by and large, will not touch conservative language. We don\u0026rsquo;t try to isolate a member of the Alt-Right by telling his community he\u0026rsquo;s a race traitor or secretly gay.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2018. “The Ship of Theseus.” Tumblr.

They become demystified. Some people who thought they were strange and threatening will start to warm up to them, though this does not happen across the board. Many who hated them when they were fringe will see their becoming mainstream as a kind of existential occupation of territory, as in \u0026ldquo;If this is normal now, what does that make me?\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;] let\u0026rsquo;s not beat around the bush: Language and Visibility are tools of consolidating power. Visibility means having a sense of your numbers. Common language means forming alliances.\nCulture is plastic. Any fringe group or idea can become normalized, regardless of its inherent worth. And, for a certain subset of extremely online people with fringe beliefs, who understand the ways mainstreaming has evolved in the attention economy, it can be a weapon.\nMainstreaming is not a wholly organic process, because usually the people who get mainstreamed are actively working to become so. But people usually have only so much control over how and how fast this happens: A group expands its language and visibility; if this leads to larger numbers and greater mainstream acceptance, the process repeats, this time with a bigger group and a bigger audience; so long as there is growth, each cycle is more impactful, as the bigger a group is the faster it gets even bigger and the more common language becomes the faster it proliferates.\nBy all rights, if your beliefs are wildly unpopular, this process shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. Your language and visibility don\u0026rsquo;t expand because too many people don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk like you or about you. So what do you do then? Well, normally, you either give up or bide your time, but, if you have a lot of media literacy and no real moral compass, you get it done dirty.\nIf the media doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to cover you, make yourself newsworthy. Threaten to publicly out immigrants in front of a crowd. Start a hoax about white student unions. Lead a white power rally and leave the hoods at home. Do the kinds of things that journalists cannot, in good conscience, ignore. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve made yourself news, they\u0026rsquo;ll feel they can\u0026rsquo;t publish a condemnation without getting your side of the story, so, bam, you\u0026rsquo;ve got an interview. The more erratic and dangerous you seem, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll want to write a profile so people can figure you out; the article about how surprisingly normal you seem in person basically writes itself. If you want to spread a conspiracy theory, send it to a small, local news site that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the resources to fact check you; once they publish something salacious, all the bigger news channels will have to talk about it, if only to debunk it. Put provocative stuff in front of politicians; anything they retweet has to be news. In a pinch, you can always piggyback off a famous activist by making takedown videos, or, if you\u0026rsquo;re really ambitious, harass someone at a conference.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s desperate for clicks. If you can generate them, you\u0026rsquo;ll get your message out.\nIf nobody\u0026rsquo;s adopting your language, adopt it for them. Make sure you and all your friends each have half a dozen fake Twitter accounts spamming the same terminology at everyone who discusses race, gender, orientation, or ability. Put every Jewish name in parentheses until everyone on the internet knows what that means whether they want to or not. Hell, don\u0026rsquo;t even do it yourself: Russia\u0026rsquo;s not the only one who can make bots. Make thousands of bots. And make sure your real account, your fake accounts, and your bots all talk the same so no one can tell the difference anymore. Make hashtags and get them trending all by yourself, and, while you\u0026rsquo;re at it, spam all the hashtags for movements you hate with porn and gore so they can\u0026rsquo;t be used. And if your words and memes still aren\u0026rsquo;t popular? Just steal words and memes that are already popular. Just decide \u0026ldquo;this? this means white power now,\u0026rdquo; [Pepe the frog] \u0026ldquo;this is antifeminist now\u0026rdquo; [\u0026ldquo;triggered\u0026rdquo;]. Saturate the web with your new usage, always insisting that you\u0026rsquo;re doing it \u0026ldquo;ironically,\u0026rdquo; [For the lulz] while eroding confidence in anyone who uses these words in the original sense. And never stop insisting that most everyone would talk the same as you if there weren\u0026rsquo;t so much damn censorship.\nAnd where Delany saw a group of 80 or 90 gay men reported in the papers as a group of 4 or 5, the Alt-Right wants to get reported as being much larger than it actually is. They want to draw attention to themselves by any means necessary, up to and including violence, but to ensure that, any time the cameras train on a violent act, there is a man in a suit ready to distance himself from it; to paint the picture that, but for a few bad actors, this is a peaceful movement of young, presentable intellectuals.\nMuch as we\u0026rsquo;d like to believe people are driven by morality, most people are driven by the desire to be normal [Bob Altemeyer | The Authoritarians]. And when the news is filled with images of swastikas, iron crosses, and tiki torches, the guy in the suit with the fashy haircut looks pretty normal by comparison. And that\u0026rsquo;s why he wears the suit.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2018. “Mainstreaming.” Tumblr.

Display the outward signs of winning \u0026ndash; confidence, always have a comeback, speak in soundbites, attack attack attack \u0026ndash; and the audience may think that you won even if your opponent refutes your argument.\nNotes You also notice the pattern of the conversation: he says something short, quippy, and wrong, you give a detailed correction, he says something else short, quippy, wrong, and only tangentially related to his last point, and the cycle repeats itself. This goes on and on.\nThe running theme here is all these people who ostensibly want a frank exchange of ideas spend a lot more time making accusations than asking questions. Because, why ask what you believe when they can tell you what you believe and make you correct them? And if you ever don\u0026rsquo;t correct them, must be because they\u0026rsquo;re right.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;re not naive; you see what\u0026rsquo;s going on here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about conversation, it\u0026rsquo;s about boxes. When you say something cogent that they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with, and they get the sinking feeling that you might start making sense, they need a reason not to listen to you [Cognitive dissonance]. So they reach for a box to stick you in: dishonest feminism, fake progressivism, daddy-issue liberalism. No one in those boxes is worth listening to, which means, as long as they\u0026rsquo;ve got you in one, they\u0026rsquo;re not at risk of having their minds changed. This isn\u0026rsquo;t even an argument with you, not really; their presenting themselves with arguments for why they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to you.\nSo your first reflex is to defy their expectations. \u0026ldquo;Actually, my dad was a draft-dodging hippie who told me he loved me every day.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And I never said what genders my partners are but I promise they\u0026rsquo;re all feminists.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As for my accent- actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with the accent thing.\u0026rdquo; But the point is, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to fit in your box.\u0026rdquo; And if they can\u0026rsquo;t put you in one, if they can\u0026rsquo;t dismiss you outright, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to engage with your argument.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;ve spent any time arguing with angry dudes online you know what I\u0026rsquo;m about to say: They don\u0026rsquo;t. This accusatory, condescending attitude never falters. Because a technique that has permeated anti-progressivism is to Never Play Defense.\nNow don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, what I said about the Right fitting the Left into simplified boxes as a way of preserving their own egos, I do think that\u0026rsquo;s a thing, at least for many people much of the time. And I think the reassurance it brings is why the technique stays so popular. But that framing is about how individual people are feeling in isolated moments, and leaves out the larger game that\u0026rsquo;s being played. Because there is a long-term strategic value to never playing defense, and it\u0026rsquo;s less to do with arguments than with attitude.\nFrom your perspective, this debate about the feminist is a joke. This guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about, he comes in hot without confirming any of his assumptions, the whole conversation is you repeatedly schooling an ignorant dipshit. But that\u0026rsquo;s only if you\u0026rsquo;re the fool who listens to what\u0026rsquo;s actually being said. Never Play Defense is a strategy that looks past language to posture; the tone, word choice, even the expressions on your faces. If you half-focus your eyes and look not at the words but the flow of the conversation, you can see the dynamic at play:\nHe says his short, quippy statement, and you give your detailed rebuttal. He then picks a single point from your response and attacks that as the new subject. Now, to an onlooker, the logical brain would register that he\u0026rsquo;s leaving 90% of your argument on the table, and that, by changing positions, he\u0026rsquo;s conceding he lost the first round. But the lizard brain notices that he\u0026rsquo;s always making the accusations, always in the dominant position, that he\u0026rsquo;s always acting and you\u0026rsquo;re always reacting. Regardless of what is said, he displays all the outward signs of winning. So, on a purely emotional level, he leaves the impression of being right.\nI have never had an argument look like this that wasn\u0026rsquo;t in public. This is a technique that means speaking not so much to the other person as to the people watching [Speak directly to the audience]. Liberals tend to operate as though voters are beings of pure reason, and neglect that rational people still have emotions, and those emotions factor into what they believe. And that long after this argument is over, when people only half-remember what was said, what lingers on is what impressions the speakers made.\nRonald Reagan coined the phrase, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re explaining, you\u0026rsquo;re losing.\u0026rdquo; The trick is, if he\u0026rsquo;s always accusing, then you\u0026rsquo;re always explaining.\n[\u0026hellip;] if you never look like you\u0026rsquo;re losing, you can convince a lot of people that you\u0026rsquo;re [winning]. And, if you keep your statements short and punchy, people will remember what you said better than they remember the long explanation of why it\u0026rsquo;s untrue.

Even if an onlooker recognizes that she literally did not con anyone out of their money, the idea that how much she asked for and how long she took to deliver are relevant to her credibility is still planted in their heads. It subtly suggests that, the next time they feel threatened by a female media critic, maybe they should look at how much money she makes, how long her work takes to produce; maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to her, because they\u0026rsquo;ve got this handy box.\n[\u0026hellip;] The Alt-Right is a box factory, putting huge swaths of Leftist rhetoric, most especially that that would rebut their core positions, into categories where they can be summarily ignored.\nA detailed explanation lands a lot better when it\u0026rsquo;s not being contrasted with a sound bite.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Never Play Defense.” Tumblr.

More specifically, it\u0026rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.\nNotes [\u0026hellip;] every one of these bad arguments is a subtle attempt to change the subject.\nWhat is the purpose of debate? The liberal conception of debate is usually along the lines of Joseph Joubert\u0026rsquo;s adage, \u0026ldquo;The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re thinking Plato and Glaucon, or, maybe, debate club: two sides debate until one side wins or until a third conclusion is reached together; either way, the goal of debate is to arrive at the truth.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not what debate means on the Right. There, debate is a chance to perform strength, integrity, and certainty. There, you don\u0026rsquo;t debate until a victor is declared, you debate as long as you can keep eyeballs on you, forever if possible. There, the truth doesn\u0026rsquo;t win, because nobody wins, not in any formal way. You may scoff at that, but let\u0026rsquo;s think about it: this is how political debates are structured in the US, where two candidates come in already knowing everything they\u0026rsquo;re going to say, where it\u0026rsquo;s political suicide to concede any point or find any compromise, and where who \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; is up to the voters. In such a framework, truth and falsity don\u0026rsquo;t exist; all that matters is how much of the audience agrees with you. And, if that\u0026rsquo;s your framework, then what\u0026rsquo;s in your best interest is to steer the conversation swiftly and efficiently to something you and your opponent will never agree on, because that gives you the most opportunities to look firm in front of an adversary.\n[\u0026hellip;] the Left\u0026rsquo;s understanding of systemic issues does not jive with the Right\u0026rsquo;s views on personal responsibility. Yes, of course, if the President spoke this way in the White House it might be alienating to any woman who works there, but the Right sees this as a personal failing on the part of the woman, not a systemic failing on the part of men. And all the articles, all the data, all the reports that say that\u0026rsquo;s now how things work in practice, they are useless in the framework of a performative Twitter argument or a one-hour TV debate. A proper understanding of institutional sexism just takes longer than that.\nWhy would anyone use this framework? Well, if your opposition has facts on their side, then you need a framework where facts aren\u0026rsquo;t important. But, more broadly, if the goal is to win over the public, well, the public does respond to honesty, but they also respond to moral certainty, and the Right tends to sell certainty better than the Left sells truth. This is what they\u0026rsquo;re good at; this suits their worldview. They speak of a universe where opposing sides never agree, because agreement is impossible. And, since agreement is impossible, you never have to compromise. And, since politics isn\u0026rsquo;t about compromise, it\u0026rsquo;s just about outnumbering your competition by any means necessary and obstructing them at every turn when they outnumber you. There is comfort in the idea that people are just fundamentally different, and that they owe each other nothing.\n[\u0026hellip;] the Democrats\u0026rsquo; desire for compromise is a weakness that can be exploited. On a gut level, the Right knows what debate means on the Left, knows that the Left wants to meet in the middle. So all they have to do is bait the Left into having the discussion on their terms and then keep insisting they should find common ground. \u0026ldquo;You could work with us if you\u0026rsquo;d only try a little harder.\u0026rdquo; Because the rules of that debate, where you concede points and look for compromise, in their world, make the Left look weak. As long as the Right controls the terms of debate, conciliatory loses.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how they control the conversation: move the entire debate to their framework using a bad argument as the worm on the hook.\nBibliography References Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Control the Conversation.” Tumblr.

In short: tolerance and forgiveness aren\u0026rsquo;t easy and if they feel easy then you\u0026rsquo;re likely not actually tolerating or forgiving but rather remarking \u0026ldquo;No harm done.\u0026rdquo;\nThoughts Tolerance of intolerance Regarding the bit about Brendan Eich1:\nThink of Brendan Eich as a member of a tiny religious minority surrounded by people who hate that minority. Suddenly firing him doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\nPerhaps I\u0026rsquo;m either (1) misinterpreting Scott Alexander here or (2) showing my tribal bias too blatantly but this reads as:\nThink of the persecutor as a member of the persecuted. Suddenly resisting them doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\nHot take: Political beliefs aren\u0026rsquo;t just an intellectual exercise \u0026ndash; they have consequences. Resisting the expansion of power by those who hold incompatible political opinions is a reasonable course of action.\nAnd if you mix together the open-source tech industry and the parallel universe where you can\u0026rsquo;t wear a FreeBSD t-shirt without risking someone trying to exorcise you, you can prove that Christians are scary and very powerful people who are persecuting everyone else all the time, and you have a great excuse for kicking one of the few people willing to affiliate with the Red Tribe, a guy who never hurt anyone, out of town.\nWhen a friend of mine heard Eich got fired, she didn\u0026rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. \u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except intolerance,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Intolerance\u0026rdquo; is starting to look like another one of those words like \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.\u0026rdquo; Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound quite so noble now, does it?\n[link added]\nI take exception with \u0026ldquo;a guy who never hurt anyone\u0026rdquo; which is only true in the sense that I don\u0026rsquo;t know of Eich every assaulting anyone. However, support for anti-same-sex marriage legislation does hurt people.\nBlue and red tribes I\u0026rsquo;m not sure Red and Blue tribes (which seem to approximate Rural and Urban americans) are the ultimate definition but I agree that they\u0026rsquo;re a better clustering tool than Republican and Democrat. That is, two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Blue tribe (as opposed to Red tribe) are more likely, in my opinion, than two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Democrat (as opposed to Republican).\nNotes So what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don\u0026rsquo;t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you\u0026rsquo;ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.\nThe people who are actually into this sort of thing sketch out a bunch of speculative tribes and subtribes, but to make it easier, let me stick with two and a half.\nThe Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting \u0026ldquo;USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!\u0026rdquo;, and listening to country music.\nThe Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to \u0026ldquo;everything except country\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd my hypothesis, stated plainly, is that if you\u0026rsquo;re part of the Blue Tribe, then your outgroup isn\u0026rsquo;t al-Qaeda, or Muslims, or blacks, or gays, or transpeople, or Jews, or atheists – it\u0026rsquo;s the Red Tribe.\nMy hunch – both the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe, for whatever reason, identify \u0026ldquo;America\u0026rdquo; with the Red Tribe. Ask people for typically \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; things, and you end up with a very Red list of characteristics – guns, religion, barbecues, American football, NASCAR, cowboys, SUVs, unrestrained capitalism.\nThat means the Red Tribe feels intensely patriotic about \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; country, and the Blue Tribe feels like they\u0026rsquo;re living in fortified enclaves deep in hostile territory.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOn both sides, \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; can be either a normal demonym, or a code word for a member of the Red Tribe.\nBut I think the situation with \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; is much the same as the situation with \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.\nBibliography References “Brendan Eich.” 2022.

NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderCanTolerateAnythingOutgroup2014 On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation. The appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s past political donations – specifically, a 2008 donation of \\$1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the banning of same-sex marriage in California, and donations in the amount of \\$2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom McClintock between 2008 and 2010. The Wall Street Journal initially reported that, in protest against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff) stepped down, leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert. CNET later reported that of the three board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Lilly told The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;I left rather than appoint him\u0026rdquo;, and declined to elaborate further.\nOn March 26, 2014, Eich expressed \u0026ldquo;sorrow for causing pain\u0026rdquo; and pledged to \u0026ldquo;work with LGBT communities and allies\u0026rdquo; at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about Eich\u0026rsquo;s donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link to continue with Firefox). CREDO Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich resign.\nAfter 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla over his opposition to same-sex marriage. In his personal blog, he posted, \u0026ldquo;under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader\u0026rdquo;. Mozilla made a press release saying that board members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.\n(“Brendan Eich” 2022)\n\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e; ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/0a065f64-1e20-4bbf-8c4b-2a60415bdb43/","summary":"Scott Alexander, (NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderCanTolerateAnythingOutgroup2014)\nSummary A meditation on what it means to be tolerant.

The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived. Sometimes the dragon would devour these unfortunate souls upon arrival; sometimes again it would lock them up in the mountain where they would wither away for months or years before eventually being consumed.\nThe misery inflicted by the dragon tyrant was incalculable. In addition to the ten thousand who were gruesomely slaughtered each day, there were the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, children, and friends who were left behind to grieve the loss of their departed loved ones.\nSome people tried to fight the dragon, but whether they were brave or foolish was difficult to say. Priests and magicians called down curses, to no avail. Warriors, armed with roaring courage and the best weapons the smiths could produce, attacked it, but were incinerated by its fire before coming close enough to strike. Chemists concocted toxic brews and tricked the dragon into swallowing them, but the only apparent effect was to further stimulate its appetite. The dragon\u0026rsquo;s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armour so impregnable, and its whole nature so robust, as to make it invincible to any human assault.\nSeeing that defeating the tyrant was impossible, humans had no choice but to obey its commands and pay the grisly tribute. The fatalities selected were always elders. Although senior people were as vigorous and healthy as the young, and sometimes wiser, the thinking was that they had at least already enjoyed a few decades of life. The wealthy might gain a brief reprieve by bribing the press gangs that came to fetch them, but, by constitutional law, nobody, not even the king himself, could put off their turn indefinitely.\nSpiritual men sought to comfort those who were afraid of being eaten by the dragon (which included almost everyone, although many denied it in public) by promising another life after death, a life that would be free from the dragon scourge. Other orators argued that the dragon had its place in the natural order and a moral right to be fed. They said it was part of the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s stomach. Others still maintained that the dragon was good for the human species because it kept the population size down. To what extent these arguments convinced the worried souls is not known. Most people tried to cope by not thinking about the grim end that awaited them.\nFor many centuries this desperate state of affairs continued. Nobody kept count any longer of the cumulative death toll, nor of the number of tears shed by the bereft. Expectations had gradually adjusted and the dragon tyrant had become a fact of life. In view of the evident futility of resistance, attempts to kill the dragon had ceased. Instead, efforts now focused on placating it. Although the dragon would occasionally raid the cities, it was found that the punctual delivery to the mountain of its quota of life reduced the frequency of these incursions.\nKnowing that their turn to become dragon fodder was always impending, people began having children earlier and more often. It was not uncommon for a girl to be pregnant by her sixteenth birthday. Couples often spawned a dozen children. The human population was thus kept from shrinking, and the dragon was kept from going hungry.\nOver the course of these centuries, the dragon, being well fed, slowly but steadily grew bigger. It had become almost as large as the mountain on which it lived and its appetite had increased proportionately. Ten thousand human bodies were no longer enough to fill its belly. It now demanded eighty thousand, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.\nWhat occupied the king\u0026rsquo;s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself was the logistics of collecting and transporting so many people to the mountain every day. This was not an easy task.\nTo facilitate the process, the king had a railway track constructed: two straight lines of glistening steel leading up to the dragon\u0026rsquo;s abode. Every twenty minutes, a train would arrive at the mountain terminal crammed with people, and would return empty. On moonlit nights, the passengers travelling on this train, if there had been windows for them to stick their heads out of, would have been able to see in front of them the double silhouette of the dragon and the mountain, and two glowing red eyes, like the beams from a pair of giant lighthouses, pointing the way to annihilation.\nServants were employed by the king in large numbers to administer the tribute. There were registrars who kept track of whose turn it was to be sent. There were people collectors who would be dispatched in special carts to fetch the designated people. Often travelling at breakneck speed, they would rush their cargo either to a railway station or directly to the mountain. There were clerks who administered the pensions paid to the decimated families who were no longer able to support themselves. There were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon, trying to ease their anguish with spirits and drugs.\nThere was, moreover, a cadre of dragonologists, who studied how these logistical processes could be made more efficient. Some dragonologists also conducted studies of the dragon\u0026rsquo;s physiology and behaviour, and collected samples—its shed scales, the slime that drooled from its jaws, its lost teeth, and its excrements, which were specked with fragments of human bone. All these items were painstakingly annotated and archived. The more the beast was understood, the more the general perception of its invincibility was confirmed. Its black scales, in particular, were harder than any material known to man, and there seemed no way to make as much as a scratch in its armour.\nTo finance all these activities, the king levied heavy taxes on his people. Dragon related expenditures, already accounting for one seventh of the economy, were growing even faster than the dragon itself.\nHumanity is a curious species. Every once in a while, somebody gets a good idea. Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements. Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed. Some of these devices—calculators, thermometers, microscopes, and the glass vials that the chemists use to boil and distil liquids—serve to make it easier to generate and try out new ideas, including ideas that expedite the process of idea generation.\nThus the great wheel of invention, which had turned at an almost imperceptibly slow pace in the older ages, gradually began to accelerate.\nSages predicted that a day would come when technology would enable humans to fly and do many other astonishing things. One of the sages, who was held in high esteem by some of the other sages but whose eccentric manners had made him a social outcast and recluse, went so far as to predict that technology would eventually make it possible to build a contraption that could kill the dragon tyrant.\nThe king\u0026rsquo;s scholars, however, dismissed these ideas. They said that humans were far too heavy to fly and in any case lacked feathers. As for the impossible notion that the dragon tyrant could be killed, history books recounted hundreds of attempts to do just that, not one of which had been successful. \u0026ldquo;We all know that this man had some irresponsible ideas,\u0026rdquo; a scholar of letters later wrote in his obituary of the reclusive sage who had by then been sent off to be devoured by the beast whose demise he had foretold, \u0026ldquo;but his writings were quite entertaining and perhaps we should be grateful to the dragon for making possible the interesting genre of dragon bashing literature which reveals so much about the culture of angst!\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, the wheel of invention kept turning. Mere decades later, humans did fly and accomplished many other astonishing things.\nA few iconoclastic dragonologists began arguing for a new attack on the dragon tyrant. Killing the dragon would not be easy, they said, but if some material could be invented that was harder than the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour, and if this material could be fashioned into some kind of projectile, then maybe the feat would be possible. At first, the iconoclasts\u0026rsquo; ideas were rejected by their dragonologist peers on grounds that no known material was harder than dragon scales. But after working on the problem for many years, one of the iconoclasts succeeded in demonstrating that a dragon scale could be pierced by an object made of a certain composite material. Many dragonologists who had previously been sceptical now joined the iconoclasts. Engineers calculated that a huge projectile could be made of this material and launched with sufficient force to penetrate the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour.\nThe manufacture of the needed quantity of the composite material would, however, be expensive.\nA group of several eminent engineers and dragonologists sent a petition to the king asking for funding to build the antidragon projectile. At the time when the petition was sent, the king was preoccupied with leading his army into war against a tiger. The tiger had killed a farmer and subsequently disappeared into the jungle. There was widespread fear in the countryside that the tiger might come out and strike again. The king had the jungle surrounded and ordered his troops to begin slashing their way through it. At the conclusion of the campaign, the king could announce that all 163 tigers in the jungle, including presumably the murderous one, had been hunted down and killed. During the tumult of the war, however, the petition had been lost or forgotten.\nThe petitioners therefore sent another appeal. This time they received a reply from one of the king\u0026rsquo;s secretaries saying that the king would consider their request after he was done reviewing the annual dragon administration budget. This year\u0026rsquo;s budget was the largest to date and included funding for a new railway track to the mountain. A second track was deemed necessary, as the original track could no longer support the increasing traffic. (The tribute demanded by the dragon tyrant had increased to one hundred thousand human beings, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.) When the budget was finally approved, however, reports were coming from a remote part of the country that a village was suffering from a rattlesnake infestation. The king had to leave urgently to mobilise his army and ride off to defeat this new threat. The antidragonists\u0026rsquo; appeal was filed away in a dusty cabinet in the castle basement.\nThe antidragonists met again to decide what was to be done. The debate was animated and continued long into the night. It was almost daybreak when they finally resolved to take the matter to the people. Over the following weeks, they travelled around the country, gave public lectures, and explained their proposal to anyone who would listen. At first, people were sceptical. They had been taught in school that the dragon tyrant was invincible and that the sacrifices it demanded had to be accepted as a fact of life. Yet when they learnt about the new composite material and about the designs for the projectile, many became intrigued. In increasing numbers, citizens flocked to the antidragonist lectures. Activists started organising public rallies in support of the proposal.\nWhen the king read about these meetings in the newspaper, he summoned his advisors and asked them what they thought about them. They informed him about the petitions that had been sent but told him that the antidragonists were troublemakers whose teachings were causing public unrest. It was much better for the social order, they said, that the people accepted the inevitability of the dragon tyrant tribute. The dragon administration provided many jobs that would be lost if the dragon was slaughtered. There was no known social good coming from the conquest of the dragon. In any case, the king\u0026rsquo;s coffers were currently nearly empty after the two military campaigns and the funding set aside for the second railway line. The king, who was at the time enjoying great popularity for having vanquished the rattlesnake infestation, listened to his advisors\u0026rsquo; arguments but worried that he might lose some of his popular support if he was seen to ignore the antidragonist petition. He therefore decided to hold an open hearing. Leading dragonologists, ministers of the state, and interested members of the public were invited to attend.\nThe meeting took place on the darkest day of the year, just before the Christmas holidays, in the largest hall of the royal castle. The hall was packed to the last seat and people were crowding in the aisles. The mood was charged with an earnest intensity normally reserved for pivotal wartime sessions.\nAfter the king had welcomed everyone, he gave the floor to the leading scientist behind the antidragonist proposal, a woman with a serious, almost stern expression on her face. She proceeded to explain in clear language how the proposed device would work and how the requisite amount of the composite material could be manufactured. Given the requested amount of funding, it should be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years. With an even greater amount of funding, it might be possible to do it in as little as twelve years. There could, however, be no absolute guarantee that it would work. The crowd followed her presentation intently.\nNext to speak was the king\u0026rsquo;s chief advisor for morality, a man with a booming voice that easily filled the auditorium.\n\u0026ldquo;Let us grant that this woman is correct about the science and that the project is technologically possible, although I don\u0026rsquo;t think that has actually been proven. Now she desires that we get rid of the dragon. Presumably, she thinks she\u0026rsquo;s got the right not to be chewed up by the dragon. How wilful and presumptuous. The finitude of human life is a blessing for every individual, whether he knows it or not. Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem like such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our human dignity. The preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realising more fully the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive. It is debasing, yes debasing, for a person to want to continue his or her mediocre life for as long as possible without worrying about some of the higher questions about what life is to be used for. But I tell you, the nature of the dragon is to eat humans, and our own species specified nature is truly and nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten by it\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe audience listened respectfully to this highly decorated speaker. The phrases were so eloquent that it was hard to resist the feeling that some deep thoughts must lurk behind them, although nobody could quite grasp what they were. Surely, words coming from such a distinguished appointee of the king must have profound substance.\nThe speaker next in line was a spiritual sage who was widely respected for his kindness and gentleness as well as for his devotion. As he strode to the podium, a small boy yelled out from the audience: \u0026ldquo;The dragon is bad!\u0026rdquo;\nThe boy\u0026rsquo;s parents turned bright red and began hushing and scolding the child. But the sage said: \u0026ldquo;Let the boy speak. He is probably wiser than an old fool like me.\u0026rdquo;\nAt first, the boy was too scared and confused to move but when he saw the genuinely friendly smile on the sage\u0026rsquo;s face and the outreached hand, he obediently took it and followed the sage up to the podium. \u0026ldquo;Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a brave little man,\u0026rdquo; said the sage. \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid of the dragon?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want my granny back,\u0026rdquo; said the boy.\n\u0026ldquo;Did the dragon take your granny away?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; the boy said, tears welling up in his large frightened eyes. \u0026ldquo;Granny promised that she would teach me how to bake gingerbread cookies for Christmas. She said that we would make a little house out of gingerbread and little gingerbread men that would live in it. Then those people in white clothes came and took Granny away to the dragon\u0026hellip;The dragon is bad and it eats people…I want my Granny back!\u0026rdquo;\nAt this point the child was crying so hard that the sage had to return him to his parents.\nThere were several other speakers that evening, but the child\u0026rsquo;s simple testimony had punctured the rhetorical balloon that the king\u0026rsquo;s ministers had tried to inflate. The people were backing the antidragonists, and by the end of the evening even the king had come to recognise the reason and the humanity of their cause. In his closing statement, he simply said: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the news spread, celebrations erupted in the streets. Those who had been campaigning for the antidragonists toasted each other and drank to the future of humanity.\nThe next morning, a billion people woke up and realised that their turn to be sent to the dragon would come before the projectile would be completed. A tipping point was reached. Whereas before, active support for the antidragonist cause had been limited to a small group of visionaries, it now became the number one priority and concern on everybody\u0026rsquo;s mind. The abstract notion of \u0026ldquo;the general will\u0026rdquo; took on an almost tangible intensity and concreteness. Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase the level of state support. The king responded to these appeals. In his New Year address, he announced that he would pass an extra appropriations bill to support the project at a high level of funding; additionally, he would sell off his summer castle and some of his land and make a large personal donation. \u0026ldquo;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon tyrant.\u0026rdquo;\nThus started a great technological race against time. The concept of an antidragon projectile was simple, but to make it a reality required solutions to a thousand smaller technical problems, each of which required dozens of time consuming steps and missteps. Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction. In one tragic accident, a wayward missile landed on a hospital and killed several hundred patients and staff. Now, however, there was a real seriousness of purpose, and the tests continued even as the corpses were being dug out from the debris.\nDespite almost unlimited funding and round the clock work by the technicians, the king\u0026rsquo;s deadline could not be met. The decade concluded and the dragon was still alive and well. The effort, however, was getting closer. A prototype missile had been successfully test fired. Production of the core, made of the expensive composite material, was on schedule for its completion to coincide with the finishing of the fully tested and debugged missile shell into which it was to be loaded. The launch date was set to be the following year\u0026rsquo;s New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, exactly twelve years after the project\u0026rsquo;s official inauguration. The best selling Christmas gift that year was a calendar that counted down the days to time zero, the proceeds going to the projectile project.\nThe king had undergone a personal transformation from his earlier frivolous and thoughtless self. He now spent as much time as he could in the laboratories and the manufacturing plants, encouraging the workers, and praising their toil. Sometimes he would bring a sleeping bag and spend the night on a noisy machine floor. He even studied and tried to understand the technical aspects of their work. Yet he confined himself to giving moral support and refrained from meddling in technical and managerial matters.\nSeven days before New Year, the woman who had made the case for the project almost twelve years earlier, and was now its chief executive, came to the royal castle and requested an urgent audience with the king. When the king got her note, he excused himself to the foreign dignitaries whom he was reluctantly entertaining at the annual Christmas dinner and hurried off to the private room where the scientist was waiting. As always of late, she looked pale and worn from her long working hours. This evening, however, the king also thought he could detect a ray of relief and satisfaction in her eyes.\nShe told him that the missile had been deployed, the core had been loaded, everything had been triple checked, they were ready to launch, and would the king give his final go ahead. The king sank down in an armchair and closed his eyes. He was thinking hard. By launching the projectile tonight, one week early, seven hundred thousand people would be saved. Yet if something went wrong, if it missed its target and hit the mountain instead, it would be a disaster. A new core would have to be constructed from scratch and the project would be set back by some four years. He sat there, silently, for almost an hour. Just as the scientist had become convinced that he had fallen asleep, he opened his eyes and said in a firm voice: \u0026ldquo;No. I want you to go right back to the lab. I want you to check and then recheck everything again.\u0026rdquo; The scientist could not help a sigh escaping her; but she nodded and left.\nThe last day of the year was cold and overcast, but there was no wind, which meant good launch conditions. The sun was setting. Technicians were scuttling around making the final adjustments and giving everything one last check. The king and his closest advisors were observing from a platform close to the launch pad. Further away, behind a fence, large numbers of the public had assembled to witness the great event. A large clock was showing the countdown: fifty minutes to go.\nAn advisor tapped the king on the shoulder and drew his attention to the fence. There was some tumult. Somebody had apparently jumped the fence and was running toward the platform where the king sat. Security quickly caught up with him. He was handcuffed and taken away. The king turned his attention back to the launch pad, and to the mountain in the background. In front of it, he could see the dark slumped profile of the dragon. It was eating.\nSome twenty minutes later, the king was surprised to see the handcuffed man reappearing a short distance from the platform. His nose was bleeding and he was accompanied by two security guards. The man appeared to be in frenzied state. When he spotted the king, he began shouting at the top of his lungs: \u0026ldquo;The last train! The last train! Stop the last train!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who is this young man?\u0026rdquo; said the king. \u0026ldquo;His face seems familiar, but I cannot quite place him. What does he want? Let him come up.\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation, and the reason for his frenzy was that he had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain. The king had ordered the train traffic to continue, fearing that any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and leave the open field in front of the mountain where it now spent most of its time. The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train, which was due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot do it,\u0026rdquo; said the king, \u0026ldquo;I cannot take the risk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the trains frequently run five minutes late. The dragon won\u0026rsquo;t notice! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was kneeling before the king, imploring him to save his father\u0026rsquo;s life and the lives of the other thousand passengers onboard that last train.\nThe king looked down at the pleading, bloodied face of the young man, but he bit his lip, and shook his head. The young man continued to wail even as the guards carried him off the platform: \u0026ldquo;Please! Stop the last train! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stood silent and motionless, until, after a while, the wailing suddenly ceased. The king looked up and glanced over at the countdown clock: five minutes remaining.\nFour minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.\nThe last technician left the launch pad.\n30 seconds. 20 seconds. Ten, nine, eight…\nAs a ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out, the spectators instinctively rose to the tips of their toes, and all eyes fixated at the front end of the white flame from the rocket\u0026rsquo;s afterburners, heading towards the distant mountain. The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, it was as if at this moment they shared a single awareness, a single conscious experience: that white flame, shooting into the dark, embodying the human spirit, its fear and its hope…striking at the heart of evil. The silhouette on the horizon tumbled, and fell. A thousand voices of pure joy rose from the assembled masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn out thud from the collapsing monster as if the Earth itself was drawing a sigh of relief. After centuries of oppression, humanity at last was free from the cruel tyranny of the dragon.\nThe joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant: \u0026ldquo;Long live the king! Long live us all!\u0026rdquo; The king\u0026rsquo;s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: \u0026ldquo;We did it! We did it!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king, however, answered in a broken voice: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late? This could have been done five, maybe ten years ago! Millions of people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had to die.\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stepped off the platform and walked up to the young man in handcuffs, who was sitting on the ground. There he fell down on his knees. \u0026ldquo;Forgive me! Oh my God, please forgive me!\u0026rdquo;\nBibliography References Bostrom, N. 2005. “The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant.” Journal of Medical Ethics 31 (5): 273–77. https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2004.009035.

Most important, you feel internal or external pressure to begin and have some level of confidence about the task\u0026rsquo;s overall direction.\n[Negatives]\nThe initial information given with a task may not be conducive to understanding it immediately. Tasks may be vague in their definition. Just by starting a task, you do not guarantee that you can figure it out and complete it. You can waste time fumbling through starting the task without a clear idea what you need to do. While you are starting one task, you are putting off other tasks. Some organizations may punish initiative. You may be afraid to start. [Positives]\nBy not starting a task, you do not know whether you can complete it. If you do not start a task, you cannot complete it. Starting something new can be satisfying and give you a sense of accomplishment. Therefore, when faced with a vague task, start working on it to see if the steps you need to complete it emerge.\nCommentary\nProcrastination is the enemy of a busy person.\nResulting Context Examples Contiguous time blocks Related: Deep work\nYou have the information you need to complete a task and you are determining how you will complete it.

It is not always possible to obtain contiguous time blocks. [Positives]\nComplex tasks require a certain amount of think time to be completed. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated. Smaller allocated time blocks create interruptions that cause you to stop and re-start a task. Therefore, set aside a block of time to complete the task so that you are able to perform the task without interruption until you are comfortable with how the task is progressing.\nCommentary\nThis is a pattern about limiting interruptions so that you can concentrate on a complex task. Interruptions can come in at least two forms: Those you impose upon yourself through fragmenting your time and those that outside forces impose upon you. Even though there is a potential task re-start penalty when you impose interruptions upon yourself, there is a quantifiable task re-start consequence when outside influences interrupt you. When you interrupt yourself, you typically do it at a logical break point – a time when you feel comfortable you can stop the task. When outside influences cause an interruption, however, your concentration on a complex problem is broken and you need to re-establish it to continue.\nResulting Context\nBe careful not to take this pattern to an extreme. If you completely de-fragment your time, you will be unable to complete important tasks that may have an earlier due date because you will not interrupt yourself to address them.\nExamples Single-Task important items You have a task to do that you and/or others consider important. Performing this task simultaneously with other tasks breaks your concentration and you find that quality is suffering. You feel that the task warrants a quality level that is impossible to produce if you perform it with other tasks.\n[Negatives]\nInterruptions are an unpleasant fact. It is often impossible to find time to work on only one thing because of pressure from others though in-person visits, email, IM, telephone calls, or pages. Single tasking does not guarantee that the results will be better than if you multitasked. When you perform a single task, you may be putting off tasks that are more important or time critical. [Positives]\nImportant tasks, like complex tasks, require a certain amount of think time to be completed. What makes an important task different from a complex task is there is a need to attend to details – the output is important. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated and produce work that is not befitting the task. Working on one important task may help you solve another complex problem. When you fragment your time by completing multiple tasks in the same time block, you decrease the amount of concentration and attention you can give to an important task. There is a certain level of satisfaction knowing that you are producing high quality results. Therefore, isolate important tasks and perform them separately so that you have the ability to concentrate and produce high quality output in the required amount of time.\nCommentary\nThis pattern is different from Contiguous Time Blocks. Single-Task Important Items does not refer to blocking off time for a task, but refers to concentration on a single important task at a time.\nResulting Context Examples Put it off You have a task to complete and you are having trouble concentrating on it either because it is complex, you are fatigued, or it is large. You find that you are having difficulty advancing the task or that the task itself is becoming more confusing. Most important, you feel you do not have a good handle on how to organize the task, its output, or both.\n[Negatives]\nProcrastination can make a task more difficult to complete. When you are extremely fatigued, setting aside a task or sleeping may or may not help you organize your thoughts. It may not be possible to put it off certain tasks due to pressure to complete a task. Putting a task off might not result in a better organization or output. [Positives]\nWhen you have trouble concentrating, the work you are trying to complete takes longer. When you have trouble concentrating, quality suffers. Complex (or boring) tasks drain your mental resources. Setting a problem aside gives your mind time to mull over the information it has already absorbed while you are doing other things. By better organizing a task or its output, it may become easier complete. Therefore, when faced with poor concentration on a boring or complex task with a somewhat flexible deadline, stop working on it temporarily so you can collect your thoughts. It may help to sleep on the problem and begin working it anew once you awaken.\nCommentary Resulting Context\nIf you put something off that will not benefit from downtime thinking, you are essentially procrastinating – an alternate, less appealing resulting context. In addition, it is possible for you to think you can put something down in order to organize your thoughts, but if there is no plan to return to it, it is probably procrastination.\nExamples Seek clarification You have a task to complete which is vague or has vague instructions. The task may have an aggressive deadline. Just starting the task to learn its direction does not appear to be an option. Most significant, you feel that you cannot begin the task unless you have clear instructions or you obtain additional information.\n[Negatives]\nBy requesting clarification, you could irritate the individual or organization giving the task (discretion and politeness is required). The time used to clarify a task may take away from the time you have to complete it. Some organizations view asking for help as a sign of weakness and discourage people from seeking clarification. [Positives]\nWhen a timed task is vague, you need to determine what is truly required quickly. Vague tasks take a lot of time to figure out and you could be wrong if you guess. The amount of time taken to complete a vague task takes away from other tasks. Obtaining clarification may help you organize your thoughts and identify the information you require to complete it. Therefore, ask the requestor for clarification so that you can focus on completing the task.\nCommentary Resulting Context\nSeeking clarification can backfire. This depends on the personality of the person who gives you the task and, in some cases, their power and authority. If the person giving a task believes you should know how to complete it, rather than gaining additional information to perform the task you will irritate them and perhaps lose their trust in your competence.\nExamples Batch the simple stuff You have many tasks to complete and a number of them are relatively small. The tasks relate to each other. You have a sense that you are not making much progress and you have a block of time to invest in completing small, simple tasks.\n[Negative]\nIf too much time is spent clearing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. The priority of small tasks may not let you batch them together. Small tasks may require input from others and not lend themselves to batching. Many small tasks can be similar to (or more complex than) a large task. [Positive]\nSmaller tasks take less time to complete. Removing things from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Grouping similar small tasks into task groups may reduce the amount of total time required to complete them. Therefore, when faced with many small tasks, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and an available block of time, batch these tasks together.\nCommentary Resulting Context\nPerhaps the most harmful alternative resulting context for this pattern is if you decide to batch simple stuff instead of completing larger and more important tasks. Though you may gain some satisfaction in completing these smaller items, when a task is unimportant, you should consider using a Task Jar instead.\nExamples Task jar You have many tasks to complete and some of them are relatively small, well known, and not urgent. You also have several larger tasks, which require larger blocks of time or are complex. You do not have a block of time to complete these small tasks, but there is time available between other more important or larger tasks.\n[Negatives]\nIf you dedicate too much time to completing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. Stopping large tasks to complete other smaller tasks can cause both to take longer. Simpler tasks may take more time than is available between larger or more complex tasks.\n[Positives]\nSmall tasks do not take a long time to complete. Removing items from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Using the time between tasks to complete other tasks can free your mind temporarily before you begin the next larger or more complex task. There is no advantage to doing small tasks together that do not have any affinity. Therefore, when faced with many small non-urgent tasks that do not have any affinity, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and no dedicated block of time to complete them, intersperse simple tasks throughout the day in between larger or more complex tasks.\nCommentary\nTasks should be well known; no need to Seek Clarification Related: Batch the Simple Stuff Drop Unimportant Tasks Resulting Context\nUsing a \u0026ldquo;task jar\u0026rdquo; allows you to intersperse small, well-known, non-urgent tasks between larger or more complex tasks.\nExamples Strike when you are hot You have a task to do and need to progress through it quickly or make significant progress. You have times of the day when you feel you are more productive – times when you are at your intellectual, emotional, or physical best. To make significant progress or complete the task, you feel that you need to be at your best to maintain your focus..\n[Negatives]\nOther tasks or outside influences may interfere with your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time. \u0026ldquo;Hot\u0026rdquo; times can occur at bizarre hours (e.g. in the middle of the night) which, if used, can affect your performance afterward. Using your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time to complete small tasks may or may not be the best use of that time. You may not be able to control the schedule of a task so that you complete it when you are hot. Just because you are at your mental best does not mean you will be able to concentrate. You may not know when your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time is. [Positives]\nEveryone has a time of day where they are at their intellectual, emotional, and physical best. Completing tasks when you are at your best can reduce the amount of time it takes to complete it. When you are at your best, you may be more efficient. Therefore, when you have a need to move quickly through many smaller tasks or make significant progress on larger tasks, take advantage of the time of day when you are most productive by striking when you are hot.\nCommentary\nThis pattern has its basis in our human biology. People seem to have times of day (not all the same) that they are better at completing tasks than others. For some, it is several different times a day. It has been suggested that the frequency could be as much as every 90-110 minutes. The circadian rhythm is another such biological clock.\nResulting Context Examples Feedback loop Related: Agile, Leo Babauta | Reset Ritual to Come Back to Focus\nYou have a task and are unable to determine how long it will take to complete. You have the information you need to begin the task, but you believe there will be additional information requirements that may emerge as you perform the task. The task itself may be vague, but you do not require clarification. You feel that you need some knowledge of the task\u0026rsquo;s parts to determine how long it will take to complete.\n[Negatives]\nSetting a target does not mean you will achieve it. You may not correctly estimate the duration of a task and waste more time having to stop the task and pick it up again after you assess your results. Completing a portion of the task may not give you any information about other pieces of the task. Unknown duration tasks can be disconcerting. [Positives]\nIt is often easier to break tasks down into sub-tasks. Gathering information about how long it takes you to complete a step can give you valuable information on how long it will take to complete the next step (or the entire task). Completing a task in tight feedback cycles may improve the overall quality of the deliverable. Therefore, when you are uncertain how long a task is going to take, set a target for how much you expect to complete by a certain time. By setting a target, you will give yourself a point in time where you can check your progress. When you reach the target, you can check the amount of work you completed and then adjust your timeline to reflect how long you are taking.\nCommentary Resulting Context Examples Prioritize Related: Drop Unimportant Tasks\nYou have many tasks to complete. These tasks can be large and complex or small and simple. You have the information you need to decide which tasks are more important. Each task has a different level of importance to you or someone for whom you are completing it.\n[Negatives]\nSometimes, seemingly unimportant tasks are important. Often tasks originate from many different people. It is difficult to obtain general agreement from them about the relative important of all of your tasks. You have to be the judge. Sometimes the relationship between someone else\u0026rsquo;s goals and a task you are completing is not obvious. Prioritizing your work may cause you to focus on things you think are important versus what others think are important. [Positives]\nA task\u0026rsquo;s level of importance is somewhat dependent upon its proximity to completion (when it is due). Tasks typically have different levels of importance. Putting the most important tasks first ensures that high value tasks are given more attention than low value tasks. Therefore, when you have several tasks with different levels of importance, prioritize the work from the most important task to the least important task. When you prioritize tasks, consider the importance of the person requesting the task; the due date of the task; the amount of time required to do the task; the relationship between the task and your goals; and the relationship between the task and the requestor\u0026rsquo;s goals. By ordering the tasks, you ensure that you do the most important tasks first.\nCommentary Resulting Context Examples Delegate You have a task to do for which you may not have the specific domain expertise and do not have the time to complete. You have people reporting to you or who are willing to help you complete the task. Others may be able to perform the task equal to or better than you.\n[Negatives]\nPeople may resent you dumping your work on them. Delegating an important task involves a measure of risk. People may not complete the task within the quality and time parameters you set. However, it may be GOOD ENOUGH. You can spend more time explaining a task to someone than you would spend doing the task yourself. [Positives]\nYou cannot complete everything yourself. People are usually willing to help. When you are busy, you cannot complete every task assigned to you and may need to Drop Unimportant Tasks. Therefore, when you are faced with a task that you are responsible to complete, but do not have specific domain expertise or time, but either have people reporting to you or have people that do have time, delegate the task. Never put off for tomorrow what you can have someone else do today.\nCommentary Resulting Context Examples Drop unimportant tasks You have several tasks you need to complete. Some of these tasks are unimportant and may never need action. The task may have been on the bottom of your list of things to do for a very long time and may no longer be required. In addition, you may have had past experience with the requestor and can judge whether it is truly required or not.\n[Negatives]\nHistory is not always a guide as to whether someone will need the results of a task. Tasks that are unimportant to you may be very important to someone else. A seemingly unimportant task may be a test to see if you can handle more important tasks. [Positives]\nUnderstanding busywork is an important component to determining whether to drop a task. Some tasks are just not worth doing (so do not do them). Therefore, when you receive an unimportant task whose completion will make no difference to anyone, drop the task. This is not an opportunity for slacking. Use this when you are overwhelmed and you are sure that the task will make no difference to anyone. This often requires very detailed knowledge of another person\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nCommentary Resulting Context Examples Good enough You have several tasks you need to complete. You know that not everything that you do has to be perfect. You recognize that the level of quality for a task can be reduced, and still satisfy the requestor. You may be spending time on things that add little value.\nThe best is the enemy of the good. (Voltaire, Dictionnaire Philosophique. Women, 1694-1778)\nYou may feel unsettled by not producing your best work.\nSome people want to produce a perfect product every time.\nTime spent perfecting something that does not require perfection is time that is lost to completing other tasks.\nThe requestor may expect perfect output even if the task does not warrant it.\nTherefore, reduce the level of quality to a level that will satisfy the requestor and meet their expectations. You can then complete the task more quickly. That is, you work on the task only until it is good enough. Different task outputs require different levels of perfection depending on some objective criteria and the requestors\u0026rsquo; expectations. If a task does not require a high level of precision or quality, it may be possible to put just enough effort into it to complete it.\nCommentary Resulting Context\nCompleting tasks so that they are \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; and satisfy the requestor allows you to devote time to those tasks that truly do need an element of perfection.\nExamples Acknowledgements About the Authors Appendix A: Pattern Language Reference Diagram Appendix B: Pattern Cross Reference Appendix C: Quick Access Table References Bibliography References Kile, James F., Donald J.

There are two key parts to this dilemma.\nValue to innovation is an S-curve [S-curve]: Improving a product takes time and many iterations. The first of these iterations provide minimal value to the customer but in time the base is created and the value increases exponentially. Once the base is created then each iteration is dramatically better than the last. At some point the most valuable improvements are complete and the value per iteration is minimal again. So in the middle is the most value, at the beginning and end the value is minimal. Incumbent sized deals: The incumbent has the luxury of a huge customer set but high expectations of yearly sales. New entry next generation products find niches away from the incumbent customer set to build the new product. The new entry companies do not require the yearly sales of the incumbent and thus have more time to focus and innovate on this smaller venture.

But I think there\u0026rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:\nYou are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune [Technologist] You are a maker. You build things for people to use We self-select into communities of our peers based on these ideals. We use coded language to express these ideals to our peers.\nI think each group has its own conferences, and its own subreddits. Its own programming languages, heroes and its own villains.\nNotes Programming as applied mathematics Source code: The source should read like poetry - dense, with very few lines of code needed to express an idea. Once understood, the terse program seems like a beautiful and obvious description of your program. It is more important that the source code is simple than the execution is simple or fast. High level languages are better than low level languages because they let you express your intent more clearly. Execution: How the program is executed by the computer is an implementation detail of the compiler. It is more important that the code is simple than the execution is fast. Correctness: A program is correct if it implements the spec exactly. The best programs use tools like Ada to formally prove correctness. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Beautiful code is more important than beautiful UI. Most (arguably all) of the modern advancements in programming languages come from people in this camp. If you\u0026rsquo;ve used React to make a website, you should know that the model of immutability and expressing your view as a pure function from data to DOM came from functional programming. Actually, most modern language features are invented by people who think of programming as thought. Years (or decades) later, those features get copied into the more popular languages and get treated as new ideas.\nProgramming as hardware hacking Source code: The code should be clean, but clean code is less important than a clean execution. Low level languages are often better than high level languages because you can be more explicit about what the computer will do when it executes your code. (Thus you have more room to optimize). Execution: How the computer executes your code is paramount. Programming without thinking about execution is just begging for slow performance. Correctness: A program is correct if it runs the way you expect it to run, given normal parameters. Execution elegance is more important than correctness. And if a theoretical issue can\u0026rsquo;t happen in practice due to how the machine works, its not a real bug. A program must be adequately fast to be considered correct. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Its ok to let the constraints of the hardware guide the user experience. To this community we owe almost all performance improvements in our computers, above and beyond what is demanded by customers. Nobody else cares about performance quite like people who think about the hardware all day. But if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about your computer as a machine, what greater ugliness can you inflict than pointless work?\nProgramming as a tool to make things Source code: The code should be clean, but only because cleaner code is easier to iterate on. Code cleanliness is less important than most other considerations. Execution: The program only has to be fast enough for the users. If you make it even faster, you\u0026rsquo;re taking time away from adding features that people care about more. Correctness: Bugs are bad only in proportion to their impact. The program should act the way the users expect it to act. UI: The UI is more important than anything else. Every other part of the program only exists in service to the user interface. I think most professional software engineers are in this tribe - which makes sense, because this is the place where it is easiest to make money writing software.\nIn my experience people in this camp are better at community. They seem to be much more positive and encouraging of new members, and willing to help. I guess its because you can tell if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job in the other two camps by simply taking a look yourself. If you make software for other humans, satisfaction comes from making the people around you happy.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel that this place is a touch soulless. Taken to the extreme, this world view doesn\u0026rsquo;t value the beauty in the engineering itself. Although you could probably make the opposite criticism against the other groups - they don\u0026rsquo;t value how their software can impact the world.\nAlso see Moloch.\nBibliography References Gentle, Joseph. 2017. “3 Tribes of Programming.” Seph. http://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/.

This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?\nMoloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis\u0026rsquo; question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?\nAnd Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. \u0026ldquo;Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Goddess answers: \u0026ldquo;What is the matter with that, if it\u0026rsquo;s what you want to do?\u0026rdquo;\nMalaclypse: \u0026ldquo;But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!\u0026rdquo;\nGoddess: \u0026ldquo;Oh. Well, then stop.\u0026rdquo;\nThe implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: \u0026ldquo;Moloch\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful not because it\u0026rsquo;s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn\u0026rsquo;t an agent.\nBostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.\nSo you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don\u0026rsquo;t everyone else will kill you, because if they don\u0026rsquo;t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to \u0026ldquo;everyone agrees to stop doing this at once\u0026rdquo;, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.\nExamples Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma Fish farming story As a thought experiment, let\u0026rsquo;s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.\nBut each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let\u0026rsquo;s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.\nA thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.\nBut one farmer (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.\nEveryone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he\u0026rsquo;s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.\nOnce four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying \u0026ldquo;Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone\u0026rsquo;s productivity goes down.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…\nA self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.\nMalthusian trap Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you\u0026rsquo;re one of those rats from The Rats of NIMH).\nYou live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there\u0026rsquo;s not enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.\nA certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back will go extinct within a few generations.\nIn fact, it\u0026rsquo;s not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out, swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.\nIf some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island\u0026rsquo;s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop the cycle (a) will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating anything is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.\nFor a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.\nCapitalism Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can\u0026rsquo;t, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nTwo-income trap It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.\nFrom a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get one will be left behind.\nAgriculture II A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t take it die out. Eventually, everyone\u0026rsquo;s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone\u0026rsquo;s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.\nThe right path? No. The only path? Yes.\nIII The Apocrypha Discordia says:\n\u0026ldquo;Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to be somewhere else when we reach the sea.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take this random gag 100% literally and see where it leads us.\nWe just analogized the flow of incentives to the flow of a river. The downhill trajectory is appropriate: the traps happen when you find an opportunity to trade off a useful value for greater competitiveness. Once everyone has it, the greater competitiveness brings you no joy – but the value is lost forever. Therefore, each step of the Poor Coordination Polka makes your life worse.\nBut not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move uphill surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons – excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization – plus one good reason – coordination.\nExcess resources (Moloch) The ocean depths are a horrible place with little light, few resources, and various horrible organisms dedicated to eating or parasitizing one another. But every so often, a whale carcass falls to the bottom of the sea. More food than the organisms that find it could ever possibly want. There\u0026rsquo;s a brief period of miraculous plenty, while the couple of creatures that first encounter the whale feed like kings. Eventually more animals discover the carcass, the faster-breeding animals in the carcass multiply, the whale is gradually consumed, and everyone sighs and goes back to living in a Malthusian death-trap.\nPhysical limitations (Moloch) Imagine a profit-maximizing slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves\u0026rsquo; productivity dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor – we assume the fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can – but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how mean you can get away with being. Thus, the \u0026ldquo;race to the bottom\u0026rdquo; stops somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits are run into.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo in this case, a race to the bottom where competing plantations become crueler and crueler to their slaves in order to maximize competitiveness is halted by the physical limitation of cruelty not helping after a certain point.\nUtility maximization (Moloch) We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking in terms of preserving values versus winning competitions, and expecting optimizing for the latter to destroy the former.\nBut many of the most important competitions / optimization processes in modern civilization are optimizing for human values. You win at capitalism partly by satisfying customers\u0026rsquo; values. You win at democracy partly by satisfying voters\u0026rsquo; values.\nSuppose there\u0026rsquo;s a coffee plantation somewhere in Ethiopia that employs Ethiopians to grow coffee beans that get sold to the United States. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s locked in a life-and-death struggle with other coffee plantations and want to throw as many values under the bus as it can to pick up a slight advantage.\nBut it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice quality of coffee produced too much, or else the Americans won\u0026rsquo;t buy it. And it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice wages or working conditions too much, or else the Ethiopians won\u0026rsquo;t work there. And in fact, part of its competition-optimization process is finding the best ways to attract workers and customers that it can, as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost them too much money. So this is very promising.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember exactly how fragile this beneficial equilibrium is.\nSuppose the coffee plantations discover a toxic pesticide that will increase their yield but make their customers sick. But their customers don\u0026rsquo;t know about the pesticide, and the government hasn\u0026rsquo;t caught up to regulating it yet. Now there\u0026rsquo;s a tiny uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;selling to Americans\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Americans\u0026rsquo; values\u0026rdquo;, and so of course Americans\u0026rsquo; values get thrown under the bus.\nOr suppose that there\u0026rsquo;s a baby boom in Ethiopia and suddenly there are five workers competing for each job. Now the company can afford to lower wages and implement cruel working conditions down to whatever the physical limits are. As soon as there\u0026rsquo;s an uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;getting Ethiopians to work here\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Ethiopian values\u0026rdquo;, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too good for Ethiopian values either.\nOr suppose someone invents a robot that can pick coffee better and cheaper than a human. The company fires all its laborers and throws them onto the street to die. As soon as the utility of the Ethiopians is no longer necessary for profit, all pressure to maintain it disappears.\nOr suppose that there is some important value that is neither a value of the employees or the customers. Maybe the coffee plantations are on the habitat of a rare tropical bird that environmentalist groups want to protect. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re on the ancestral burial ground of a tribe different from the one the plantation is employing, and they want it respected in some way. Maybe coffee growing contributes to global warming somehow. As long as it\u0026rsquo;s not a value that will prevent the average American from buying from them or the average Ethiopian from working for them, under the bus it goes.\nI know that \u0026ldquo;capitalists sometimes do bad things\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it\u0026rsquo;s not equivalent to \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo;. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they\u0026rsquo;re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter.\n(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very well and people who summarize him as \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo; are doing him a disservice)\nAnd as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it\u0026rsquo;s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there\u0026rsquo;s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus.\nFor example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling to do anything about them because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to look \u0026ldquo;soft on crime\u0026rdquo;, and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all over the airwaves as \u0026ldquo;Convict released by Congressman\u0026rsquo;s policies kills family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone claim he deserves reelection?\u0026rdquo;. So even if decreasing prison populations would be good policy – and it is – it will be very difficult to implement.\n(Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the stunned governments!)\nCoordination (Moloch) The opposite of a trap is a garden\nThings are easy to solve from a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse. An intense competition between agents has turned into a garden, with a single gardener dictating where everything should go and removing elements that do not conform to the pattern.\n[\u0026hellip;] government can easily solve the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the Prisoners\u0026rsquo; Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races within a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.\nThe two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there\u0026rsquo;s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.\nIV So I agree with Robin Hanson: This is the dream time. This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and science and philosophy and love can flourish.\nAs technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus\u0026rsquo; unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.\nContract Drafting Em\nThe last value we have to sacrifice is being anything at all, having the lights on inside. With sufficient technology we will be \u0026ldquo;able\u0026rdquo; to give up even the final spark.\n(Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!)\nEverything the human race has worked for – all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future – might be accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.\n(Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!)\nWe will break our back lifting Moloch to Heaven, but unless something changes it will be his victory and not ours.\nVII The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.\nAnd the whole point of Bostrom\u0026rsquo;s Superintelligence is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift something to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u0026rsquo;s on our side, it can kill Moloch dead.\nAnd if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to flourish unconstrained by natural law.\nVIII The Universe is a dark [Dark forest theory] and foreboding place, suspended between alien deities. Cthulhu, Gnon, Moloch, call them what you will.\nSomewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names. In the Kushiel books, his name was Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans.\nThe other gods sit on their dark thrones and think \u0026ldquo;Ha ha, a god who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!\u0026rdquo;\nBut somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a surprising number of unfortunate accidents.\nThere are many gods, but this one is ours.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?\nMy answer is: Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.\nHe always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.\nAs long as the offer\u0026rsquo;s open, it will be irresistible.

The reasoning behind all these choices is that we want to produce competent capable adults, and solving short term in-the-moment issues, while important, isn\u0026rsquo;t the goal.\nThoughts See Guidelines for parenting.\nNotes Never lie If kids ask a question and they aren\u0026rsquo;t ready to hear the answer, just tell them that. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to go into every gruesome detail, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to couch your answer at the level you think they\u0026rsquo;ll understand and that you have time for, but they\u0026rsquo;re smarter than you probably think.\nWin the series Every interaction is a repeated game, and your goal is not to win this one iteration, but to win the series. So if a child is crying because she wants something, even though it feels like a win to give in now (she stops crying which is better for everyone, you haven\u0026rsquo;t really given up much), it\u0026rsquo;s disastrous in the repeated game because she learns that she can get what she wants by crying.\nNever bluff If you threaten a consequence and don\u0026rsquo;t follow through, they\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out really quickly. Which leads to the following rule: be very careful with threats. If you make them, carry them out; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to carry out the threat, don\u0026rsquo;t make it.\nPraise the process We\u0026rsquo;re pretty particular in how we praise our kids. We try to use process praise (\u0026ldquo;I like the way you made up a story about all the parts of your drawing\u0026rdquo;), some amount of results praise (\u0026ldquo;That block tower is amazing! It\u0026rsquo;s so tall!\u0026rdquo;), and virtually zero person praise (\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a good artist/architect.\u0026rdquo;)\nAnswer questions with as much detail as they want I\u0026rsquo;ve had conversations with the kids about civil rights, affirmative action, religion, communism versus capitalism, consequences for breaking laws, race, sexuality, and so on. Not because I\u0026rsquo;ve set out to teach them that stuff, but because they ask lots of questions and I try to answer them. Kids are mostly concerned with concrete, day-to-day things \u0026ndash; but some of the best interactions come when they are in the right questioning mood, and you definitely want to take advantage of it.\nYou have to be age appropriate \u0026ndash; when talking about where babies come from, I don\u0026rsquo;t talk about penises in vaginas to a 5 year old \u0026ndash; but they can handle a lot more than most adults give them credit for.\nBibliography References Orr, Dave. n.d. “Parenting Rules.” Accessed March 14, 2022. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gapy2nLy4wysXSGL/parenting-rules.

For instance, Greenwald mentioned a scene in a hospital in which a nurse inflating a blood-pressure cuff originally said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to blow this up.\u0026rdquo; Greenwald recalls: \u0026ldquo;Fred made us redub the line, saying, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to puff this up with some air,\u0026rsquo; because \u0026lsquo;blow it up\u0026rsquo; might sound like there\u0026rsquo;s an explosion, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.\u0026rdquo;\nThe show\u0026rsquo;s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn\u0026rsquo;t air. And Rogers\u0026rsquo;s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet \u0026ldquo;to sleep,\u0026rdquo; he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.\nRogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children\u0026rsquo;s minds might go. For instance, in a scene in which an eye doctor uses an ophthalmoscope to peer into his eyes, he made a point of having the doctor clarify that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see Rogers\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. Rogers also wrote a song called \u0026ldquo;You Can Never Go Down the Drain,\u0026rdquo; because he knew that drains were something that, to kids, seemed to exist solely to suck things down.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:kingMisterRogersHadSimpleSetRulesTalkingChildren2018)\nIn 1977, about a decade into the show\u0026rsquo;s run, Arthur Greenwald and another writer named Barry Head cracked open a bottle of scotch while on a break, and coined the term Freddish. They later created an illustrated manual called \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Talk About Freddish,\u0026rdquo; a loving parody of the demanding process of getting all the words just right for Rogers. \u0026ldquo;What Fred understood and was very direct and articulate about was that the inner life of children was deadly serious to them,\u0026rdquo; Greenwald said.\nPer the pamphlet, there were nine steps for translating into Freddish:\n\u0026ldquo;State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms preschoolers can understand.\u0026rdquo; Example: It is dangerous to play in the street. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase in a positive manner,\u0026rdquo; as in It is good to play where it is safe. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.\u0026rdquo; As in, \u0026ldquo;Ask your parents where it is safe to play.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive.\u0026rdquo; In the example, that\u0026rsquo;d mean getting rid of \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo;: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;d be \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo;: Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.\u0026rdquo; Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow your advice.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; represents a value judgment, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea a ﬁnal time, relating it to some phase of development a preschooler can understand.\u0026rdquo; Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them, and listening is an important part of growing.

The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.\nBlack proposes converting work to play. I wonder: will all games have players?\nEven if we assume that all work could be gamified, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that everyone will want to play such games. I love games, and have spent way too much of my life playing them, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gone months and years without playing any games at all, and don\u0026rsquo;t see how being forced to play a game would be any better than being forced to work.\nAlso, its difficult to imagine how the most undesirable of jobs could be gamified. Who\u0026rsquo;s going to want to play the garbageman game? Or the fix the sewage system game?\nThe products and services of our modern world also requires sustained, multi-year efforts by trained specialists. Something like the mass production of medicine isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can just play with once in a while and still get it made in high enough quantities with serious quality control.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:pmoriartyVeLongBeenFanThisEssaySomethingStriveNext)\nPerhaps the answer is just more automation.\nNotes The alternative to work isn\u0026rsquo;t just idleness. To be ludic is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it\u0026rsquo;s never more rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called \u0026ldquo;leisure\u0026rdquo;; far from it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.\nThe Carrot is the Stick\nMany workers are fed up with work. There are high and rising rates of absenteeism, turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread among workers themselves is that work itself is inevitable and necessary.\nI disagree. It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand — and I think this is the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure — we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make them less enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.\nUnder a system of permanent revelry, we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put the Renaissance to shame. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any more jobs, just things to do and people to do them.\nBear in mind that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take today\u0026rsquo;s work just as we find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would have to be perverse indeed. If technology has a role in all this it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new realms for re/creation.\nWorkers of the world\u0026hellip; relax!\nWork makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren\u0026rsquo;t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.\nAnd so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.\nBibliography References Black, Bob. n.d. “The Abolition of Work.” The Anarchist Library.

I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that\u0026rsquo;s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.\nIn short, if you\u0026rsquo;re in search of generalizable knowledge that compounds exponentially over time, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.\nBut for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. Computers can be understood—even if it\u0026rsquo;s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nThe most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through pip install first.\u0026rdquo; (a) If you know how Git\u0026rsquo;s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.\nBlub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you\u0026rsquo;re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system\u0026rsquo;s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles [Learn things with a long shelf-life].\nOnce, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used user.name (the name field of an object stored in the user variable) instead of User.name (the name field of the class User) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; by which User.name was an instance of Column while user.name was a simple str. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python\u0026rsquo;s descriptor protocol (a) to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked\u0026mdash;and I realized that Python\u0026rsquo;s __dunder__ methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIf you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to look things up to figure out how they\u0026rsquo;re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM works under the hood. That\u0026rsquo;s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you\u0026rsquo;ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.\nBecause of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your \u0026ldquo;blub flywheel\u0026rdquo;—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I\u0026rsquo;m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to go deeper than necessary. If I really want to ship something, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out why that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I\u0026rsquo;ll bias against \u0026ldquo;guess-and-check\u0026rdquo; style debugging in favor of getting a better understanding of the system I\u0026rsquo;m trying to debug. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always feel worth it to, e.g., dive into the docs of tcpdump and iptables rules to track down my weird one-off networking issue—but over time I\u0026rsquo;ve run into enough \u0026ldquo;weird one-off networking issues\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s paid off many times over.\nThe second part of my blub flywheel is to pay attention to magic. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;m working with something new, I try to continuously update my best-guess mental model of how it\u0026rsquo;s implemented. \u0026ldquo;Okay, the docs are telling me to create an Ingress, I guess this is probably the widget that provisions a load balancer to talk to my backend containers?\u0026rdquo; If I realize I\u0026rsquo;m wrong, I\u0026rsquo;ll dig in and update. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I can\u0026rsquo;t ping those pods from outside the cluster, so how could the load balancer be talking to them? Aha—it\u0026rsquo;s talking to the nodes, and there\u0026rsquo;s a NodePort Service as a second layer of indirection.\u0026rdquo; If I have no idea at all how something could work, that usually means it\u0026rsquo;s time to read a book.\nBibliography References Kuhn, Ben. n.d. “In Defense of Blub Studies.” Benkuhn.Net.

Things that appear simple are often only simple on the surface and get \u0026ldquo;fiddly\u0026rdquo; if you go deeper. Salvatier proposes that this is a consistent property of the universe and isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to particular domains (i.e. programming, woodworking, physics, etc).\nThese details are difficult to identify since they are mostly-invisible before and after you notice them. Before you notice them you\u0026rsquo;re unaware of their existance, and afterward you\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated them into your Mental models so well as to make them disappear again! This makes it difficult to guide others past the snags you encountered.\nNotes [\u0026hellip;] it\u0026rsquo;s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you\u0026rsquo;re new [\u0026hellip;]\nConsider the boiling of water. That\u0026rsquo;s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?\nWell the stairs seemed simple too, so let\u0026rsquo;s double check.\nPut yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800\u0026rsquo;s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.\nGo to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.\n(I suggest actually doing this)\nThe first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water\u0026rsquo;s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem \u0026lsquo;unboiling\u0026rsquo;. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really look like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.\nTo make matters worse, if you\u0026rsquo;d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you\u0026rsquo;d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.\nWorse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement \u0026lsquo;water boils at 100 °C\u0026rsquo;.\nIt turns out that \u0026lsquo;boiling\u0026rsquo; is a lot more complicated than you thought.\nThis surprising amount of detail is is not limited to \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;complicated\u0026rdquo; domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to think \u0026lsquo;So what?\u0026rsquo; and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they are specific to stair carpentry; that\u0026rsquo;s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is not specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.\nYou can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself \u0026lsquo;man, it was so simple all along, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I had so much trouble\u0026rsquo;. [When people are naturally good at something] We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.\nThe more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.\nYou might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. [\u0026hellip;]\nYou might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren\u0026rsquo;t automatically visible, even when you\u0026rsquo;re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead.\nAnother way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing different details [Theory of mind]. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16\u0026rsquo; long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, \u0026rsquo;no, no, no, let\u0026rsquo;s just trace it\u0026rsquo;, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.\nI kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don\u0026rsquo;t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard \u0026rsquo;let\u0026rsquo;s draw some diagrams and compute the angle\u0026rsquo; and didn\u0026rsquo;t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don\u0026rsquo;t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.\nBefore you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to put your attention on them because you don\u0026rsquo;t even know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. But after you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you\u0026rsquo;re good at?\nThis means it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important [Metacognition, Scout mindset, Growth mindset].\nThis problem is not easy to fix, but it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible either. I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world [Draw the rest of the owl]. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems so wrong, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn\u0026rsquo;t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.\nIf you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:salvatierRealityHasSurprisingAmountDetail Backlinks Locator map (Staff Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Path) ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/16937276-fd62-4d50-90ef-cdf5ab036442/","summary":"(NO_ITEM_DATA:salvatierRealityHasSurprisingAmountDetail)\nSummary The title summarizes the thesis well: Reality has a surprising amount of detail.

Since one of those choices was the CompUSA around the block from us, my co-worker brought it there. And waited. And waited. And was told they were waiting for the part. We called the Apple store who said that they could do most repairs in 24 hours. The question was, \u0026ldquo;How do we get it back?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to a CompUSA on the east-coast, you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realize that they are PC-centric and the Macs are nearly non-existent. We only brought it there because it was so close and, gosh, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Apple have some way to certify that a CompUSA has qualified repair people and a good stash of spares before it would list that particular location? I mean, this is Apple, right? The best quality around? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that quality extend to their partners?\nSo my co-worker went to the CompUSA and asked if the repair was done. The guy went to the back room, then came out. \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case, I want it back.\u0026rdquo;\nThe repair person got very defensive. \u0026ldquo;Why do you want it back? It\u0026rsquo;s not working! What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\nMy co-worker, in a shining moment of brilliance realized that any kind of full disclosure would only result in an unproductive battle over the iMac that he could easily lose: possession is 9/10th of the law.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s taking too long\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d have to defend the assertion against a barrage of, \u0026ldquo;But we promise it will be only one more day\u0026rdquo; and other excuses.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m taking it to your competitor\u0026rdquo; then he\u0026rsquo;d have to suffer through someone defending his company\u0026rsquo;s honor (and profits) to defeat the request.\nBeing too honest wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help either. Saying \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re incompetent and I want to take it somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help the situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no cheese down that hole.\nThen he came up with the perfect answer: He shrugged his shoulders and said, \u0026ldquo;My boss wants it back.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the perfect answer. You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with it.\nIt can be said that the most effective communication is that that speaks in the audience\u0026rsquo;s terms. His answer said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a lacky just like you. Your boss is a jerk and gives you shit jobs to do, and I my boss is a jerk and gives me shit jobs. I\u0026rsquo;m just like you. Please, in the brotherhood of underpaid-lackeys-with-mean-bosses, just give it to me.\u0026rdquo;\nIt harkening back to mommy and daddy leaving you speechless as a child being told \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t have that candy because I said so\u0026rdquo; it disarms him. It turns the biggest repair shop bully into a crying, defenseless child.\nIt ends the argument because it says, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with me, I\u0026rsquo;m the messenger.\u0026rdquo;\nThe name for this technique is \u0026ldquo;playing dumb.\u0026rdquo; It is a technique that we geeks often forget. We geeks are smart. We get paid for being smart. We get paid for having all the answers. Someone once told me, \u0026ldquo;My value to the company is to be the guy that knows everything.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s us. We\u0026rsquo;re the smart people. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to not give a well-reasoned answer even when it won\u0026rsquo;t work.\n\u0026ldquo;My boss said so.\u0026rdquo; Short. Simple.

As it\u0026rsquo;s been said elsewhere, they \u0026ldquo;beg for the bad news.\u0026rdquo;\nMature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived Being able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multi-threaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes. Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and ego-boosting behavior send the message to other engineers (maybe tacitly) to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things. An engineer who is quick to call someone a moron is someone destined to stunt his or her career.\nThis also means that mature engineers have self-awareness when it comes to their communication. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer communicates perfectly, only that they have some notion about where they could be better, and continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how they\u0026rsquo;re doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it elsewhere, but I must emphasize the point more: the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.\nMature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it Avoiding responsibility for estimates is another way of saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure.\u0026rdquo; All businesses rely on estimates, and all engineers working on a project are involved in Joint Activity, which means that they have a responsibility to others to make themselves interpredictable. In general, mature engineers are comfortable with working within some nonzero amount of uncertainty and risk.\nMature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know they do This code looks good, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked other people to review it, and I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their feedback. Now: how long will it last before it\u0026rsquo;s rewritten? Once it\u0026rsquo;s in production, how will its execution affect resource usage? How much do I expect CPU/memory/disk/network to increase or decrease? Will others be able to understand this code? Am I making it as easy as I can for others to extend or introspect this work?\nMature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work Getting things done means doing things you might not be interested in. No matter how exciting or appealing a project is, there are always boring tasks. Tedious tasks. Tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title.\nMature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them They recognize that at some point, their individual contribution and potential cannot be exercised singularly. They recognize that there is only so much that can be produced by a single person, and the world\u0026rsquo;s best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers.\nMature engineers understand the difference between mentorship and sponsorship, and develop a habit of the latter Allspaw distinguishes between \u0026ldquo;mentorship\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sponsorship\u0026rdquo;:\nMentors face inward Sponsors face outward Engineers who find that the visibility of their own work is increasing acknowledge that a fundamental of wielding influence in your local community (both inside and outside your organization) is developing and maintaining awareness of opportunities to sponsor those around them that would benefit. It is not a secret that the tech industry is seriously challenged when it comes to supporting underrepresented and/or marginalized groups.\nDeveloping this as a habit takes effort, but the benefits are multi-fold; the engineer sharpens their critical-thinking skills (\u0026ldquo;oh, what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about in this meeting would be a great opportunity for $NAME to work on…\u0026rdquo;) and the sponsored engineer has opportunities that they otherwise might not.\n[\u0026hellip;] this instinct to mentor plays into the idea that those who are marginalized aren\u0026rsquo;t already skilled enough, smart enough, or ready for more responsibility or leadership.\nWhat members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice. They have to work extremely hard and be extremely good at what they do to combat the systemic privilege and unconscious bias at play in our work environments. They are consistently under-promoted and under-compensated for this work, even though it\u0026rsquo;s excellent work.\nMature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions They realize all engineering decisions, implementations, and designs exist within a spectrum; we do not live in a binary world. They can quickly point out contexts where one successful approach or solution could work and where it could not. They know that one cannot be both efficient and thorough at the same time (The ETTO Principle), that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.\nThey know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and are OK with that. They are comfortable with it because they strive to make the ideal and non-ideal in a design explicit. Later on in the lifecycle of a design, when the original design is not scaling anymore or needs to be replaced or rewritten, they can look back not with a perspective of how short-sighted those earlier decisions were, but instead say \u0026ldquo;yep, we made it this far with it and knew we\u0026rsquo;d have to extend or change it at some point. Looks like that time is now, let\u0026rsquo;s get to work!\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;]\nThe tl;dr on trade-offs is that everyone cuts corners, in every project. Immature engineers discover them in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them and recognize them as part of good engineering.\nMature engineers don\u0026rsquo;t practice CYAE (\u0026ldquo;Cover Your Ass Engineering\u0026rdquo;) An example of CYAE is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not my fault. They broke it, they used it wrong. I built it to spec, I can\u0026rsquo;t be held responsible for their mistakes or improper specification.\u0026rdquo;\nI disagree with this point. I consider a lot of the documentation and design work that a mature engineer does to be under the heading of CYA. I agree that mature engineers won\u0026rsquo;t seek to throw others under the bus. However, I also expect mature engineers to understand that others may not play by the same rules. I expect a mature engineer to, at least to some extent, play the game.\nMature engineers are empathetic In complex projects, there are usually a number of stakeholders. In any project, the designers, product managers, operations engineers, developers, and business development folks all have goals and perspectives, and mature engineers realize that those goals and views may be different. They understand this so that they can navigate effectively in the work that they do. Being empathetic in this sense means having the ability to view the project from another person\u0026rsquo;s perspective and to take that into consideration into your own work.\nMature engineers make grounded complaints [\u0026hellip;] they express judgments based on empirical evidence and bring with those judgments options for solving the problem which they\u0026rsquo;ve identified. A great manager of mine said to never go to your boss with a complaint about anything without at least one (ideally more than one) suggestion for a solution. Even demonstrating that you\u0026rsquo;ve tried working the problem on your own and came up empty-handed is better than an empty complaint.\nMature engineers are aware of cognitive biases This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer needs to have a degree in psychology, but cognitive biases are what can limit the growth of an engineer\u0026rsquo;s career at a certain point. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re not aware of the details of how they appear or how these biases can be guarded against, most mature engineers I know have a level of self-awareness to at least recognize they (like everyone) are susceptible to them.\nThe Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming Appropriate, even if old\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it referenced as coming from The Psychology of Computer Programming (a), written in 1971, but I don\u0026rsquo;t actually see it in the text. Regardless, here are The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming, found on @wyattdanger (a)\u0026rsquo;s blog post (a) on receiving advice from his dad:\nUnderstand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them early before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry. We can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on. You are not your code. Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found. Don\u0026rsquo;t take it personally when one is uncovered. (Allspaw note \u0026ndash; related: see below, number #10, and the points Theo made above.) No matter how much \u0026ldquo;karate\u0026rdquo; you know, someone else will always know more. Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it\u0026rsquo;s not needed. Don\u0026rsquo;t rewrite code without consultation. There\u0026rsquo;s a fine line between \u0026ldquo;fixing code\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rewriting code.\u0026rdquo; Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience. Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don\u0026rsquo;t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position. Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect \u0026ndash; so if you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat. Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don\u0026rsquo;t take revenge or say \u0026ldquo;I told you so.\u0026rdquo; Never make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry. Don\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026ldquo;the coder in the corner.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t be the person in the dark office emerging only for soda. The coder in the corner is out of sight, out of touch, and out of control. This person has no voice in an open, collaborative environment. Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community. Critique code instead of people \u0026ndash; be kind to the coder, not to the code. As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc. Bibliography References Allspaw, John. n.d. “On Being A Senior Engineer.” Kitchen Soap.

Technologist are: Startups use new technology because of their immaturity rather than despite it. Playing with new \u0026ldquo;The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure.\u0026rdquo; Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I\u0026rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people\u0026rsquo;s software.\nThe second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.\nThis was surprising because it seems so clearly against our own interest. In almost every case, companies fail because they build the wrong thing. Unless your customers are themselves engineers, I\u0026rsquo;m the wrong person to help with that. You want someone comfortable at the periphery of your system, who wants to learn about the competitive landscape, who wants to talk to customers. You want a product engineer.\nBut consider our standard interview questions: data structures, recursion, and computational complexity. It always feels a little strange when I see someone arguing that these don\u0026rsquo;t reflect \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; day-to-day software tasks; I write recursive functions all the time. But that\u0026rsquo;s a consequence of the abstraction; what might be a simple nested lookup on any specific datatype becomes recursion when you try to generalize over a set of possible datatypes.\nLikewise, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it argued that the difference between, say, O(log N) and O(N) isn\u0026rsquo;t important, because in practice N tends to be small enough. That may be true for some domains, maybe even most of them, but if you\u0026rsquo;re building a general-purpose tool you have to focus on the pathological cases.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut if we want to hire product engineers, what questions should we ask instead? It\u0026rsquo;s impractical, given the sprawling scope of our industry, to only consider candidates with prior experience in our exact product space. Likewise, it\u0026rsquo;s unrealistic to expect that we\u0026rsquo;d have expertise in a candidate\u0026rsquo;s prior product spaces. We lack a common vocabulary, a common understanding of the nuances that separate good design choices from middling ones.\nAnd so we continue to search for our keys under the streetlamp; they could be anywhere, but this is where the light is. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, the technologists we hire will also have all the other skills necessary to make humane, useful software.\nThis means that even if you\u0026rsquo;re not a technologist, you have to learn how to pretend. [Be what they expect you to be]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs many have pointed out, this is not a rational strategy for building a company. It is, however, a phenomenal way to train new technologists. Chesterton notwithstanding, the fastest way to learn why a fence exists is to tear it down and see what happens.\nSeen from this perspective, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem so irrational; most startups fail before reaching a scale that has any existential technical risks. The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure. If the startup fails, there\u0026rsquo;s no harm done. If the startup gets traction, the engineers can apply their newfound wisdom.\nThis means startups don\u0026rsquo;t adopt new technologies despite their immaturity, they adopt them because of that immaturity. This drives a constant churn of novelty and obsolescence, which amplifies the importance of a technologist\u0026rsquo;s skillset, which drives startups to adopt new technologies.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBy introducing abstraction into every problem we solve, we distance ourselves from how our work is ultimately used. We tell ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re in the business of building sharp knives; if we made them safer, they\u0026rsquo;d be useless for everything except spreading butter. We float above the the effects of what we\u0026rsquo;ve created, treating them as inexorable consequences of progress.\nBibliography References Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Trapped in the Technologist Factory.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/trapped-in-the-technologist-factory.html#fn:hbase.

They are not, for instance, just someone with ten years of experience. They are not just someone who maintains a popular open source project.

These laundry lists are detailed, nuanced (a), and typically leave the reader feeling as if they have a long way to go.\nEmpirically, though, there are many people who have the title \u0026ldquo;senior engineer\u0026rdquo; who do not possess all these skills. Unless all of them can be explained by title inflation or poor management, this is a serious disconnect with reality. We have to treat these articles as aspirational: a description of the industry as it should be. For someone wanting to make a significant, recognized impact on their company, today, these articles are more distracting than helpful.\nSenior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company\u0026rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhere possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance. However, this is only possible if the problem space is well understood. Premature abstraction, in code or elsewhere, introduces risk. If the failure modes in production are poorly understood, volunteering for pager duty may be the only way to really help.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMost risks, especially where managed effectively, never come to pass. For this reason, it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to tell the difference between real risk and perceived risk. By the same token, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real impact and perceived impact. If a senior engineer identifies a significant risk, they have to be able to concisely explain and prioritize it for a non-expert audience.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nEvery company has different risks, and so every company expects something different from their senior engineers. An engineer who has spent the last five years making small, continuous improvements to the processes in a larger company may not enjoy or even understand the sort of role expected by a three person startup. The expectation that \u0026ldquo;senior\u0026rdquo; is a fungible title is both widespread and harmful, leading to unrealistic expectations from both engineers and companies.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:tellmanSeniorEngineersReduceRisk Backlinks Blogroll Sabrina Leandro | So You\u0026rsquo;re Staff+ \u0026hellip; Now What?

My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore. His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.\nI recognized that he had a tendency towards self-aggrandizement (a) and awkward flattery of his readers (a), but at worst he seemed harmless. As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.\nRecently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore. He\u0026rsquo;s written (a) about the need to defend \u0026ldquo;moderates\u0026rdquo; from bullies on the \u0026ldquo;extreme left\u0026rdquo;, asserted (a) that \u0026ldquo;the truth is to the right of the median\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;the left is culturally dominant,\u0026rdquo; and justified (a) Coinbase\u0026rsquo;s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed \u0026ldquo;political\u0026rdquo; by saying that it \u0026ldquo;will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.\u0026rdquo;\nI went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something. It turned out that I had. There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design. In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut Graham\u0026rsquo;s analysis of brevity, and indeed of all language design, was fundamentally unserious. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in a rigorous definition of brevity, because the ultimate measure of a language\u0026rsquo;s quality was still his hacker\u0026rsquo;s radar. All of his essays, and Arc itself, were just spokes around that central hub. If his essays sometimes disagreed, or if Arc didn\u0026rsquo;t reflect his essays, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly surprising; their only connection was they all, in the moment, seemed right and true to Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMichael Polanyi coined the term \u0026ldquo;Tacit knowledge\u0026rdquo; to describe something we only understand as part of something else. When we speak, for instance, we don\u0026rsquo;t focus on the sounds we\u0026rsquo;re making, we focus on our words. We understand how to speak, but would struggle to explain it. Tacit knowledge comprises the vast majority of what we know; we rely on it constantly.\nWhen that knowledge begins to lead us astray, however, Polanyi tells us we that must delve into it. We must make it explicit [Make implicit knowledge explicit]. An explicit understanding of speech might be necessary for someone with a speech impediment, but also for a professional performer; to be at the top of your field, it\u0026rsquo;s almost always necessary to transform innate talent into something more.\nA rare exception to this rule is the chicken sexer, who can quickly and accurately determine whether a day-old chick is male or female. The two are indistinguishable to most, but an expert can classify a thousand chicks an hour with 98% accuracy. The knowledge underpinning this expertise has never been made explicit; a trainee is simply corrected by an expert, over and over, until their intuition is equally refined.\nHeld to this standard, however, we all fall short. No one\u0026rsquo;s sensibilities about software design are so refined that they can teach simply through demonstration. We have to distill our intuition down to principles, and let those principles guide us beyond the bounds of our intuition. Anything less is just rentier pedagogy; maxims stripped of any context, whose true meaning within a given situation can only be judged by a single person.\nThis is the essence of modern \u0026ldquo;thought leadership\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s served Graham well. His essays on language design, as well as a few on startups, brought in the first entrepreneurs to his fledgling VC fund. People applied to YCombinator because they wanted Graham to apply his intuition to their problems.\nGraham\u0026rsquo;s essays on startups were much the same as his essays on language design, but they served a different purpose. They were marketing content, and in that role they excelled. They tantalized the reader by reducing complex problems down to singular, nebulous concepts. They hinted at deep insights that were just out of reach. They made people want to be in the same room as Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA recurring theme in his essays, both before (a) and after (a) his time at YCombinator, is conformity. Graham is resolutely on the side of the non-conformist, repeatedly tracing their lineage back to Galileo\u0026rsquo;s insistence that the earth moves (a), even after the church had forced him to recant.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGraham writes \u0026ldquo;the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \u0026lsquo;Eppur si muove,\u0026rdquo; but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t pause to consider that it is also \u0026ldquo;EARTH HAS 4 CORNER SIMULTANEOUS 4-DAY TIME CUBE\u0026rdquo; (a) and, more worryingly, \u0026ldquo;Jews will not replace us\u0026rdquo; (a). His model exists largely so he can focus on the one quadrant he finds interesting, but even that is a proxy for a much smaller group, the moral and intellectual heirs of Galileo, the people he intuits to be his peers. Graham doesn\u0026rsquo;t work through the consequences of his own model because the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; what matters is sharing some things that feel right and true.\nThis is all to say that Paul Graham is an effective marketer and practitioner, but a profoundly unserious public intellectual. His attempts to grapple with the major issues of the present, especially as they intersect with his personal legacy, are so mired in intuition and incuriosity that they\u0026rsquo;re at best a distraction, and worst a real obstacle to understanding our paths forward.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:tellmanThoughtLeadersChickenSexers Backlinks Blogroll ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/89af4069-9f38-4f2b-bdb4-491c2ae85a9c/","summary":"Zach Tellman, (NO_ITEM_DATA:tellmanThoughtLeadersChickenSexers)\nSummary Thought leaders : Explicit knowledge \\:: Chicken sexers : Implicit knowledge Paul Graham is an unserious public intellectual who relies on Implicit knowledge and fails to fully grapple with the models he presents as Truth; a chicken sexer Notes From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.

Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.\u0026rdquo; [Do things that compound] Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime.

The goal for this writing session is only to get them down and out of my head. They are listed in no particular order.\nOnly work on things that matter. Things that matter can be defended and argued to others; ideally with hard numbers. Be cautious about investing into projects that cannot be argued with numbers. Taking a closer look at the numbers around search keyboard usage may have led me to invest less in a technically complex keyboard solution (Kabu). Verify assumptions/expectations as early as possible. Get an experiment out there to confirm the things you think will happen as soon as possible. What is the minimum viable product? Build that and send it out. Confirm, with numbers, that the thing you want to build is worth building. Write your assumptions down throughout the duration of the project, especially at the beginning, and track them. How and when will you test them? Under promise and over deliver. Pad estimates. Be cautious when agreeing to deadlines. The unexpected always happens. Break projects down. Then break them down more. Trim all of the fat and get to MVP as soon as you can. From there, ensure steady and meaningful deliverables. Coding should be more typing than thinking. Design a solution away from the computer, then return and type it up. Document everything. Specifically, document what you do and the status of your projects. You\u0026rsquo;ll forget more than you ever know so write it down. I have come to like this process: write down the important things you do on a daily basis, summarize those at the end of the week, summarize those every month. Then, in addition to those notes, keep a set of notes specific to each project you\u0026rsquo;re working on. These project notes should include an up-to-date-at-all-times timeline of events and should include references to everything related to the project. This is more than you would ever send to someone but that\u0026rsquo;s not what it is for. This document is the bible for the project. It\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll pull from whenever you\u0026rsquo;re asked any question about the project from now until the end of time. Put time on your calendar to keep these documents up to date. Communicate regularly with stakeholders. Keep in mind that your audience dictates the way you present information. I\u0026rsquo;ve found through trial and error that a bi-weekly update is sufficient for most projects. More often than that and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to make meaningful progress enough to make the update worthwhile to write. That said, it may be useful to send something brief to your immediate team every week, or update them in a meeting. Communicate delays or other changes to the plan as early as possible. Taken from my Keep notepad:\nReach out to other teams before your invest time and effort to be sure they haven\u0026rsquo;t already fixed the problem Find a single point of contact (tl, etc) on collaborating teams. Send them docs for easily review. Proactively communicate. It\u0026rsquo;s your job to surface things and ask questions, it\u0026rsquo;s not their job to think of your questions for you. Or, rather, you can\u0026rsquo;t assume they will do you should act like they won\u0026rsquo;t. Don\u0026rsquo;t enter into a project without a good understanding of the benefits in a numeric sense. Kabu is, potentially, a massive 5 quarter long project which will introduce additional download times for our users and provide little in tangible benefits. Communicate especially when you feel too stressed to communicate. Take notes and document especially when you feel like there\u0026rsquo;s no time to. Adhere to all the good engineering habits especially when you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ll get them first thing on Monday when you get back. When feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to go for a quick walk and when you\u0026rsquo;re done with the walk write down the things that need to be done. Now that it certain down, does it feel as overwhelming? Is there any way to shorten the list by making concessions or cutting features? Can you reach out to anybody on the team to help you prioritize the list? Taken from another Keep note:\nHow much mayonnaise is in the jar? Meaning, to borrow another saying, how large is the market. The same hour of effort has different results based on the project it\u0026rsquo;s applied to. Understand what the payout stands to be for anything you\u0026rsquo;re working on. Think about your project from the perspective of an l7 who couldn\u0026rsquo;t give less of a shit. Can you convince them, with something concrete, to give a shit about the project? Rapid iteration beats coding in a tower for 6 months. Get to experiment quickly with a hack to prove that the real version is worth the effort. Think metrics first. Write up a step by step guide to evaluating projects and working on them. Include this shit so I won\u0026rsquo;t forget it again. Taken from a Keep note:\nThoroughly reviewing existing code when coming into extend an existing project. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s bug free. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s written well. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume the engineers who wrote it adhered to best practices or designed it in an extensible way. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume there are tests of any kind (unit, integration, end-to-end). Prioritize Deep work\nI realized when writing this that the whole lot of it is the same as what\u0026rsquo;s posted all over the internet. The only difference is that these words mean more to me because I bled to learn them. It makes me wonder how much value there really is in seeking out advice online.\n2019-08-20\nOnly work on things that have buy in from L+1, ideally L+2 or L+3. Things that higher ups are going to be judged against are going to be the things that they are motivated to invest in. Ideally, they\u0026rsquo;re success should depend on your success. This will ensure they make sure you succeed without you needing to do extra maneuvering. I cannot work in a silo for too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely weary of letting it run too long.

I thought about this in the context of citations needed episode 166. They discuss education specifically. It\u0026rsquo;s propagandisement as a great equalizer. Pursuing an education is a fantastic individual strategy to increase earning potential. However, systemically, one cannot say that everything can be solved by giving people more education. That is definitely part of a solution. More education is a great thing after all. However, the episode focuses on the rhetoric around providing education as a panacea against poverty, where it is one of many things that need to be done to alleviate poverty. It is the twisting of something that\u0026rsquo;s a great idea for an individual, however, is not wholly representative of a good systemic strategy.

Spqr Both sides have merit aka teach both sides A phrase I see brought to bear more and more, and overwhelmingly regarding culture war topics. The big one, in my mind at least, used to be creationism and the Big Bang – that schools should teach both as equally powerful and correct. Often wrong; only one side has merit. Though not a phase at the time I first heard the phrase, the underlying rationale maps cleanly onto \u0026ldquo;alternative facts\u0026rdquo;. Cultural matters aren\u0026rsquo;t math insofar as there isn\u0026rsquo;t an objective right answer. We live in a cold universe after all. However, we can make our part of the universe warm (related, moloch and gardens). We can decide that slavery (yes I\u0026rsquo;m going for the emotionally resonant examples because I find that\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re used with most often) is abhorrent. Related to \u0026ldquo;This is a matter for the states\u0026rdquo; only when a nation-wide federal/judicial-level policy isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Related to \u0026ldquo;The science/jury is still out\u0026rdquo;; we\u0026rsquo;re right, so if the evidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t bear that out then we clearly aren\u0026rsquo;t fine collecting evidence and arguing – especially arguing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair (a) Carpe futura Level order search The word bear derives from a term that we think was used in the style of Voldemort to talk about a thing without using its true name; honey eaters Odd finding have rotational symmetry Even functions have mirror symmetry Avg(v) = 1/n * 1 t v Python list indexing cloze for names [start🔚step] P(A U B) equivalence Centering matrix equivalence Suspend Name to Letter NATO phonetic alphabet What is the determinant?

Partly because the employee could go elsewhere for that kind of thing because it is now in Vogue. However, it is in Vogue because a happy employee who identifies with the company who is spiritually fulfilled produce more than employees who lack these things. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t a small magnifying effect. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge magnifying effect. The employees, the knowledge workers, are the asset of the company. Maintaining their mental and spiritual health is the new form of mechanization or offshoring.

It overlaps well with my own Style Guide.\nNotes Introduction Why write nonfiction?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGain leverage\nKeeping thoughts to yourself can be a disservice to the world. If you have something important to say and you say it well, you send strangers down paths badly needed.\nWriting is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch.\nClarity of thought\nWriting is a laxative for the mind. When you write, your brain can\u0026rsquo;t stop itself from drawing connections between ideas—and exploring their implications. This shines a light on broken logic, which helps you gain clarity of thought.\nWriting is the act of thinking clearly with the help of paper. Writing slows down your thinking so you can play with your ideas.\nHuman connection\nThe most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet.\nIf you do interesting things then write about them publicly with an authentic voice, like-minded people want to meet the person behind that voice. Writing is a bat signal for your people.\n(Shapiro n.d.), formatting mine\nWhat to Write About Choose your topic A novel idea is one that\u0026rsquo;s not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and worthwhile. I\u0026rsquo;ve identified five categories:\nCounter-intuitive — \u0026ldquo;Oh, I never realized the world worked that way.\u0026rdquo; Counter-narrative — \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s not how I was told the world worked!\u0026rdquo; Shock and awe — \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s crazy. I would have never believed it.\u0026rdquo; Elegant articulations — \u0026ldquo;Beautiful. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have said it better myself.\u0026rdquo; Make someone feel seen — \u0026ldquo;Yes! That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I feel!\u0026rdquo; (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nYour objective clarifies what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish, and your motivation ensures you actually see it through.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all that\u0026rsquo;s needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles.\nIf the right objective and motivation combo isn\u0026rsquo;t coming right away, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what\u0026rsquo;s in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nWrite an intro I define an intro as the minimal information necessary to:\nIntroduce the breadth of the post\u0026rsquo;s contents so that readers can decide if it\u0026rsquo;s for them. Hook readers into reading more. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you hook readers, so long as you eventually fulfill the hook.\nA hook is not a gimmick. It\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental psychological principle: A great intro—like an electrifying opening to a film—buys goodwill with readers. Buy enough goodwill and readers look past the weaker parts of your post—because they\u0026rsquo;re chasing the high from your great opening.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA hook is a half-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer:\nQuestions — Pose an intriguing question, but don\u0026rsquo;t give the full answer. Narratives — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion. Research — Highlight research findings, but only a small portion. Arguments — Make an unexpected claim, but don\u0026rsquo;t explain how it\u0026rsquo;s true. Hooks serve two purposes:\nThey compel readers to continue reading. They switch on the storytelling machinery in readers\u0026rsquo; heads. They help you identify what\u0026rsquo;s interesting—novel—to write about. In a nonfiction essay that explores new ideas, an effective intro often follows this structure:\nEstablish shared context. Surface a problem and what\u0026rsquo;s at stake. Explore the problem\u0026rsquo;s significance. Tease a clever solution. (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nCombat skepticism In your intro, consider proactively countering any major skepticisms that exist. There are five types of skepticism to counter:\nSuperficial: Superficial skepticism emerges from readers not believing you\u0026rsquo;ll share things they don\u0026rsquo;t already know.\nSolution: Tease your original insights in your introduction.‍\nIrrelevant: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll cover key points they care about.\nSolution: List the points you\u0026rsquo;ll cover.‍\nSloppy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want to sit through bad writing.\nSolution: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.‍\nImplausible: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll deliver on your hooks.\nSolution: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.\nUntrustworthy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re qualified to write about this.\nSolution: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can\u0026rsquo;t help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they believe you. Or, if you\u0026rsquo;re indeed unqualified, be upfront about it and frame the post as an exploratory journey you\u0026rsquo;re taking them on.\nIf you successfully hook readers while neutralizing their skepticism, you generate goodwill: now they\u0026rsquo;re invested in reading the rest of your post.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nIntegrate feedback See also Collaborate for better results.\nMy favorite writing trick is to only write my introduction then ask friends who represent my audience this question:\n\u0026ldquo;After reading only this intro, what are the most interesting ideas I could possibly cover in the rest of the post?\u0026rdquo;\nI pick and choose the responses that resonate with me. This is how I de-risk my post from lacking novelty: Am I headed in a direction that\u0026rsquo;s maximally interesting?\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nThe elements of a great intro\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a compelling hook into your topic. Readers sense forthcoming novelty. It conveys the importance of the idea so that readers want to hear the rest of the story. It twisted the knife enough to help readers feel the pain you\u0026rsquo;re speaking to. It\u0026rsquo;s concise. Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want all the details; they want the minimum needed to be teased by your novelty in a way that resonates. (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowSourceWritingIdeas)\nWriting First Drafts You\u0026rsquo;re a proxy for your die-hard readers.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the irony of self-indulgent writing: writing for yourself is the quickest path to writing something others love.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowWriteFirstDraft)\nThe mistake writers make is believing expertise is required to write compelling nonfiction. Nope, it\u0026rsquo;s the rabid desire to indulge your curiosity.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowWriteFirstDraft)\nWhen ideas stop flowing, ask yourself:\nHow can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said? (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowWriteFirstDraft)\nI\u0026rsquo;m not convinced conclusions are necessary. But I like placing them after my resulting points to prompt readers into action. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nFirst, share a poignant takeaway Identify your article\u0026rsquo;s significance by re-reading it and asking, \u0026ldquo;What was this really about? What was I trying to say?\u0026rdquo;\nDistill the answer into a single, punchy sentence. Make readers think, \u0026ldquo;Ahh, yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why this article was profound.\u0026rdquo;\nNext, provide next steps Now that your wisdom has resonated with readers, ask yourself, What about the world can my readers better appreciate now that they\u0026rsquo;ve read my article?\nShare where they can go next to continue the journey they started here.\nFor a writing guide such as this, I might conclude by sharing bloggers whose work I enjoy. Then I might urge you to reverse engineer their articles and study what makes them great. That\u0026rsquo;s how you continue your learning.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowWriteFirstDraft)\nWhile writing, keep these points in mind:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained by your outline. Expect to discover most of your ideas throughout the writing process. Trust that what interests you is what interests your readers. If not, target an audience more like yourself. (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowWriteFirstDraft)\nRewriting and Editing Your favorite authors\u0026rsquo; first drafts are typically bad too. However, great authors have the discipline to aggressively rewrite their first drafts in pursuit of:\nBeing clearly understood Persuasive reasoning Sustaining curiosity Resonance — Story, analogy, and poetry The enemy of those objectives is being precious about what you originally said and how you originally said it.\nWhen you first write an idea down, you do so in whatever disjointed way immediately came to mind. Rewriting is the art of finding the correct puzzle pieces within that mess and putting them together in the right order.\nIn short, your first draft is to extract novel ideas out of your brain. Your second draft is to rewrite those ideas so they resonate.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nGoal: Be understood I like to write sentences that a thirteen-year-old could follow.\nIf they can understand, so can everyone else—including anyone who\u0026rsquo;s skimming.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say children should understand the details and nuances. Rather, I think children should be able to follow the logic of all your arguments.\nYou already do this intuitively. When speaking to children, you simplify:\nYou use plain phrasing. You use fewer ideas per sentence. (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nThis reminds me of Freddish, though it\u0026rsquo;s aimed at a much younger audience.\nRemove abstract phrasing\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sentence with complex phrasing:\n\u0026ldquo;The obstacle facing media organizations is charting an economically sustainable course through a landscape of commodity journalism.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that plainly:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are struggling to stay in business because anyone with a Twitter account can report the news now. The news has never been more of a commodity than it is today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how you talk to a thirteen-year-old. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how you should talk to everyone all the time.\nIn the revised example, I removed abstract words like \u0026ldquo;charted\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;landscape,\u0026rdquo; and I represented a concept with a specific example.\nBy removing this overhead, the underlying point stands out. That\u0026rsquo;s our goal.\nGrammatical simplification such as this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make your writing worse. The complexity of your writing should emerge from the strength of its ideas, not from how those ideas are worded.\nHowever, don\u0026rsquo;t drop key information when simplifying. This, for example, would be too reductive:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are not doing well today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat loses the point of why news companies are not doing well. Simplify your sentences without removing the nuances.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to over-index on the \u0026ldquo;make it concrete\u0026rdquo; aspect of this advice. I worry someone reading the second sentence may walk away with the mistaken understanding that Twitter is the sole driving force behind commodity journalism.\nSimilarly, a double-edged sword of abstract writing is that it can have multiple correct interpretations. Consider the following rewrite:\nOne last example. Let\u0026rsquo;s remove abstract words and talk plainly:\nBad paragraph — \u0026ldquo;Ignorance of corporate dynamics represent a persistent source of pain for a certain type of operator. Intelligent but inexperienced. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that you avoid this pain by understanding how other people make decisions in the context that they\u0026rsquo;re incentivized to do so and by appreciating the constraints they\u0026rsquo;re operating within.\u0026rdquo;\nRewritten — \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s common to be a smart person who\u0026rsquo;s unaware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I recommend writing down the frameworks your team uses to make big decisions. Then, when a colleague proposes an idea that doesn\u0026rsquo;t intuitively make sense to you, think through their idea using their own frameworks. Work from there to build empathy and have a constructive dialogue.\u0026rdquo;\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nI read the \u0026ldquo;Bad paragraph\u0026rdquo; to be discussing how inter-personal and corporate politics influence an organization. The \u0026ldquo;Intelligent but inexperienced\u0026rdquo; operator would be one who knows how to do their tasks well but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know The game. As an example: They may, without intending to, make another coworker look foolish and thereby make an enemy.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Rewritten\u0026rdquo; paragraph seems to discuss how to navigate a bureaucracy with an obscured decision-making process and advocates empathy.\nA statement made in plain language would avoid this ambiguity.\nUse fewer ideas per sentence\nAgain, I take issue with the example presented:\nConsider this bad paragraph:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a fast growing collection of data describing the structure and functional capacity of human gut bacteria in a variety of conditions. Ongoing efforts to further characterize the multitude of functions of gut bacteria and the mechanisms underlying its interactions will provide a better understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health and disease.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that for a thirteen-year-old:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research on gut bacteria. We\u0026rsquo;re quickly learning which roles gut bacteria play and how they interact with each other. Researchers want to better understand how these bacteria can affect our overall health.\u0026rdquo;\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research\u0026rdquo; may read to some as \u0026ldquo;There is enough/sufficient research\u0026rdquo;.\nProvide examples\nTips for providing examples:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just provide good examples, also provide bad examples. Before-and-after comparisons—like a good paragraph versus a bad paragraph—clarify what you mean and don\u0026rsquo;t mean. Help readers orient themselves on a spectrum of right to wrong. If you make your examples fun and topical, readers pay more attention. Examples with many moving parts should possibly be turned into diagrams.

What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from asking a lot of friends for feedback is that readers often quit not because they dislike your ideas, but because they\u0026rsquo;re bored.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn speech, when you say something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you can add sentences to further explain your point. Don\u0026rsquo;t do that in writing. If your sentence doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you go back and rewrite it.\nWriting is a process of deliberate thought curation—where each sentence can justify its inclusion in your final draft.\nWhen a deliberate writer has written something down, they then ask:\nWhat is the purpose of the statement I just made? What effect does it have on the reader\u0026rsquo;s mind? Is there something more useful I could have said instead? Later, when they get stuck expanding on their ideas, they ask:\nHow can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said? (NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nFeedback Getting feedback is the most efficient way to improve your writing. This is not optional. Giving feedback is as important: giving it to others forces you to internalize the learnings from this handbook.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nAsk for feedback from the audience you\u0026rsquo;re writing for. Here\u0026rsquo;s a template:\nIt would be helpful if you read my article slowly to transcribe the reactions you have while reading it. For example:\nTell me what to delete — When you notice your interest is fading, you can say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m drifting here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t compelling and it isn\u0026rsquo;t adding value. Get to the point quicker and hook me.\u0026rdquo;\nTell me what to double down on — When something excites you, you can say \u0026ldquo;Dopamine hit. Go further in this direction. I have more questions.\u0026rdquo;\nTell me what isn\u0026rsquo;t clear — When you\u0026rsquo;re done reading, please score this from 1-10 on how satisfying it was. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to give me a low score. By telling me this needs work, you\u0026rsquo;re sparing me from releasing bad work to the public.\nKeep asking for feedback then rewriting until you average a score of 7.5+ across a handful of respondents. That puts you in the \u0026ldquo;this was a good read\u0026rdquo; category.\nDo not waste time striving for 9+. One reader\u0026rsquo;s 9 is not the same as another\u0026rsquo;s, so trying to satisfy everyone results in a bloated post that satisfies no one. There are many great ways to tell a story, so be happy when you\u0026rsquo;ve found one that works.\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:shapiroWritingHandbookHowRewriteYourFirstDraft)\nI worry that the 1-10 scale is too wide \u0026ndash; that one individual\u0026rsquo;s 7/10 isn\u0026rsquo;t meaningfully different from their 6/10. Perhaps a 1-5 scale?\nYour best source of feedback is often you with the benefit of hindsight. But you need a break to get that perspective.

Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll mention your:\nTone of voice Sense of humor Eccentricities Viewpoints Convey those traits in your writing, and readers [will] recognize your voice. Meaning, I don\u0026rsquo;t think voice is your choice of words. It\u0026rsquo;s your unfiltered self reflected on paper.\nIn early drafts, I like to discard my reflex to self-censor. Talk vulnerably like you do with friends. In later drafts, you can remove sensitive details.\nUntil then, it\u0026rsquo;s a confession.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe antidote to inauthenticity is reminding yourself how you talk with friends.

This is the game about the game. It is often called \u0026rsquo;the meta'.\nEvery sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.\nWhat is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.\nThe nature of the metagame demands that you play the base game well. It lives on top of the pattern-matching that comes with expertise.\nThis seems like an obvious thing to say. But as with most such things, the second-order implications are more interesting than the first-order ones. For instance, because expertise is necessary to play the metagame, it is often useful to search for the meta in your domain as a north star for expertise. The way I remind myself of this is to say that I should \u0026rsquo;locate the meta\u0026rsquo; whenever I\u0026rsquo;m at the bottom of a skill tree. Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t yet participate, searching for the metagame that experts play will usually give me hints as to what skills I must acquire in order to become good enough.\nAn example suffices: in marketing, I have found it very useful to seek out articles or podcasts (but especially podcasts) where practitioners talk about the ways their best practices have changed: \u0026ldquo;In the past I did X and now it seems it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well, so now we do Y, and I recommend Y.\u0026rdquo; This tells me that:\nI need to learn Y and at least have a passing familiarity with X, because X is what came before and is \u0026lsquo;covered ground\u0026rsquo;, and I need to remember the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of the shift. If one such shift happened in the past, more may happen in the future. More concretely, this is something like a podcast guest saying:\n\u0026ldquo;In the past (for content marketing) I did roundup posts, but these don\u0026rsquo;t seem to work as well anymore. So now we do longer, more comprehensive guides, and we cross-launch those to Product Hunt and Hacker News and social media. That seems to work better for us.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich in turn tells me:\nI need to look up as many examples of these \u0026lsquo;comprehensive guides\u0026rsquo; to see what the state of the art looks like. From there I can develop an understanding of how they are planned, how they are executed and what success looks like when these things are launched. And I must launch one to verify their effectiveness for myself.\nI need to try my hand at at least one roundup post, just for the tacit experience of doing it.\nAnd I must ask: why did roundup posts fail? Well, because too many people are doing it. (Is this true? How do I verify?) Why might the current best practice fail, then? I might not know the answer to this because I am a noob, but a side-effect of (1) is that I now know the best practitioners of the guide strategy, and I can observe them to see what changes in their marketing over the next few years.\nNote what I\u0026rsquo;m not saying, however. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that I should actively pursue the meta — this is ineffective, because I am not good enough to play. I cannot execute even if I know where the puck is going. But studying the state of the metagame as it is right now often tells me what I must learn in order to get to that point.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t master a particular skill, drop back down to its component elements and practice each of them in isolation. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get good conversions in your content marketing, drop down to practice publishing at a regular cadence.

Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an \u0026ldquo;I know more than you do\u0026rdquo;- or \u0026ldquo;Just because\u0026rdquo;-type responses.\nThoughts The learning done through Socratic questioning is worth the potential friction of such a conversation. Be careful that the person is asking questions in good faith rather than attempting to Control the conversation.\nNotes Imagine an kid in school first hearing about germ theory. The conversation might go something like this:\nTeacher: Many diseases like the common cold are spread by germs, when one infected person contacts another.\nStudent: But I got a cold a few weeks ago, and I never touch anyone except my family members. And none of them were sick.\nTeacher: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to actually touch someone. Sometimes it can spread through mucus droplets in the air.\nStudent: And one time I was camping in the woods for a month, and then I got a cold, even though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been around anybody.\nTeacher: If it was spring, you might have gotten allergies. Allergies can feel a lot like a cold, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t spread by germs.\nStudent: It was fall.\nTeacher: Then maybe it was an unusual allergy, or some other condition.\nStudent: Hey, wait. If germs are spread from person to person on touch, why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the government just mandate one week when nobody is allowed to touch anyone else? Then all the germs will die and we\u0026rsquo;ll never have to worry about germs again.\nTeacher: That\u0026rsquo;s a good question. A lot of germs have what\u0026rsquo;s called reservoirs in the environment, where they live when they\u0026rsquo;re not infecting humans. Even if the government tried your plan, probably most sicknesses would come back from their reservoirs.\nStudent: I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a germ reservoir. Where are they?\nTeacher: They\u0026rsquo;re not literal reservoirs like a water reservoir, that\u0026rsquo;s just what we call it when germs live in bats or raccoons or something.\nNotice a few things about this conversation.\nFirst, it\u0026rsquo;s really good that it happened. The student was clearly confused at many points. First, he had direct evidence that seemed to contradict the teacher\u0026rsquo;s claims that germs only spread by touch. Second, he had a sort of efficient-market-style confusion: germ theory seems to imply an easy way to eliminate all sicknesses forever, so why hasn\u0026rsquo;t someone picked this low-hanging fruit? Third, he was confused by an awkward term – he thought germ reservoirs were lakes full of germs in the hills somewhere.\nAll of these confusions are totally understandable. In fact, they\u0026rsquo;re a really good sign he\u0026rsquo;s paying attention – that he\u0026rsquo;s trying to figure out what germ theory really means and how it interacts with the rest of his worldview. They\u0026rsquo;re the direct opposite of guessing the teacher\u0026rsquo;s password. One day this kid is going to be an amazing scientist.\nSecond, to a hostile observer, it would sound like the student was challenging the teacher. Every time the teacher tried to explain germ theory, the student \u0026ldquo;pounced\u0026rdquo; on a supposed inconsistency. When the teacher tried to explain the inconsistency, the student challenged her explanations. At times he almost seems to be mocking the teacher. Without contextual clues – and without an appreciation for how confused young kids can be sometimes – it could sound like this kid is an arrogant know-it-all who thinks he\u0026rsquo;s checkmated biologists and proven that germ theory can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be true. Or that he thinks that he, a mere schoolchild, can come up with a novel way to end all sickness forever that nobody else ever thought of.\nAnd the thesis of this post is that you must never, ever say that. Saying that is so bad. Smack down that student once, say \u0026ldquo;I think I know more about germ theory than you do\u0026rdquo;, make him feel like he challenged your authority and that\u0026rsquo;s bad – and the best case scenario is he will never ask questions to resolve his confusion again. The worst case scenario is that he stops feeling the confusion entirely, or stops thinking of forcing things to fit together and make sense as a desirable goal to have.\nOne of the most important rationalist skills is \u0026ldquo;noticing your confusion\u0026rdquo;. But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought. And interpreting an attempt to explore dissonance as a status grab that needs to be knocked down is absolutely fatal for that skill. Instead, you need to think of it as Socratic grilling – like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly.\nTolerating this is harder than it sounds. Most people can stay helpful for one or two iterations. But most people are bad at explaining things, so one or two iterations isn\u0026rsquo;t always enough I\u0026rsquo;ve had times when I need five or ten question-answer rounds with a teacher in order to understand what they\u0026rsquo;re telling me. The process sounds a lot like \u0026ldquo;The thing you just said is obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that explanation you gave doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, you\u0026rsquo;re still obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;you keep saying the same thing over and over again, and it keeps being obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s irrelevant to the point that\u0026rsquo;s bothering me\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s also irrelevant, you keep saying an obviously wrong thing\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;Oh! That word means something totally different from what I thought it meant, now your statement makes total sense.\u0026rdquo;\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s harder even than that. Sometimes there is a vast inferential distance (a) between you and the place where your teacher\u0026rsquo;s model makes sense, and you need to go through a process as laborious as converting a religious person to a materialist worldview (or vice versa) before the gap gets closed. The process of learning to really appreciate communism, or libertarianism, or whatever, coming from a diametrically opposed philosophy, looks a lot like dozens of questions about \u0026ldquo;but isn\u0026rsquo;t that an atrocity?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;wouldn\u0026rsquo;t this inevitably lead to dystopia?\u0026rdquo; and hearing what your interlocutor has to answer. It\u0026rsquo;s so, so tempting to round this off to them trying to gotcha you (as indeed sometimes it will be) and assume they\u0026rsquo;re not really committed to trying to understand.\nBibliography References Alexander, Scott. 2020. “Socratic Grilling.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/06/socratic-grilling/.

The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat. The course is delivered in small groups facilitated by a trained instructor. Participants receive reading materials on Dr. John Sarno\u0026rsquo;s and Dr. Howard Schubiner\u0026rsquo;s work to study during the intervention period. The educational sessions are focused on the relationship between psychological stress and pain and are divided in four components according to their content:\nComponent 1: Psycophysiologic Pain Education The mainstay of this component is for the participants to recognize their symptoms as a part of a psychophysiologic mind-body syndrome, as opposed to an exclusively physical etiology. This recognition is accomplished by exploring the history of their pain, identifying \u0026ldquo;inconsistencies\u0026rdquo; in the physical components of their pain (discrepancies in symptom localization and/or temporal occurrence), and acquiring information on the nature of nonspecific chronic back pain itself. Great focus is placed on the role of the relationship of underlying psychological stressors to physical pain. As participants are encouraged to examine the origin of the pain, they notice patterns in the experience of their pain that reflect the contribution of psychological and stress-related factors (e.g. experiencing severe back pain when driving but only when in heavy traffic, pain that occurs with sitting but not when sitting on a chairlift during recreational skiing, pain that is worse while walking into the workplace but fine when walking upon exiting). Hereby, participants gain awareness of the connection between pain and psychological processes and a better understanding of the variety of potentially modifiable factors that contribute to chronic back pain.\nExamples:\nIn the above example of an inconsistency, a participant complaining about back pain when driving, was able to identify that he was experiencing pain only while driving on busy roads and not on less busy roads. As a next step, the participant was able to recognize both the role of stress and the underlying emotion of anger that occurred when driving on a busy road. As the participant became able to recognize the feeling of anger in this situation, his pain during driving dissipated. This, in turn, provided insight into his pain in other circumstances and his overall pain resolved over time in conjunction with the other components of this program.\nAnother participant experienced pain while sitting, yet upon reflection, she recognized there were times when sitting did not cause pain such as when she was knitting (an activity she loved to do and which she found relaxing). During the course of this program, she was able to recognize this \u0026ldquo;inconsistency\u0026rdquo; as well as others and worked on desensitization (see component II). Additionally, she was able to realize that she put tremendous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother and wife. As she learned to be more accepting of herself, her unrealistic expectations of herself were reduced as was her pain experience.\nComponent 2: Desensitization and Returning to Physical Activity One of the main contributors hypothesized to contribute to chronic pain derived from psychophysiologic causes is that pain becomes a conditioned response to a physical trigger. According to the classical conditioning model, previously neutral stimuli can become linked to the pain experience. Thus, without the need for a current nociceptive input, this association can be coupled with physical reactions ultimately leading to pain. For example, formerly elicited pain-induced muscle tensions can become associated with other stimuli like sitting or walking and lead to fear and avoidance of these positions/movements. This association can result in fear of recreating pain and thus avoidance of these movements Therefore, one of the key components of our therapy program is to \u0026ldquo;desensitize\u0026rdquo; the participants and break the cycle of pain. In order to achieve this goal, multiple desensitization techniques are utilized in this phase.\nVisual motor imagery (mental simulation of a painful situation) is a desensitization technique during which the participant is asked to first visualize a movement where pain typically occurs. Often (though not universally) the visualization will bring on pain. When this occurs, this serves to help the participant recognize that the pain can be elicited simply in his or her mind without any physical movement. This concept helps support the fact that the pain is psychophysiologic in nature. Next, the person is encouraged to repeatedly visualize the movement which caused pain while they are repeating self-soothing statements. With these repeated visualizations (without physical movement), the pain can ultimately wane and cannot be reproduced using visualization alone. When this process is complete (and pain can no longer be elicited), the patient can then proceed with slowly undertaking the actual movements/positions (see example below).\nAdditionally, identifying conditioned responses in daily life is a crucial part of this phase. For example, if sitting were a trigger, one would sit with the knowledge that the pain associated with sitting is a conditioned response and not actually related to some physical injury or component of sitting. Over time, the pain will dissipate, and the conditioning will be effectively reversed, allowing the participant to return to full physical activity. By returning to previous physical activity, patients also reinforce the \u0026ldquo;knowledge therapy\u0026rdquo; component as they begin to recognize that pain is not actually related to physical triggers per se, but rather psychological triggers. The safety of participants during this process is ensured through the gradual increase of activity under the supervision of a physician (see examples below).\nExample:\nA participant reported having pain with prolonged standing and notably when standing at a bus stop waiting for work. She attributed the pain to the physical activity of prolonged standing. Occasionally, she would return home and miss work because of the severity of the pain. During our program, she first visualized standing at the bus stop, and this reproduced her pain and discomfort. The ability for her to bring on severe pain simply through visualization allowed her to recognize the psychological component of her pain. She then reflected further on the situation from a different perspective and recognized that she was under a great degree of psychological stress while at the bus stop anticipating her day at work. With all this in mind, she first performed visual motor imagery repeatedly over a few days using self-soothing techniques until she reached the point that she could no longer reproduce the pain during visualization. Then, she stood at the bus stop reminding herself that the origin of the pain was not the physical act of standing. Over time, she stood for longer periods of time and the pain decreased despite the overall increase in physical activity. Ultimately, the pain resolved to the point where prolonged standing was no longer a trigger for her pain.\nComponent 3: Emotional Expression - Psycology of the Syndrome Reports on \u0026ldquo;functional\u0026rdquo; back pain conditions date back from as early as 1946 (1). The notion that chronic pain may persist as a manifestation of unexpressed negative affective states (e.g. hostility or aggressive impulses that the individual is unwilling or unable to acknowledge) was formulated in 1959 (2). Taking into consideration that some of the contributors to persistent pain include underlying stressful conflicts and aversive affective states, strategies encouraging emotional expression are essential in the treatment of mind-body syndrome. Emotional expression is accomplished through a series of writing exercises and journaling (free writing, cluster writing, letters of forgiveness, gratitude lists), self-reflection, as well as through small group discussion. A recent treatment developed by Drs. Schubiner and Lumley, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), includes similar techniques (3).\nAs an example, a participant realized during the above-mentioned exercises that he was being negatively impacted by the emotional pain caused by the imminent ending of his marriage. As he began to express his emotions, he noticed a significant reduction in his physical pain. Another example noted earlier was a patient who developed severe pain when driving on crowded streets but not on roads without traffic. He ultimately recognized that he was experiencing anger and frustration in a number of specific situations such as being stuck in traffic. This awareness of anger-related contributions to his pain (rather than an exclusively physical explanation that sitting for long periods results in mechanically induced increases in pain) and subsequent expression of those negative emotions helped the patient to improve his pain.\nComponent 4: Stress reduction - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) As stress is an underlying component of MBS, the final arm of the program is to engage in stress-reduction techniques. By starting this program with the PSRT portion, participants are often already seeing improvements before embarking on this last portion of the program. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for the prevention and treatment of stress related disorders (4). MBSR has been linked to significant improvements in overall health and well-being, leading to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain (5, 6, 7). MBSR is an 8-week educational program which includes weekly sessions and mindful practice. Students are encouraged to perform daily home practice, which is explored throughout the program. Our MBSR classes adhered to the original protocol of the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. Our mindfulness sessions entail a series of strategies for cultivating present moment awareness - the ability to experience what is arising in the present moment. This allows for the observation of thoughts (past or future), the disengagement from emotional reactivity and the ability to stay with the sensate experience in the body - the outcome of which is a deeper sense of ease, emotional balance and general well-being.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:donninoPsychophysiologicSymptomReliefTherapyChronicBackPainPilotRandomizedControlled2021 Backlinks Psychophysiologic symptom relief therapy ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/38bba771-d7e5-467f-80bb-ebd79faf793c/","summary":"(NO_ITEM_DATA:donninoPsychophysiologicSymptomReliefTherapyChronicBackPainPilotRandomizedControlled2021)\nPsychophysiologic Symptom Relief Therapy Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Notes PSRT is a treatment program designed for patients with non-specific chronic back pain.

Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they\u0026rsquo;re working on the right problems. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you\u0026rsquo;re working on the wrong thing.\nThe Technologist\u0026rsquo;s trap; Solve the problem.\nLike most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition). This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times. I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does. And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not.\nDiscipline is more effective than motivation\nDon\u0026rsquo;t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that\u0026rsquo;s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you\u0026rsquo;ll be less happy). Don\u0026rsquo;t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either.\nBibliography References Altman, Sam. 2018. “Productivity.” Sam Altman. https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity.

Write a test that will check for new such errors in the project (Den should have written a bash test that would check the encoding in the project files before running all the tests). When configured, CI is a powerful tool for future project participants. If someone in the future wrote one / several (yes, even the entire file) in a different encoding, then he would be stopped by a test that would kindly report the accepted encoding in the project - checkmate.\nDocumentation\nThe accepted encoding is a disciplinary rule in the project. Since the project has readme, it was possible to add a paragraph there about the accepted encoding and possible problems if you deviate from this encoding. After all, new people enter the project just through reading readme(usually it says how to run, which versions to use, possible errors, even the changelog of versions can be seen there). Then, faced with a similar error, the project participant would definitely remember the accepted encoding and fix the problem. Leaving documentation of the project discipline rules in commit messages would not have the same effect.\nA commit message to change a single character is hard-to-find information.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them. The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information. There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; study method, though some are better than others. The study method which will be most effective will depend on the situation in which you will need to recall the information. Terms Testing effect Item-specific processing Relational processing Permastore Thoughts Spaced repetition, which incorporates the Testing effect, seems like a great fit. However, I think it would be easy to create flashcards which aid in memorizing a fact but not in understanding or application. For instance: I could imagine a card which asks you to recall the abstract steps required to multiply a IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix. I think this card, on its own, would not be sufficient to maintain understanding or the ability to perform matrix multiplication. Perhaps you could supplement the card with others which ask:\nWhat conditions are necessary to multiply two matrices (AxB and CxD)? A card, or several, which provide specific examples using numbers rather than generalizations? Perhaps there is a script or addon which allows for this sort of thing. I worry that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough to maintain understanding and the ability to apply this knowledge even with these, and more, cards. It would certainly reduce the barrier to re-entry. I used to understand much more calculus than I could prove to you now after letting it fall out of my mind since college. Keeping up with calculus topics, example problems, definitions, etc, through it would at least make it easier for me to jump back in should the need arise. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be as \u0026ldquo;on the ball\u0026rdquo; as I would if I were actively using and practicing calculus regularly, but I would be at a better place than I am now.\nMemory in Educational Settings Guiding Theoretical Principles Introducing \u0026ldquo;Desirable Difficulties\u0026rdquo; During Learning Performance during learning is a poor predictor of future performance because it reflects the momentary accessibility of knowledge (i.e., retrieval strength) rather than how well it has been stored in memory (i.e., storage strength)\nStorage strength increases when a memory is retrieved or the event is reexperienced.\n[I]f knowledge is to be retained over long periods of time, then the goal of learning must be to increase storage strength, not momentary accessibility.\nBased on the distinction between retrieval strength and storage strength, R. A. Bjork and colleagues developed the concept of \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulties\u0026rdquo; in learning (Bjork, 1994a, 1994b; Christina \u0026amp; Bjork, 1991; Schmidt \u0026amp; Bjork, 1992). The main idea is that introducing difficulties during learning will result in superior long-term retention because the greatest gains in storage strength occur when retrieval strength is low. For example, consider the practice of using flash cards to study vocabulary words. If you study a word and then try to remember it immediately, then the gain in storage strength will be relatively low because it is so easy to retrieve the word right away (retrieval strength is high). However, if you wait 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the word (when retrieval strength will be lower), then the gain in storage strength will be larger. The implication for educational practice is that instead of arranging the conditions of learning to be easier and faster for the learner, educators should introduce difficulties into the learning process in order to promote long-term retention of knowledge.\nProcessing Information to Extract Meaning Critically, directing attention at a lower or \u0026ldquo;shallow\u0026rdquo; level of processing (e.g., focusing on the orthography of words while reading) disrupts higher or \u0026ldquo;deeper\u0026rdquo; levels of processing (e.g., determining what those words mean). As a result, the type of processing in which one consciously engages determines what information will be encoded into memory and retained. The type of processing is more important than the intent to learn (e.g., Craik \u0026amp; Tulving, 1975); the implication is that a student who deliberately prepares for a test but who does not engage in deep processing will not do as well as the student who processes the material deeply, even if the latter student is not deliberately trying to learn the material.\nOne helpful distinction involves item- specific processing versus relational processing (Hunt \u0026amp; Einstein, 1981). Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.\nIn contrast, relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other. In short, both item-specific and relational processing can involve meaning extraction, but they direct the learner to different aspects of the to-be- remembered events.\nImportance of Match Between Processing at Encoding and Retrieval Rather, memory performance is the joint product of the way in which the memory was encoded (i.e., the memory trace that is stored) and the way in which it is retrieved (i.e., the cues provided) (e.g., Tulving \u0026amp; Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving \u0026amp; Osler, 1968). This idea is codified in the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, which states that memory performance will be enhanced to the extent that the processes engaged during initial learning match the processes required for the criterial task\nIn short, there is not always a single right answer about which study strategy will be best. Rather, as reflected in ideas about transfer-appropriate processing, the ideal study strategy depends upon what the student will need to do later.\nSummary We have presented three general cognitive principles that are critical for determining memory performance in educational settings:\nintroducing desirable difficulties during learning engaging in processes that emphasize meaning extraction and matching learning processes to the processes needed to excel on the final criterial task (i.e., transfer-appropriate processing). Learning Strategies for Studying Material Receiving Advance Organizers Highlighting and Underlining Note Taking Although note taking yields memorial benefits, the type of notes naturally taken may not be the most powerful Mnemonic possible. One issue involves how much note taking involves going beyond the to-be-remembered information (versus simply copying; see Marsh \u0026amp; Sink, 2010), including paraphrasing the to-be-remembered information and connecting it to stored knowledge. Returning to the levels of processing framework, the key issue is the depth of processing note taking naturally affords. We have just reviewed evidence that note taking encourages relational processing that affords transfer. Nevertheless, additional benefit may come from techniques that encourage the reader or listener to process the material even more deeply. For example, King (1992) trained students to summarize material, specifically how to identify and encapsulate the main idea. This group of students was compared to another group who took notes naturally, and who later had a chance to review those notes. Students who summarized the lecture performed better on both immediate and delayed comprehension tests than students who took notes (see Bretzing \u0026amp; Kulhavy, 1979, for similar results). Similarly, the note-taking group did not do as well as a group of students trained to ask themselves (and answer) questions about the material. Students might benefit from incorporating some of these deep processing techniques into their notes; in other words, training might help students to take notes that include more of the generative processing thought to be key for transfer (e.g., Peper \u0026amp; Mayer, 1978).\nLearning Strategies for Poststudy Retrieval Practice \u0026hellip; memory research has shown that retrieving information from memory actually changes memory (e.g., Bjork, 1975), improving long-term retention of the material\nThe finding that retrieval practice produces superior long-term retention has been termed the Testing effect\nWhen testing is used as a learning tool in educational settings, there are several ways in which its efficacy can be enhanced.\nTests that require students to produce a response, such as short-answer and essay tests, generally lead to better retention than tests that simply require the selection of the correct response, such as multiple-choice tests and true/false tests. Taking multiple tests results in better retention than taking a single test, so it is beneficial to repeat questions on quizzes and give cumulative exams. Successful retrieval is the key to learning from tests, so providing feedback after the test is essential, especially if test-takers do not retrieve many correct responses (paraphrased)\nProcessing Feedback to Correct Errors The most consistent result is that providing learners with the correct answer in the feedback message produces better subsequent performance than simply indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect (e.g., Pashler et al., 2005; for a meta-analysis, see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, \u0026amp; Morgan, 1991). This finding makes sense because informing the learner that a given response is incorrect will not help the learner to correct the error if the learner does not have any recourse to learn the correct answer.\nSpacing Out Practice Over Time \u0026hellip; [I]t seems that the optimal interval depends on how long the knowledge needs to be retained after the last practice (i.e., the retention interval). Cepeda and colleagues (2006; see also Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, \u0026amp; Pashler, 2008) performed a meta-analysis that included 317 experiments from 184 articles on the Spacing effect. They found that the optimal spacing interval is approximately 10%–20% of the retention interval. Thus, if the goal is to retain the material for 5 days, then practice should be spaced over intervals between 12 and 24 hours\nCombining Techniques Applying the Guiding Principles and Learning Strategies in Educational Settings Long-Term Learning Learning Beyond Facts \u0026hellip; [I]n the classroom, educators have many different goals for their students, and these goals vary as a function of the level of education, the type of course, and the time frame given for learning, among many other factors. One way of categorizing these goals is through Bloom\u0026rsquo;s Taxonomy (1956) of educational objectives, which conceptualizes learning as a hierarchy in which the various levels must be mastered in sequential order. The cognitive domain is comprised of six levels (from lowest to highest):\nknowledge (e.g., learning facts, concepts, etc.) comprehension (e.g., understanding the relationship between ideas) application (e.g., using knowledge to solve new problems) analysis (e.g., finding evidence to support a hypothesis) synthesis (e.g., combining different accounts of an event to understand what occurred) evaluation (e.g., assessing the validity of an idea according to certain criteria) Permastore\nThe Relativity of Memory Bibliography References Marsh, Elizabeth J., and Andrew C.

Not only they have weak coding skills but there are also a few other things that give Junior developers away:\nTheir main mantra is \u0026ldquo;making it work\u0026rdquo; without giving much attention to how the solution is achieved. To them, a working software and good software are equivalent. They usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something. They suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members. Most of the Junior developers just try to live up to the role and, when stuck, they might leave work for a senior developer instead of at least trying to take a stab at something. They don\u0026rsquo;t know about the business side of the company and don\u0026rsquo;t realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and they don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain. Over-engineering is a major problem, often leading to fragility and bugs. When given a problem, they often try to fix just the current problem a.k.a. fixing the symptoms instead of fixing the root problem. You might notice the \u0026ldquo;Somebody Else\u0026rsquo;s Problem\u0026rdquo; behavior from them. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what or how much they don\u0026rsquo;t know, thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect. They don\u0026rsquo;t take initiatives and they might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase. They don\u0026rsquo;t participate in team discussions. Mid Level Developers The next level after the Junior developers is Mid Level developers. They are technically stronger than the Junior developers and can work with minimal supervision. They still have some issues to address in order to jump to Senior level.\nMid-level developers are quite common. Most of the organizations wrongly label them as \u0026ldquo;Senior Developers\u0026rdquo;. However, they need further mentoring in order to become Senior Developers.\nSenior Developers Senior developers are the next level after the Mid-level developers. They are the people who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road. They are more mature, have gained experience by delivering both good and bad software in the past and have learned from it — they know how to be pragmatic. Here is the list of things that are normally expected of a Senior Developer:\nWith their past experiences, mistakes made, issues faced by over-designed or under-designed software, they can foresee the problems and persuade the direction of the codebase or the architecture. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;Shiny-Toy\u0026rdquo; syndrome. They are pragmatic in the execution. They can make the tradeoffs when required, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic. They have a good picture of the field, know what the best tool for the job is in most cases (even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the tool). They have the innate ability to pick up a new tool/language/paradigm/etc in order to solve a problem that requires it. They are aware they\u0026rsquo;re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs to taking un-glorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done. They have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development. They don\u0026rsquo;t make empty complaints, they make judgments based on the empirical evidence and they have suggestions for solutions. They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code. They have the ability to take on large ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract, and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them. They have respect for the code that was written before them. They are generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. They approach inheriting legacy code with an \u0026ldquo;opportunity mindset\u0026rdquo; rather than a complaining one. They know how to give feedback without hurting anyone.

We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal. We do any number of things. But we do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions that would effectively optimize for our claimed goals, or for any other goals.\nThoughts We don\u0026rsquo;t automatically seek out a Theory of change. Instead, we see the greatest improvements through increased pattern matching such that our default habits and instincts are better aligned with the optimal strategy.\nNotes Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a \u0026ldquo;fear of success\u0026rdquo;; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)\nWhy do most of us, most of the time, choose to \u0026ldquo;pursue our goals\u0026rdquo; through routes that are far less effective than the routes we could find if we tried? My guess is that here, as with the calculus test, the main problem is that most courses of action are extremely ineffective, and that there has been no strong evolutionary or cultural force sufficient to focus us on the very narrow behavior patterns that would actually be effective.\nTo be more specific: there are clearly at least some limited senses in which we have goals. We: (1) tell ourselves and others stories of how we\u0026rsquo;re aiming for various \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;; (2) search out modes of activity that are consistent with the role, and goal-seeking, that we see ourselves as doing (\u0026ldquo;learning math\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;becoming a comedian\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;being a good parent\u0026rdquo;); and sometimes even (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do/don\u0026rsquo;t achieve our \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;.\nBut there are clearly also heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement (or that would be part of what it means to \u0026ldquo;have goals\u0026rdquo; at all) that we do not automatically carry out. We do not automatically:\n(a) Ask ourselves what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (\u0026ldquo;what does it look like to be a good comedian?\u0026rdquo;) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven\u0026rsquo;t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren\u0026rsquo;t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don\u0026rsquo;t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that isn\u0026rsquo;t going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our \u0026ldquo;goal\u0026rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won\u0026rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting; \u0026hellip;. or carry out any number of other useful techniques.

A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people. An essay is stronger when it can afford to omit qualification (eg: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps\u0026rdquo;). Additionally, for Graham, a useful essay is one which says things as simply as possible.\nThoughts Notes What should an essay be? [\u0026hellip;] useful.\nUseful writing tells people something true and important that they didn\u0026rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\nIn effect the [novelty, correctness, importance, and strength] are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.\n[\u0026hellip;] if you write a bad sentence, you don\u0026rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a trick for getting importance too. It\u0026rsquo;s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they\u0026rsquo;ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\nThe way to get novelty is to write about topics you\u0026rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who\u0026rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n[\u0026hellip;] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. [\u0026hellip;] As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you\u0026rsquo;re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm\u0026rsquo;s length with perhapses.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It\u0026rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it\u0026rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader\u0026rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that\u0026rsquo;s too long.\nSometimes the reason people don\u0026rsquo;t know something is because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to know it.\nBibliography References Graham, Paul. n.d. “How to Write Usefully.” Accessed February 7, 2022. http://paulgraham.com/useful.html.

[\u0026hellip;] I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to fully understand these people and I apologize for any misrepresentations I might be making. But the short version is: they all agree that everything went wrong when we switched from saturated to unsaturated fat.\nIt stands out because Scott specifically mentions the edge of his research and yet published the piece anyway. There is a loud voice in the back of my head whenever I\u0026rsquo;m writing anything \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; which drives me to go deeper and that stones left unturned will mar my writing. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend anyone to actually listen to this voice but it\u0026rsquo;s damn loud and I\u0026rsquo;m glad to see a concrete example of someone ignoring it.\n\u0026ldquo;Processed\u0026rdquo; Food What food counts as \u0026ldquo;processed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not processed\u0026rdquo;?\nI found myself nodding along to this paragraph as I read. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the same thought with the same (inferred) sense of exasperation.\nNotes In the 1800s, the average US man weighed about (a) 155 lbs. Today, he weighs about 195. The change is even starker at the extremes. Someone at the 90th percentile of weight back then weighed about 185 lbs; today, he would weigh 320 lbs. Back then, about 1% (a) of men were obese. Today, about 25% are.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe answer to all these questions seems to be something like \u0026ldquo;the body is pretty good at regulating its own weight under any diet except modern American processed food.\u0026rdquo; But what aspect of processed food makes it bad?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe only common villain everyone agrees on in the obesity story is \u0026ldquo;processed food\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve previously found this frustrating – it reeks of a sort of unreflective technophobia. What part of processing makes food bad? How does mere contact with a machine turn food from healthy to unhealthy? What food counts as \u0026ldquo;processed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not processed\u0026rdquo;? Is ground beef processed, since you grind it? Are scrambled eggs processed, since you scramble them? Is bread processed, since wheat doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow in loaves? Is water processed, since it goes through water processing facilities? Is the Eucharist processed, even though the processing only changes its metaphysical essence and not its physical properties? Everybody I ask acts like the answers to these questions are obvious, but everyone has different answers, and nobody can tell me their decision procedure.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut how could that be? If people used to be thin and healthy, we should just be able to do what they were doing! And then that would be the diet that can consistently lose weight and keep it off!\nI can only see three ways out of this paradox.\nFirst, conventional wisdom is right about everything. People are fatter today than in the 1800s because they eat too much and exercise too little. They eat too much because they are rich, food is cheap, and food tastes really good. They exercise too little because they\u0026rsquo;re office workers now instead of farmers. In this model, the reason the efficient market hasn\u0026rsquo;t found the secret to weight loss is because there\u0026rsquo;s no secret and weight loss is really hard. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard for your great-grandfather because he had fewer options and so he didn\u0026rsquo;t need to exercise willpower to avoid the bad ones. The most sophisticated version of this model, so sophisticated that maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it this model at all, is the food reward theory ably defended by Stephan Guyenet (a).\nThis has a lot going for it, but can\u0026rsquo;t be quite right. Exercise seems like a red herring; studies of how much people eat, exercise, and gain weight have shown (a) that dietary changes explain more than 100% of weight gain over the past 30-40 years \u0026ndash; probably we are exercising a little more. And there was really tasty food in 1800s America and 1970s France, so how come people didn\u0026rsquo;t overindulge in that? How does it explain all the weird results like lab animals, pets, and feral rats gaining weight (a)? This probably part of it, but it still feels like something\u0026rsquo;s missing.\nSecond, diet is barely related to the obesity epidemic, and it\u0026rsquo;s being caused by plastics or antibiotics affecting the microbiome or something like that. This is another thing where I would have expected people to notice, but I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want to dismiss it prematurely.\nThird, it\u0026rsquo;s a ratchet. Departing from the ways of our ancestors (or great-grandparents) can make you obese, but returning to their ways cannot make you thin again. A bad diet (whatever that is) shifts your weight set point up, but a good diet does not shift it back down, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. It just prevents further damage.\nThis contradicts the evidence from some people who do manage to lose weight, including some people who manage to lose a lot of weight and keep it off. I think the theory would have to be that different people\u0026rsquo;s set points are differently malleable, and that some people are obese because their set point is set to obese, and other people barely have a set point and are mostly operating on calories-in-calories-out. If this seems a little too convenient an assumption, keep in mind this is how lots of other set points work – some people will gain tolerance to certain drugs almost instantly, and other people will never get it at all.\nOverall I am ending this research more confused than when I started it. I think the most likely dietary change I make is to try to avoid foods with soybean, corn, or safflower oil, since this is probably a good stand-in for \u0026ldquo;foods processed enough that they count as processed foods and you should avoid them\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the evidence is good for avoiding fish oil and olive oil, and there\u0026rsquo;s enough evidence from elsewhere that these foods are healthy that I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep trying to eat them. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the evidence is good for saturated fats being especially good, and there seems to be at least equally strong evidence that they\u0026rsquo;re bad, so although I\u0026rsquo;m not going to work too hard to avoid them I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not going to optimize my diet for getting as many of them as possible.\nBibliography References Alexander, Scott. 2020. “For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/10/for-then-against-high-saturated-fat-diets/.

I recall them mentioning pattern matching explicitly; though I\u0026rsquo;ve since lost the reference.\nNotes [\u0026hellip;] the notion that \u0026rsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching\u0026rsquo; [\u0026hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I\u0026rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.\nThe first idea is the \u0026lsquo;recognition-primed decision making\u0026rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses. I\u0026rsquo;ve written extensively about the model on this blog, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to repeat myself (read this instead (a)) but the core of it is simply that expertise is an implicit memory operation (a): you recognise a situation in a developing environment and then unspool that recognition into a set of cues, a list of plausible goals, and handful of expectancies, and a series of trained actions. If the situation is novel, you construct variants of intended actions on the fly and simulate these scenarios in a loop, picking the first workable solution in your mind.\nThis model of expert decision-making is useful because it gives us a usable model of expertise — far better than the ones found in the deliberate practice literature. For example, one conclusion from this model is that if you want to become better at something, you should look for ways to expand the set of recognisable prototypes in your head.\nThe second idea is simply that expertise rests on technê, or Tacit knowledge \u0026mdash; the sort of knowledge that is impossible to communicate, that must be constructed from practice. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this idea numerous times over the past two years: first in my original criticism (a) of mental model writing, then in my reflection on Seymour Papert\u0026rsquo;s life\u0026rsquo;s work (a). I covered it again in The Mental Model FAQ (a) and The Dangers of Treating Ideas from Finance as Generalised Self Help (a). I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it here and there throughout Commonplace\u0026rsquo;s history; indeed, my reliance on technê is one of the big pieces of idea scaffolding for this blog.\n[emphasis mine]\n[\u0026hellip;] perhaps the art of practice is simply whatever is the most effective method of expanding one\u0026rsquo;s collection of recognisable prototypes (and of course: the actions to take in response to those recognisable prototypes).\nWhat about creativity, for instance? Klein covers this in his research; in Sources of Power he discusses how expert minds use pattern-recognition to identify \u0026rsquo;leverage points\u0026rsquo; — points in which one could do something radically different — in order to come up with creative solutions within the constraints of some domain. I\u0026rsquo;ve dug a little into the research and I think the take is plausible, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely convinced. Surely the mechanism of creativity is different from the prototype-based recognition that drives most of expertise? The short answer to that seems to be \u0026lsquo;yes, creativity relies on connections between different ideas and this is independent of expertise\u0026rsquo; but also \u0026lsquo;identifying the right leverage points is still a recognition/expertise thing\u0026rsquo;. The two seem highly intertwined in the sorts of fields that Klein studies; my remaining scepticism is that I do not know if this is true in \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; creative domains like art and design and fiction writing.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:chinExpertiseJustPatternMatching2020 Backlinks Cedric Chin | The Tacit Knowledge Series Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame Daniel Kahneman, Gary Klein | Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree Anna Salamon | Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic Skills of a senior software engineer Todos Recognition-primed decision Gary Klein and Jennifer Phillips and Erica Rall and Deborah Peluso | A Data-Frame Theory of Sensemaking ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/b481f4e5-63b4-4455-8406-49825121b06c/","summary":"Cedric Chin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:chinExpertiseJustPatternMatching2020)\nSummary \u0026ldquo;Expertise\u0026rdquo; is an Emergent property of pattern matching.\nBeing an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at:\nrecognizing situations knowing how to respond to those situations Simple, right?\nThoughts The idea rings true to me when I think about how chess masters describe thinking about the game in the moment.

The solution here is to use normal problem-solving techniques. Put a sign in the bedroom saying \u0026ldquo;DID YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT?\u0026rdquo; or something. Whatever.\nUnsolvable conflicts are temporary manifestations of deep psychological issues. The particular thing that sparked the fight this time is irrelevant, but both spouses will fight to the death because it represents something important. For example, the husband is late to dinner one night because he went out to the bar. The wife yells at him and says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about her. He yells back that she\u0026rsquo;s a control freak. Here the problem will not be solved by coming up with a compromise where he can go to the bar half of nights. The problem is that she secretly worries his drinking buddies have a closer connection to him than she ever will, that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t love her anymore, that he goes to the bar to escape her. He worries that he\u0026rsquo;s lost his freedom, that he\u0026rsquo;s become emasculated, that he\u0026rsquo;s become some boring old person who is never allowed to have fun. If the bar burnt down tomorrow, they would find some other excuse to fight over this dynamic.\nDesperation breeds gullibility. Patients with terminal diseases, however smart they used to be, turn to homeopaths and charlatans rather than face the dismal truth.\n[\u0026hellip;] whenever I hear people talk about relationships, I hear weird echoes of political problems. People who hate their spouse have an outgroup of one. A unified polity has devolved into partisanship. Social trust has been broken; a defect-defect equilibrium is in place. Gottman thinks of couples as a two-person culture, and some of those cultures are decadent and fractious.\nIn marriage, as in other forms of politics, sometimes exit \u0026gt; voice. Which is probably not something marriage counselors want to think about very much.\nBibliography References NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewSevenPrinciplesMakingMarriageWork2020 ","permalink":"http://notes.cashpw.com/posts/0bbaf0b3-afed-49e2-a5f5-61c0a0cff973/","summary":"Scott Alexander, (NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderBookReviewSevenPrinciplesMakingMarriageWork2020) , The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work (a)\nSummary The legend of John Gottman\u0026rsquo;s marriage counselling success isn\u0026rsquo;t supported by the underlying research at a statistical level; however, the techniques he advocates may help anyway.\nThoughts I enjoyed the personality that this essay had.

And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere\u0026rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you\u0026rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the main reason that speed is important.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren\u0026rsquo;t just about churning out work—they\u0026rsquo;re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.\nIn other words, the main benefit of being fast is that you end up doing different things. Nelson Elhage\u0026rsquo;s point—\u0026ldquo;having faster tools changes how users use a tool\u0026rdquo;—applies across nearly every domain:\nIf you respond to your emails quickly instead of slowly, you\u0026rsquo;ll get access to more new opportunities, and end up prioritizing them over whatever you would have done instead. If you make it 10x faster to test your code, you don\u0026rsquo;t just save time waiting on tests—you can start doing test-driven development, discover your mistakes earlier, and save yourself from going down bad paths. If you deploy your new app now instead of next week, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how users like the new features one week earlier, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to feed that knowledge back into future product decisions. That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn\u0026rsquo;t just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. Over time, that makes an enormous difference.\nBibliography References Kuhn, Ben. 2020. “Be Impatient.” https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/.

I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.\nWondrous The Space Within The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.\nThe task was to make a cylinder. The word \u0026ldquo;pot\u0026rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.\nBeginnings and Endings The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.\nThe variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.\nCylinders as Pots The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.\nOf particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.\nThe cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).\nFigure 44\nPitchers It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.\nA useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.\nIf you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.\nBowls Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.\nPots with Lids Learning to See Style and Voice Utility and Tradition Place Notes Bibliography References Illian, Clary. 2012. A Potter’s Workbook.

Byrne Hobart (a)\n\u0026ldquo;50%+ focus\u0026rdquo; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start habitually asking \u0026ldquo;how could this go faster?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\nAs a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I\u0026rsquo;d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.\nIn the short term, this made me less efficient, because I\u0026rsquo;d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I\u0026rsquo;d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner\u0026rsquo;s API in a fit of rage.

I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words.

Theory of change is a funny phrase — I first heard it in the nonprofit community, but it\u0026rsquo;s also widespread in politics and really applies to just about everything. Unfortunately, very few people seem to be very good at it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a concrete example. Imagine you want to decrease the size of the defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look around at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of decreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a blog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your friends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you\u0026rsquo;re a professional writer, you might write a book on the subject. If you\u0026rsquo;re an academic, you might publish some papers. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this strategy a \u0026ldquo;theory of action\u0026rdquo;: you work forwards from what you know how to do to try to find things you can do that will accomplish your goal.\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026rdquo; A decrease in the defense budget: how does one achieve that?\nBibliography References Swartz, Aaron. 2010. “Theory of Change.” http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange.

It\u0026rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.

Large quotes have their benefits and are simple to capture using bookmarklets (Porter 2022).\nNodes can just be a quote Quotes can live in stand-alone single nodes (eg: The First Lesson). This is multi-purpose:\nWhen in doubt, make the node smaller. Easier to link to specific quotes: Suppose a reader clicks on a link and arrives on a page with five quotes visible. This may confuse the reader. Which of the visible quotes is the one to which the link pointed? Works in a transclusion model better than larger nodes Links Preserve links in the original quote to point to the original location or to a node representing the same idea. Wrap added links with square brackets just as you would with additional text. Links Show favicons alongside links Favicons are nice additions to links. They provide visual context to where the reader expects the link to take them. Include them alongside external links.

This is one of my Favorites.\nSpaced repetition is how I bring intention to memory: I remember the things I choose to remember, rather than only the things I happen to remember. It aids in making learning and memory conscious, effortful, process.\nNote The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. Spaced repetition is capable of aiding both remembering names and deeper understanding. However, the two require different approaches:\nRemember something when prompted (e.g. knowing the definition of a word while reading) Bring an idea to mind in context (e.g. using a word while writing) It\u0026rsquo;s most effective when the practice mirrors, as closely as is possible, the way the knowledge will be applied (see also Desirable difficulty).\nTools My preferred solution is org-fc. However, Anki is, as far as I can tell, the most popular and well known. I used Anki exclusively prior to switching to org-fc.\nWhy isn\u0026rsquo;t spaced repetition more popular? As far as I can tell, from my own experience and reading what others have written on the topic:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not popular because it isn\u0026rsquo;t popular\nPeople are not strategic by default and aren\u0026rsquo;t likely to go out on their own to pursue novel (to them at least) ways of doing something. They\u0026rsquo;re much more likely to do what they see others doing.\nOther, more popular, learning methods work well enough\nSpaced repetition isn\u0026rsquo;t the only effective way to learn a topic. Additionally, those alternatives often feel better in the moment or give the impression that they\u0026rsquo;re more effective:\nOf course, [cramming] is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can\u0026rsquo;t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I\u0026rsquo;m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠\nBecause it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! [\u0026hellip;]\n(NO_ITEM_DATA:branwenSpacedRepetitionEfficientLearning2009)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to write good, effective, cards\nOne reason this can be frustrating is you\u0026rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you\u0026rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.\n(Borretti 2023)\nSpaced repetition is a form of delayed gratification\n\u0026ldquo;For spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit\u0026rdquo; (Borretti 2023) and it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult habit to form\nOn writing cards Extend based on (Borretti 2023) Cards should be small Cards, like Evergreen notes, should be atomic; they should test a single, small, idea.\nWrite Atomic Flashcards Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible Approach an idea from more than one direction Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations Write Two-Way Questions On sequences Refer to (Borretti 2023)\nAlso see org-fc\u0026rsquo;s context card\nOn hierarchies Refer to (Borretti 2023)\nBibliography References Borretti, Fernando. 2023. “Effective Spaced Repetition.” Fernando Borretti. https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition. “Spaced Repetition.” 2022.

Imagine you want to decrease the size of the defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look around at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of decreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a blog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your friends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you\u0026rsquo;re a professional writer, you might write a book on the subject. If you\u0026rsquo;re an academic, you might publish some papers. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this strategy a \u0026ldquo;theory of action\u0026rdquo; [Theory of action]: you work forwards from what you know how to do to try to find things you can do that will accomplish your goal.\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026rdquo;\n(Swartz 2010)\nSteps These steps are based on (NO_ITEM_DATA:HowDoesTheoryChangeWork). The ordering, with the exception of starting from Goals, is a recommendation as opposed to a hard rule.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.\nNote that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.\nWhy Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.\nI expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment. I chose to attempt a sleep schedule called dual core (a), which has 5.5 sleeping hours per day, as it was supposed2 to be possible to maintain the schedule indefinitely.\nSleep Schedule Hours Awake Per Day Expected Years Left1 Expected Waking Years Left Monophasic 15 50.4 31.50 Dual Core 1 18.5 50.4 38.85 As the table indicates: sleeping for 3.5 fewer hours daily equates to an increased waking-time life expectancy of 7.35 years. But what would I do with those hours?\nGiven that this was a trial, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time. I expected that I would be exhausted as I adapted (a) to the new sleep schedule.\nThe Trial Sleep Schedule The dual core (a) sleep schedule I attempted was composed of three sleeping times per day.\nName Start time End time Duration (hours) Core 1 22:00 01:30 3.5 Core 2 05:30 07:00 1.5 Nap 13:30 14:00 0.5 I maintained this schedule for 40 days from April 4th, 2021 through June 13th, 2021.\nMeasuring the Impact I opted to do no cognitive tests, etc, during this trial. I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.\nRetrospective How I Felt Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is repartitioning (a). In short, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases3. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it\u0026rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.\nNonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (531 (a)), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I\u0026rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.\nOverall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn\u0026rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I\u0026rsquo;d say that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a negative impact.\nPhysical Symptoms Sleepiness Suprisingly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired \u0026ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.\nDifficulty Waking Up I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (\u0026gt;25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.\n\u0026ldquo;Third Person\u0026rdquo; Feelings Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m watching a TV show right now\u0026rdquo; before the show is over? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.\nI would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; of myself rather than just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.\nHeadaches I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I\u0026rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren\u0026rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.\nSticking to the Schedule Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc4. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using Sleep as Android (a) and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.\nQuality of Sleep I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.\nSleep as Android tracks the duration of \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; (a) and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.\nHow I Seemed to Those Around Me I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she\u0026rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.\nSleep Schedule Going Forward I\u0026rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.\nI had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I\u0026rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there\u0026rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.\nMore and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn\u0026rsquo;t have more to show for it. I\u0026rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours. If I don\u0026rsquo;t, then why not just keep sleeping through them?\nTo that end I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my focus from \u0026ldquo;get more hours\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;do more with the hours I have\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll take another look at polyphasic sleep once I get to the point where I feel I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the hours I already have.\nBibliography References Backlinks Matthew D.
