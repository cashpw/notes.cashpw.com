There has been, for instance, a consistent migratory pattern from Ruby to node.js to Go, Rust, and Elixir. At first, each community is defined by its potential. But as that potential is realized, the community begins to be defined by its compromises. That change is felt most keenly by the people who were there first, who remember what it was like when anything seemed possible.

Legibility as faceted: Complements our own experience; allows us to apply it where we see fit  Thoughts This dichotomy reminds me of Unix philosophy; Composability versus monolithic design.\nNotes  In Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; as something a state imposes on its people and resources. It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same1, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.\nOne of Scott\u0026rsquo;s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests. These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.\nAnd so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps. A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand. If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it. Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.\nIn The Image of the City, Kevin Lynch defines \u0026ldquo;legibility\u0026rdquo; as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it. It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.\nLynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they\u0026rsquo;d navigate from one part of the city to another. He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software. [Not in Emacs!]\nThis is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry\u0026rsquo;s continuous attempts to resurrect logical positivism. Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles. As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.\nScott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they\u0026rsquo;re mostly process-oriented (\u0026ldquo;take small steps\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;favor reversibility\u0026rdquo;) and entirely focused on harm reduction. For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe legibility described in Seeing Like a State, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is singular; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator. The legibility described in Image of the City, and offered by Marco Polo, is faceted; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.\nCreating singular legibility is simple: find something that\u0026rsquo;s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it. What\u0026rsquo;s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you\u0026rsquo;d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.\nFaceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively. It\u0026rsquo;s not, however, something we can simply create on our own. Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.\nBut if you, like me, are interested in software, there are no readymade references.5 I believe, however, that the answer lies in articulation points:\n  As we compose our abstractions, we must ensure we create, at regular intervals, interfaces which fully separate our upstream and downstream components. These interfaces not only delineate subgraphs which can be understood in isolation [Black boxes], they represent decision points in our design process. From any given articulation point, we can branch off in a dozen different directions, perhaps even all at once. These are separate interpretations of what the interface represents, each of which can be considered or ignored in isolation.\nThis is more easily said than done. Countless decisions go into every bit of software, but not all of them deserve to be enshrined as an interface. Once used, interfaces ossify. They allow the code on either side to drift apart, to lose consistency in idiom and purpose. If we don\u0026rsquo;t expect an interface to require multiple interpretations, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist. To make the right decision, we must predict the future.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Two Concepts of Legibility.” Accessed November 11, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/two-concepts-of-legibility.html.

In a large skillet, heat a glug of oil or veggie broth over medium. When the pan is hot, add the garlic and sauté until it becomes fragrant. This will take about a minute. Add the mushrooms, tamari, and thyme. Cook, stirring every minute or so, for 6 to 8 minutes or until the mushrooms release their water and a little broth starts to form. Combine the cashews and veggie broth in a high-speed blender and blend until the mixture is completely smooth. This might take up to 5 minutes, depending on the speed and power of your blender. Pour the cashew sauce into the pan with the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for a couple minutes to let the sauce thicken, stirring frequently. Throw in the spinach and stir for another minute. Prepare the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Make sure to do this after your mushroom sauce is ready to go, so the noodles don\u0026rsquo;t sit for too long and start sticking together. Spread a third of the marinara sauce on the bottom of an 8-by-11-inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles. Cover the noodles with half of the mushroom cream. Add a layer of noodles. Use another third of the marinara to cover these noodles. Add the remaining mushroom cream. Add the last layer of noodles and cover it with the remaining marinara sauce.

Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months). Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location). Working software is the primary measure of progress. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

Bad ideas are usually the clichés your brain has been overexposed to.\nOnce the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my guess as to why: Once you\u0026rsquo;ve generated enough bad output, your mind reflexively identifies which elements caused the badness.

You start pattern-matching interesting ideas with greater intuition.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to look at something bad then intuit how to make it better than to make something good out of thin air.\nMost creators resist their bad ideas and never reach the clear water. If you\u0026rsquo;ve opened a blank document, scribbled a few thoughts, then walked away because you weren\u0026rsquo;t struck with gold, then you too never got past it.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nYour work starts as a weak imitation. You identify what makes the imitation weak. You iterate the imitation until it\u0026rsquo;s original.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Creativity Faucet: How to Be More Creative.” n.d.

Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, these lists are basically disjoint!\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMy underlying model is that the problem is one of defaults. Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe solution to this is two-fold - learn to take breaks before being completely drained, so I can resist the default and take rejuvenating actions. And lower the activation energy of rejuvenating actions, to shape the default - making them as close to the default as possible.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been deliberately vague about exactly what to do, I expect this to vary a lot between people - I recommend brainstorming the things that you feel rejuvenated after doing and building a system such that doing those is the default. But, if it helps, this was my process:\nWhen brainstorming what rejuvenated me, I found that being outside, away from screens, and doing something that felt pleasant and virtuous was the best source of rejuvenation per unit time. And an easy way to do this was to go lie down in my garden for 10 minutes and read a physical book (which also meant I began to actually work my way through my to-read list!). And actually doing this initially had high activation energy - I needed to get up to walk to the garden, there was less of a dopamine rush than checking messages, etc. So, for a week, I made a policy of always doing this during breaks and ensured I stuck to it - locking my phone and blocking distracting websites during breaks, having brief pings at the start and end. And I shaped my environment to make it easier, making sure to always have my current book close to hand. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly stick to this, and it took some energy to do. But making it a habit significantly lowered the activation energy, and built positive associations with it, to the point that it now feels way easier. And I don\u0026rsquo;t stick to it religiously, but it\u0026rsquo;s now much easier to do when I feel tired.\n(Nanda n.d.)\n Things I want to do when I feel tired and low energy Things that I feel rejuvenated after having done References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Nanda, Neel. n.d. “Meaningful Rest.” Accessed May 23, 2021. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iYR9hKzTKGhZwTPWK/meaningful-rest.

Discard the water covering the dough and fill the bowl again with cool, clean water. As the new water fills the bowl, begin stretching and kneading the dough. Keeping your hands and dough in the bowl of water, continue kneading and stretching until the water becomes very opaque.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Dump out your milky water, using a colander to catch the dough ball and any stray pieces\n   Cover your dough ball again, this time using luke-warm water, and continue to stretch and knead until the water becomes opaque again. Alternating cool and warm water affects how the dough breaks apart and comes back together again. The goal of this is to hopefully lessen the amount of times you need to wash. However, you can do all cool water and get the same result. It is not recommended to use water that is too warm or hot, because your dough can become stickier or more gluey and harder to work with.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Repeat steps 3 and 4\n   (Le 2021)\n   You will likely need to repeat this process at least few times. You will see the dough begin to look more stringy and feel a little \u0026ldquo;squeaky\u0026rdquo; between your fingers. The more starch you wash out, the more chewy your seitan will become, so the end result is up to you.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWash until the water is at least a little bit cloudy.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Once you have finished washing to your desired level of water clarity, let the dough rest in the colander for at least 20 minutes\n This is to both drain the excess water and let the strands begin to develop. If you are adding additional spices or proteins, proceed to step [7]. If you are not, you should let it rest even longer until the gluten becomes very elastic and you are able to stretch it far without it breaking.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   (optional) Add in seasonings\n A good rule of thumb if adding proteins or liquids is to only add about 2oz to this size dough ball so your seitan does not become too soft. I prefer just adding in dry spices to keep the texture chewier, but you can also add liquids such as soy sauce or liquid smoke to boost flavor, and/or additional proteins such as tofu or beans to soften the texture of your final result and also make your seitan a complete protein. My preferred method for incorporating them is to use a food processor, but you can also cut them into the dough or knead them in by hand. Then you will need to let the dough rest again until it starts to come back together and become more elastic and stretchy. You want it strong enough to knot, even if you do not intend to cook it that way. This usually takes about 20 minutes, but can take up to an hour or so depending on what you\u0026rsquo;ve added. You can also leave it sit overnight so the gluten continues to develop, but that is unnecessary.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   Prepare Seitan for cooking\nStretch and knot (braid) the Seitan dough.\n   (Le 2021)\n   Cook Seitan\nBring enough broth to cover Seitan to a simmer in a pot, then add the Seitan and cook for 2+ hours (depending on the thickness of the dough).\n  Let it rest in the fridge for at least 8 hours\n While you can skip this step, the texture will not have had a chance to completely firm up.\n(Seitan Society n.d.)\n   References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Le, Lisa. 2021. “Washed Flour Seitan Method.” The Viet Vegan. https://thevietvegan.com/washed-flour-seitan-method/.

Indeed, this is part of what makes privilege privilege: it\u0026rsquo;s the identity that\u0026rsquo;s treated as a norm. The one you don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about.\n   The Alt-Right is the gentrification of white nationalism. Their pocket squares and MBAs and $90 haircuts short out the white moderate\u0026rsquo;s brain because they still associate white supremacy with white trash.\n   The boundaries are not policed from the inside.\n   Now, these people frequently are self-identified, card-carrying racists. My point is, for this system of incentives and rewards to operate, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be. Any of them may, but none of them must. Racism exists and it\u0026rsquo;s efficient. And, in a capitalist society, where cops are competing for promotions, private prisons are competing for contracts, and politicians are competing for votes, if an unethical behavior sees a higher return than the alternative… then ethics are a luxury. There are hundreds of examples of businesses that claim, in periods of prosperity, that they prefer to do what is right over what is profitable. But what tune do they play when prosperity ends? Every boom has a bust - since 1900, the US has spent one out of every four years in recession. And, in the lean season, not using this generations-old system built by white people to advantage their descendents is a liability. A values-based business typically goes one of three ways: compromising their values to stay competitive, getting bought by someone who compromised their values to stay competitive, or sticking to their guns and facing a higher risk of going out of business. Many choose to do the right thing, and some even survive. But that\u0026rsquo;s beating the odds. The market trends toward the optimal strategy.\n See also:\n Specifically: Moloch and This is the dreamtime Generally: Systems   [\u0026hellip;] white supremacy is about power.\n   Because, I mean, what if they genuinely believe the Voting Rights Act unfairly targets Southern states? Or even if - and I\u0026rsquo;m saying if here - they did do it to suppress votes, if hurting Black people isn\u0026rsquo;t their goal, and they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to win elections, is that really \u0026ldquo;racist?\u0026rdquo;\nModerates are very cagey about breaking out the R-word for a fellow white person.\nSee, there\u0026rsquo;s this other definition of racism that most white people learn in grade school: racism is when you say mean things to other kids about skin color and it hurts their feelings; racism is about cruelty. And harm done by white people, therefore, isn\u0026rsquo;t racism if isn\u0026rsquo;t cruel; it\u0026rsquo;s merely ignorant. Or apathetic. But ignorance and apathy can be reasoned with; you just gotta sit down and hash it out. As long as it takes. Real white supremacy is about emotional distress or interpersonal violence; it\u0026rsquo;s uncommon, it\u0026rsquo;s unpopular, and it\u0026rsquo;s a hearts and minds issue.\nWhat this definition leaves out is any notion that white supremacy is about power. That white people who disavow racism still live longer, get paid better, get arrested less often, and are typically in position to negotiate with whomever\u0026rsquo;s in power. That this society was built for The Everyman, and being The Everyman confers power upon you.\nWhen children of white moderates get older and first brush up against this definition, wherein white supremacy is not small but all-encompassing, where it can be cruel, but is at least as often indifferent, and where every white person in the country is bound up in it and privileged by it whether they want to be or not, and will never, ever experience it themselves - where it\u0026rsquo;s not about feelings but power - how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition I grew up with was simplified for 9-year-olds\u0026rdquo;?; or, \u0026ldquo;oh, maybe the definition given to me by white grown-ups was less complete than the one a Black grown-up might\u0026rsquo;ve given\u0026rdquo;? And how often do they say, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t just redefine racism?\u0026rdquo;\nRight out the gate, the white moderate is possessive not just of their whiteness but of the very definition of racism.\nIn the definition they know, racism exists only over here. And the white collaborator is a compatriot who shares their ultimate vision for the future, but has simply gone off course somewhere. And they don\u0026rsquo;t see themselves as flawed individuals with a long way still to go; they\u0026rsquo;ve already arrived! They\u0026rsquo;re the destination everyone else needs to get to! Living proof that white supremacy can be easily and painlessly opted out of. They can\u0026rsquo;t see collaborators as opponents because there is no definition of white supremacy that includes collaborators and doesn\u0026rsquo;t also include them.\nAnd this is critically important: they don\u0026rsquo;t want to start thinking of themselves as white. They don\u0026rsquo;t want the constant awareness of one\u0026rsquo;s race or how one\u0026rsquo;s race is perceived – you know, the things the rest of humanity deals with. And who would want that? I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who wants that: Nazis and klansmen want that. They\u0026rsquo;re the only ones who like thinking about whiteness every day. So, white moderates cling to the other definition, the comfortable one. They may be more or less willing to collaborate with people of color, but mostly in ways that don\u0026rsquo;t foreground their whiteness. White-as-default is one concession that can never be made, in part because it\u0026rsquo;s the one that can\u0026rsquo;t be spoken.\n   Racism must be understood as more than a set of individual beliefs and feelings, but as a tool for achieving political ends, first and foremost because claiming otherwise is both factually and morally wrong. But also, without this understanding, white culture can\u0026rsquo;t recognize the stakes.\n   The fascist goal is to harness and redirect class resentment towards a scapegoat.\n   They don\u0026rsquo;t care about ideas. They care about power.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2022. “The Cost of Doing Business.” Tumblr.

The B-tree generalizes the Binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. Unlike other Self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\n   ((Programiz n.d.))\n Each internal node of a B-tree contains a number of keys. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) [(e.g. \\(30\\) and \\(33\\) in the image above)]. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than \\(a_1\\), all values in the middle subtree will be between \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than \\(a_2\\).\n(“B-Tree” 2022)\n Properties For a given B-tree of order \\(m\\):\n Each Vertex has at most \\(m\\) children The root has at least two children unless it\u0026rsquo;s a leaf Internal (non-leaf) Vertices store:  Pointers to child Vertices Keys which indicate the bounds of the elements in the leaves below.   Internal Vertices have between \\(\\lceil m/2 \\rceil\\) and \\(m\\) children Internal Vertices with \\(k\\) children have \\(k - 1\\) keys Leaf Vertices store data Leaf Vertices are all on the same level  Operations Lookup  Lookup in a B-tree is straightforward. Given a node to start from, we use a simple linear or binary search to find whether the desired element is in the node, or if not, which child pointer to follow from the current node.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n Time complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nInsertion  Insertion and deletion from a B-tree are more complicated; in fact, they are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. For insertion, we first find the appropriate leaf node into which the inserted element falls (assuming it is not already in the tree). If there is already room in the node, the new element can be inserted simply. Otherwise the current leaf is already full and must be split into two leaves, one of which acquires the new element. The parent is then updated to contain a new key and child pointer. If the parent is already full, the process ripples upwards, eventually possibly reaching the root. If the root is split into two, then a new root is created with just two children, increasing the height of the tree by one.\nFor example, here is the effect of a series of insertions. The first insertion (13) merely affects a leaf. The second insertion (14) overflows the leaf and adds a key to an internal node. The third insertion propagates all the way to the root.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n       ((“B-Trees” n.d.))\n  ((“Insertion into a B-tree” n.d.))\nTime complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\nDeletion  Deletion works in the opposite way: the element is removed from the leaf. If the leaf becomes empty, a key is removed from the parent node. If that breaks invariant 3, the keys of the parent node and its immediate right (or left) sibling are reapportioned among them so that invariant 3 is satisfied. If this is not possible, the parent node can be combined with that sibling, removing a key another level up in the tree and possible causing a ripple all the way to the root. If the root has just two children, and they are combined, then the root is deleted and the new combined node becomes the root of the tree, reducing the height of the tree by one.\n(“B-Trees” n.d.)\n Time complexity Worst case: \\(\\bigo{\\log n}\\)\n","permalink":"http://cashpw.com/posts/170cf2cd-adb9-4a26-8793-1b31b2ef40c2/","summary":"In computer science, a B-tree is a self-balancing Tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

The purpose of the media spin is to provide a narrative for liberals to latch on to which explains why the United States is doing bad things, engaging with bad people, etc.\nNotes  Adam: Right. So every three, four years, five years, the President of the United States, going back to since before I was born, they visit Saudi Arabia and they codify a long existing geopolitical relationship in the Middle East. Namely, a few things which we\u0026rsquo;ll go over, which is the US support of Saudi\u0026rsquo;s bombing in Yemen, which is seen as a quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;counter measure\u0026rdquo; against quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;expansionist\u0026rdquo; Iran. That\u0026rsquo;s how they view it. They support, everyone reduces this to oil, and oil is a part of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s much more than that.\n   Adam: In the 17th and 18th century, whenever a royal needed to get a divorce because they hated their wife or they wanted a younger wife or the wife more likely couldn\u0026rsquo;t breed them a male heir, they would have some council of priests come up with, almost always say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re cousins, this is a violation of a taboo against marriage because they\u0026rsquo;re all cousins,\u0026rsquo; right? So this is sort of similar to that where there\u0026rsquo;s this clergy class of reporters who needed to explain why the fist bump was not bad but because, my favorite was Peter Baker — who is the biggest fucking hack in the world — who\u0026rsquo;s a foreign policy for The New York Times wrote, quote, \u0026ldquo;As soon as Biden got out of the car and saw MBS waiting, he immediately put his fist out making clear it would not be a handshake.\u0026rdquo; This is followed by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard who said, quote, \u0026ldquo;A chilly fist bump with M.B.S. welcomes Biden.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Right.\nNima: \u0026ldquo;Chilly,\u0026rdquo; see Adam.\nAdam: A \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nNima: They\u0026rsquo;re not friends, it was a \u0026ldquo;chilly\u0026rdquo; fist bump.\nAdam: Right. And so then you get into this whole thing where everyone\u0026rsquo;s debating whether or not this, you know, about the fist bump, the optics, you know, cozying up to dictators, human rights, that\u0026rsquo;s all bullshit.\nNima: As if the decades long relationship, which is clear as fucking day, is not the actual story here.\nAdam: Right and so the fist bump becomes a distraction in a sense, right? It becomes a way of, then the crime is not the selling of the $650 million in arms.\nNima: Right. Then we\u0026rsquo;re just reading fucking tea leaves instead of talking about the real issue.\nAdam: Right. And so the big crime really should be the month-long Washington Post investigation, that came out on June 4 of this year, detailing how despite the fact that Biden claimed he was going to end the war in Yemen to much fanfare when he first came in office — obviously, on this show, we said that\u0026rsquo;s probably bullshit, turns out total bullshit — the US has been continuing to support the Saudi bombing of Yemen to this day since Biden\u0026rsquo;s office. So the crime is not that we\u0026rsquo;re supporting their war on Yemen or supporting the blockade of Yemen, although we sort of speak in platitudes about ceasefires and lifting blockades. Fundamentally, they\u0026rsquo;re still giving intelligence support, replacing parts, et cetera. Literally pointing to a map saying this is where you want to, you know, this is where the Houthi rebels are or whatever. The US obviously sells them hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons. None of that\u0026rsquo;s changed. Then there\u0026rsquo;s this whole narrative that, \u0026lsquo;Oh, he had to do it because of Ukraine.\u0026rsquo; There was a Bloomberg headline that read, \u0026ldquo;Soaring Oil Prices Forced Biden to Engage with Saudis He\u0026rsquo;d Spurned.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Again, remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not that Biden fundamentally as President of the United States is fine with the relationship with Saudi Arabia because it\u0026rsquo;s an absolutely critical relationship to what US foreign policy is and has been for decades. Biden does not have a problem with this. He is not hand wringing about this. He is not concerned with meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. This is not an issue and yet our media needs it to be this twisted, tough decision to make.\nAdam: So from June 3, 2020, \u0026ldquo;Biden forced into Saudi thaw amid rising oil prices.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Meeting with Crown Prince would cement U-turn for a US president who labeled kingdom a \u0026lsquo;pariah.'\u0026rdquo; Financial Times — not a U turn at all. Fundamentally, policy never changed.\nNima: Right. Labeling a pariah but doing nothing to create pariah status is not actually making a pariah.\n   Adam: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;The president\u0026rsquo;s Middle East reset raises human rights concerns for some fellow Democrats. Others are prepared to get pragmatic.\u0026rdquo; So —\nNima: Oh, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s a really good one.\nAdam: Pragmatic.\nNima: Human rights concerns: niche issue. Pragmatism: reality.\n   Adam: So every single time we do this we get the same hand wringing concerns and part of me is just kind of frustrated by this because I\u0026rsquo;m like, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this theater? What\u0026rsquo;s the point at this point, in the year of our Lord, Ken Roth has been the head of Human Rights Watch for going on, you know, 35 years or going on 30 years now, right? You\u0026rsquo;d think after Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, Biden all did the exact same trip, they greenlit the exact same weapons deals, they have soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia who then left but then sort of came back. You have the US selling every single Gulf despot from Kuwait to UAE to Saudi Arabia the same spy technology so they can spy on dissidents and lock them up. You have these very cozy business relationships between Saudi Arabia funds Vice media, UAE funds CNN, you would think after these decades of relationships that this is not something that deviates from quote-unquote \u0026ldquo;abandoning principles,\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s actually the principle itself and that once you shred that pretense, again, what replaces it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, might makes right nihilism or kind of Kissinger view of the world about power1, it should be okay, well, what would a government that actually cares about human rights both negative and positive, right? Not just freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, but freedom from poverty, freedom for education, freedom for housing.\nAdam: Right. What would that regime look like and is that something we could maybe pressure our government to do or fight for? The sort of classic critique of this arrangement is that allied states, the United States and allied states, are viewed as being, when they commit human rights violations, it\u0026rsquo;s seen as a deviation whereas when human rights are committed by enemy states, they\u0026rsquo;re existential to who they are.\nNima: Right. Fundamental to what those states are all about. They only understand power, they don\u0026rsquo;t care about their people, that\u0026rsquo;s all the stuff that we\u0026rsquo;ve that about on the show like about what these kinds of countries elsewhere deemed to be official US state enemies. They are fundamentally bad and we are fundamentally good.\nAdam: Right and we just deviate. Yeah, we need a mild talking to, we need a mild chiding. And so a very infamous version of this was in January of 2015 when King Abdullah died, this is again this sort of worst of the worst human rights violators, this is before the war in Yemen started but we\u0026rsquo;re talking, you know, women can\u0026rsquo;t drive, chopping up dissenters, mass beheadings, oppressive Shia religious intolerance, blah, blah, blah, you name it, they got it, a lot of connections to al Qaeda, which we\u0026rsquo;ll table for another episode. Yeah, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Saudi Arabia: King\u0026rsquo;s Reform Agenda Unfulfilled,\u0026rdquo; and the article said, quote:\nKing Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s reign brought about marginal advances for women but failed to secure the fundamental rights of Saudi citizens to free expression, association, and assembly. Abdullah\u0026rsquo;s successor, King Salman, should halt persecution of peaceful dissidents and religious minorities…\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s like, okay, his reform agenda was unfulfilled, right? And contrast this with Hugo Chavez who died about 21 months prior, Human Rights Watch\u0026rsquo;s headline was, \u0026ldquo;Venezuela: Chavez\u0026rsquo;s Authoritarian Legacy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Dramatic Concentration of Power and Open Disregard for Basic Human Rights.\u0026rdquo; Throughout the obituary of Chavez he\u0026rsquo;s seen as existential to the regime as human rights abuses whereas Saudi Arabia remains, even though of course, they commit hundreds and hundreds of more human rights abuses than Chavez ever did, Saudi Arabia is seen as having a reform, unironically, said to have a reform agenda, which was simply unfulfilled.\nNima: Reform agenda. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t get to be completed, because the noble reformist died. Oops.\nAdam: Yeah, their dog ate the reform agenda so they had to sort of write it again, it was a whole thing. I mean, this whole thing is so, you realize again, just after years and years and years of this kind of discourse how empty it is, how much it\u0026rsquo;s meant to sort of limit the conversation.\n[links and footnotes added]\n   Adam: Would any New York Times reporter without irony say that scholars of the Middle East claim that it\u0026rsquo;s best that Russia align with Iran and Syria? Because that\u0026rsquo;ll promote good behavior, dissuade, no, you would be laughed out of the room if you said that. But this goofy, childish bullshit that has absolutely no empirical basis, is based on a bunch of racist assumptions, that somehow the US is the human rights Boys and Girls Club, is going to be your mentor, it\u0026rsquo;s going to look after you, it\u0026rsquo;s just going to look after these otherwise kind of restless young countries, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to, we\u0026rsquo;re going to guide them to the right path? What the fuck is that? After school special? Saudi Arabia knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, we know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, they\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the same thing for decades, they serve a very specific function, and this idea that we\u0026rsquo;re going to change them from the inside. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the height of cynicism and Ben Hubbard is just a total fucking White House flunky, he\u0026rsquo;s a total national security state flunky, is going to just kind of seeing how many the sophistic little ratchet pellets he can shove in his article to so liberals can go, \u0026lsquo;Yeah, well, I guess he\u0026rsquo;s right, I guess we have no choice.\u0026rsquo; So all that hemming and hawing and huffing and puffing over Trump patting dictators on the back and going to Saudi Arabia and doing this, it\u0026rsquo;s like, \u0026lsquo;I guess that this is somehow different than that.\u0026rsquo; Well, no, it\u0026rsquo;s not different. Oh, because he did it with a heavy fucking heart.\nNima: Well, because see, this goes back to that sophistry, right? This goes back to the fucking sophistry, Adam, which is Trump did it because he fundamentally agreed with them and he wanted to be like them and he was impressed by dictators, right? But Biden, Biden does it because he just, ah, it\u0026rsquo;s such a bummer, he\u0026rsquo;s so forced, he\u0026rsquo;s going to, he\u0026rsquo;s going to be forced to give a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump\u0026rdquo; as opposed to —\nAdam: Oh, a \u0026ldquo;chilly fist bump.\u0026rdquo;\nNima: Right. Here\u0026rsquo;s a chilly fist bump along with your $650 million worth of weapons.\n   Nima: [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Cut Biden some slack. U.S. presidents have to deal with dictators.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the headline, and in it, Max Boot argues, of course, what you would think which is, you know, hey, this is the way Realpolitik is executed, why is everyone getting so up in arms about this? In the article he writes this, quote:\n\u0026ldquo;In truth, MBS is a more ambivalent figure than the cartoon villain that he is so often made out to be in media coverage. It\u0026rsquo;s true that he is cruel and repressive. He has created a climate of fear in Saudi Arabia, imprisoned dissidents and accumulated absolute power. But, while illiberal politically, he is liberalizing Saudi society.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Yeah, which he\u0026rsquo;s not, whatever, he\u0026rsquo;s been doing the same reform agenda for, you know, the 250 year Saudi Foreign reform agenda.\nNima: The long game.\nAdam: It\u0026rsquo;ll be ready when my great-great grandson.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. \u0026ldquo;Tourists are welcome for the first time,\u0026rdquo; he writes. \u0026ldquo;Theaters and concerts have been opened.\u0026rdquo;\nAdam: Oh, theaters and concerts. Okay.\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right.\nAdam: Yeah. Lord knows that that\u0026rsquo;s the mark of a liberal democracy is bread and circuses that historically —\nNima: That\u0026rsquo;s right. And meanwhile, The Washington Post is publishing this and Jamal Khashoggi, again, who was bone sawed alive by the MBS regime, by, you know, guys carrying this fucking shit out, that is the same outlet that is publishing this shit for Max Boot justifying it.\nAdam: Max Boot argues on Twitter that Nixon met with Mao Zedong, FDR met with Stalin blah, blah, blah, and it\u0026rsquo;s like, look, it\u0026rsquo;s true, I actually think that all the anger about the fist bump is a distraction. It\u0026rsquo;s not really the problem.\nNima: Right. The meeting is not the issue. That could be diplomacy. He\u0026rsquo;s not meeting MBS for diplomatic reasons.\nAdam: Right. He\u0026rsquo;s meeting with him to talk about increasing the weapons sales that we, the substance of the relationship is the problem, which is supporting and backing the subjugation of dissidents, the bombing of Yemeni, the oppression of women, I mean, you name it, right? The support for sectarianism in the region, blah, blah, blah, which again, I think has geopolitical function for US and Israel. It\u0026rsquo;s not the actual fist bump.\nNima: The lie is that Biden is meeting with an enemy.

How might you introduce that to someone who\u0026rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, I would say essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization \u0026ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible \u0026ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what\u0026rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.\nI should also say it really pushes back on the image and stereotype of a sort of bleak drab, sort of breadline poverty that many people associate with the term communism and tries to reinvent that term, from a position of abundance. So fully automated luxury. Communism really emphasizes communism instead of capitalism to because capitalism has these internal mechanisms that prevent it from generating abundance, it really relies on scarcity. Moreover, in a world where human labor is largely valueless in the production process \u0026ndash; that is a world where robots can do it so much better \u0026ndash; wages no longer makes sense. So you just gain either an income or some version of access to material benefits without necessarily putting in working hours.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning and we can talk maybe more about this later, there\u0026rsquo;s actually a manifesto style book that explains the concept by Aaron Bastani, entitled [Aaron Bastani | Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto], published by verso in 2019. But those are the broad strokes of the term, I\u0026rsquo;d say.\n[formatting added]\n   [Della Z Duncan]\n[\u0026hellip;] Eric, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering what about you like you describe this sense of being in a grocery store and machine kind of delivering the goods on the on the shelves? What else might we see or feel in under fully automated luxury communism?\n[Eric Wycoff Rogers]\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a great question. And I think like Mark Fisher, I also start with the questions of urbanism.\nI think urbanism is really important, it\u0026rsquo;s important to imagine our built environment operating under a different logic. So when I try to imagine a fully automated luxury communist world, the key thing I ponder is how our relationship to space and time would change. And something I really want to know is what cities would be like, again, if they were not oriented around work and consumerism. I mean, think about like how much of the street level experience is dominated by those things, and what it could be like if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThis is something that a friend of mine and collaborator, [unclear] Bria and I were working on and a project we were we had going last year called Imagining the Postwork City, where we invited artists and designers to submit visions of what postwork cities and an automated society could look like. And these are some of the prompts, which I think start to really answer the question.\nSo in terms of public space, you know what kinds of public spaces might exist in place of offices and factories and stores that currently dominate the landscapes of our downtown\u0026rsquo;s and central districts? What facilities and attractions might exist to occupy the time that\u0026rsquo;s freed from work? How might people interact with the forms and functions of the city and determine its uses? In terms of housing? What kinds of dwellings would people have in such a world? Would people even continue to have homes and the traditional sort of fixed sense? Or might they just drift, either from fixed place to fixed place, or else become part of a sort of urban hunter gatherer society, just eating, sleeping, playing wherever you happen to be at the time entirely in public spaces, never really claiming these as your own? Or perhaps we would always be on vacation and just follow some around the world? Who knows? This also leads into questions about the sort of regional distribution of the population would you know, if you\u0026rsquo;re not, if you\u0026rsquo;re no longer working, then you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be somewhere based on economic opportunity, that being the key driver of both migration and settlement patterns throughout history. So who knows? Maybe everyone would live in tropical regions, or maybe people who live in the types of regions that make them happy.\nThis begs questions of whether certain regions would perhaps depopulate and others would grow because they\u0026rsquo;re just more conducive to human happiness. Would existing cities dissipate as people became free of the economic tethers that keep them there? Would everyone become rural? I like to think we would continue to value cities but for new and better reasons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s infrastructural questions, what kinds of transit might we have, how we get around? How would goods be distributed? I mean, this vision of the grocery store that\u0026rsquo;s just sort of roboticized? Isn\u0026rsquo;t an interesting one. Would it continue to be a grocery store? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if you\u0026rsquo;d need walls around it anymore because there\u0026rsquo;s no point in stealing in a world where all the things are available to you.\nLots of questions too to ask about how we spend our time. And there\u0026rsquo;s no more sort of distinct breakdown between like leisure time and work time, you\u0026rsquo;re kind of always being creative. You know, you\u0026rsquo;d have new kinds of divisions between space and maybe have spaces specifically for rest and other spaces specifically for healing or for thinking or for feeling good, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it becomes a really exciting design problem, really.\nAnd it was fun to see what these artists and designers came up with in response to these prompts. There were lots of visions of green spaces, multi layered urbanism, drawing inspiration from resorts, you know, seeing resorts, and currently like luxury and exclusive spaces almost as like prefigurative little aspects of what the whole world can be like.\n[formatting added]\n   [Zarinah Agnew]\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s one other thing I want to mention, which is, I think important, because I think when people think of communism, they think a lot of austerity and bleak equality, where everyone has access to the same things, but the things that they have access to a kind of rubbish. And I wanted to mention something from David Graeber, his most recent book, in which they reference indigenous and native forms of economics. And they talk about, you know, in these early forms of economic societies, people still had private ownership, they could have trinkets and objects and symbols, things that they use to denote the individualism, things that they gifted to others to sort of, say, thank you, and so on, and so forth. But crucially, the things that were privately owned, could not be turned into power over others. And the resources that were fundamental for collective survival, like land couldn\u0026rsquo;t be privately owned. And so I think what luxury communism points to is both the ability to make sure that everybody\u0026rsquo;s needs are met, and we have a good life. And also the sort of luxury and quality of being able to have our own aesthetic and our own ways of being and adorning our lives, I think is really important.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Upstream. 2022. “Fully Automated Luxury Communism.” https://soundcloud.com/upstreampodcast/fully-automated-luxury-communism.

","title":"Hash function"},{"content":" In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map or dictionary, is a Data structure that implements a [Associative array], a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a Hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.\nIdeally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n Collision resolution  A search algorithm that uses hashing consists of two parts. The first part is computing a hash function which transforms the search key into an array index. The ideal case is such that no two search keys hashes to the same array index. However, this is not always the case and is impossible to guarantee for unseen given data. Hence the second part of the algorithm is collision resolution. The two common methods for collision resolution are Separate chaining and Open addressing.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n Separate chaining  [\u0026hellip;] the process involves building a linked list with key–value pair for each search array index. The collided items are chained together through a single linked list, which can be traversed to access the item with a unique search key.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n   Open addressing  [\u0026hellip;] is another collision resolution technique in which every entry records are stored in the bucket array itself, and the hash resolution is performed through probing. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates an unsuccessful search.\n(“Hash Table” 2022)\n    Well-known probe sequences include:\n Linear probing, in which the interval between probes is fixed (usually 1). Quadratic probing, in which the interval between probes is increased by adding the successive outputs of a quadratic polynomial to the value given by the original hash computation. Double hashing, in which the interval between probes is computed by a secondary hash function.

The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMain proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion (\u0026ldquo;disorganized distress\u0026rdquo;), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.\n(“Attachment Theory” 2022)\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Attachment Theory.” 2022.

Because the easier it is to do a thing, the more it happens.\nThe mentality here is that, if you can\u0026rsquo;t stop every shooting, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother stopping any; if you can\u0026rsquo;t save every life, there\u0026rsquo;s no point improving healthcare. Nothing short of literally defeating death will be good enough.\nIt is a wholesale rejection of thinking in terms of systems. Notice how Payroll phrases his argument: \u0026ldquo;A bad person can always find a way to do bad things.\u0026rdquo; Person. Singular. If a criminal can still get a gun, they extrapolate that every criminal can get a gun, in the same way that, if a poor person can get a job, every poor person can get a job. Which, no. If there are fewer jobs than people who need them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be unemployment, and if there are fewer guns than people who want to shoot them, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be less gun crime. If they talked about populations of people they\u0026rsquo;d have to acknowledge that some percentage succeeds at doing bad things and a percentage fails, and, since percentages are different across cultures, we must have some influence over them. But a binaristic model of \u0026ldquo;things either happen or they don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; leaves no room for percentages. Was there a shooting? Then there is still evil in the world.\nA conservative will generally agree with you about what the ills of society are: bigotry, violence, disease, oppression, poverty. But they don\u0026rsquo;t view them as problems to be solved. They are facts of life. Of course racism is terrible… but it\u0026rsquo;s a Monday. Trying to fight racism is like trying to fight the first law of motion. The only reason to even talk about it is to commiserate.\n   And, on its face, this seems completely contradictory to all the other things they claim to believe. Sometimes you wanna scream at Payroll, \u0026ldquo;How can you think regulating guns won\u0026rsquo;t reduce shootings but somehow regulating women will reduce abortions?!\u0026rdquo; But here\u0026rsquo;s the real kicker: he doesn\u0026rsquo;t. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t think illegalizing abortions will make them happen less. What he wants is to throw people in jail for getting them. It\u0026rsquo;s right there in how he talks about gun rights: \u0026ldquo;Why should I be punished for the crimes of a monster?\u0026rdquo; To him, the law isn\u0026rsquo;t about shaping society, it\u0026rsquo;s about who gets punished [He\u0026rsquo;s not hurting the people he needs to be].\n   In this view, human nature is immutable. People are going to… be gay and do crime, and get abortions, and take drugs, and the law is not there to guide, it is there to judge. It is there it sanctify one particular walk of life as The Right Way. The reason they\u0026rsquo;re opposed to contraceptives and sex ed is not because they don\u0026rsquo;t work, but because they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter that kids who get abstinence-only education have just as much sex than the ones who learn about condoms; acknowledging that teenagers have sex is saying it\u0026rsquo;s ok, and abstinence says it\u0026rsquo;s not. And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, it\u0026rsquo;s because you\u0026rsquo;re just not trying hard enough! More abstinence! More abstinence!\n   Take, for example, the (often liberal) sentiment, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils.\u0026rdquo; There is no consequentialist argument for this. Perhaps if you and an organized bloc of citizens threatened to withhold your votes in order to influence policy, but, as a purely individual act, the consequentialist would argue your goal is to achieve the most ethical outcome. And that, if there are two evils, and one or the other is going to be in a position of power, voting for the lesser is more ethical than staying home. The consequentialist would argue you are just as responsible for the results of your inaction as for the actions you take. When both options are terrible, all you can do is mitigate the damage.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not generally the way it feels. It feels like refusing to participate, or choosing someone you want to win but whom you know isn\u0026rsquo;t going to, is the more ethical option. That voting for the lesser is a moral compromise. This feeling is independent of results. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mitigate damage, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce harm, but it does preserve your integrity [Ian Danskin | You Go High, We Go Low]. That feeling is very powerful; many politicians have staked their careers on it. Our society has always told us that voting for any flavor of evil will leave a stain on our souls; it continues to feel this way even among people who no longer believe in souls. The greatest difference between Left and Right is simply in how common and how intense this feeling is.\n   The necessary counternarrative is to stress that the problems we face are not natural features of the world, that, in fact, very little of human life is natural, and, even if it were, what is natural is not necessarily what is right. The way nature deals with a pandemic is to let everyone without a genetic resistance to the illness die, and, if what\u0026rsquo;s left is not a stable breeding population, you go extinct. That\u0026rsquo;s natural. Humanity as we know it only exists in defiance nature. Every form of bigotry, every means of oppression, is a thing we created; they are human problems, and they have human solutions. They have not always existed and there are places in the world where they are being addressed. The idea that the worst things on Earth have no great significance, that most evil is a chaotic mess borne of human fallibility, can be very depressing to consider; it can also be empowering.\nThis is a secular view. It can be reconciled with spirituality, but not with reactionary fundamentalism, which is the point. And it can be kind of baffling to have to assert that, when bad things happen, maybe we should do something about it? But you just can\u0026rsquo;t take for granted that, when someone agrees a thing is bad, they\u0026rsquo;re agreeing it\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2020. “I Hate Mondays.” Tumblr.

And you conclude that, if you believe in democracy, you must believe in equality, and, if you believe in equality, you must believe in equal access to education, and must conclude that governments should help pay tuition. And so you give your friend the benefit of the doubt that, if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand this very simple logical progression, he either hasn\u0026rsquo;t had it properly explained to him, or has, at some point, been lied to. Because no one could believe in \u0026ldquo;all citizens are equal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;always a bigger fish\u0026rdquo; at the same time.\nBut, by this thinking, you\u0026rsquo;re treating most conservatives as people who want, in their hearts, to be liberals, but have so far failed. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why they think liberals are condescending?\n   [\u0026hellip;] when a choice between [capitalism and democracy] has to be made, a liberal is someone who tends to think democratically, and a conservative is someone who tends to think like a capitalist.\nTHE OPERATIVE WORD HERE IS \u0026ldquo;TEND.\u0026rdquo; Liberals are still capitalists and conservatives still stan for democracy, and the preference for one or the other may be very slight. Nevertheless, which way a person leans reveals their priorities.\n   The democratic framework - or, at least, a democratic framework - is \u0026ldquo;one citizen, one vote.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are, you are born with certain in- or possibly unalienable rights, and any system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you those rights is a tyranny. Freedom, agency, and a hand in the strictures that govern you; everyone is entitled to these things. It\u0026rsquo;s an egalitarian mindset; people gain power by electoral process, i.e. when it is granted to them by the masses, with whom the true power resides, and whom the Constitution guarantees the right to take that power away from an electee. Rather than powerful, the elected official is, in a sense, an employee with millions of bosses, all of whom have equal authority. This is the idea of democracy, with the history of democracy being riddled with failures to live up to this ideal, but part of the project of liberalism has been about making the government more closely resemble its ideology.\n   The capitalist framework, by contrast, is that of businesses and markets, where \u0026ldquo;big fish eat the little ones.\u0026rdquo; If two people start businesses in the same field, and one makes more profit than the other, that person can make more investments, open more locations, undercut their competitor\u0026rsquo;s prices. The more money you have, the more money you can make. So advantage compounds, where even small failures often mean getting muscled out of the field. Now, with some creativity - a novel cost-saving practice or a new delivery method - the underdog can still thrive, and this is part of what conservatives like about the market: that it demands this creativity in a live-ammo environment. But most will not beat the odds; that\u0026rsquo;s how odds work. Since there will always be more failures than successes, the general trajectory of unregulated capitalism is money pooling into fewer and fewer hands. Things naturally sort themselves into a hierarchy with sharks at top, a million minnows at the bottom.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn conservative thinking, this hierarchy is humanity\u0026rsquo;s natural state. The American Dream is \u0026ldquo;here, anyone can make it.\u0026rdquo; No matter who you are or what you start with, you can become a billionaire. But a necessary component of this is: anyone can, but everyone can\u0026rsquo;t. We\u0026rsquo;re not all gonna be billionaires, there\u0026rsquo;s a finite amount of money in this country. For any one person to have so, so, so much more than they need, there must - mathematically - be thousands of people with less. Your conservative friend is often baffled as to what you\u0026rsquo;re even trying to say when you point out there\u0026rsquo;s not enough high-paying jobs or affordable health plans for everyone; there\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be. The system requires an underclass. Someone\u0026rsquo;s gotta clean the toilets.\nCapitalism, then, is a proving ground. It\u0026rsquo;s how you demonstrate where in the hierarchy you deserve to be. Do you have more than you need, or less? Anything you\u0026rsquo;ve got, you beat someone else to it. How resourceful were you? How well did you play? The field is, by no means, level, but any disadvantage just means you have to work harder. We know people who start with nothing can win big; if you are a shark, you will make your way to the top, because that\u0026rsquo;s where you belong. Anyone complaining about how stacked the deck is against them is making excuses for not being better at the game.\nDisadvantage itself is not a problem, so long as it is (quote-unquote) \u0026ldquo;natural.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s necessary is that advantage and disadvantage not be imposed from without. Free tuition, a high minimum wage, taxes on the wealthy, or any other kind of government meddling, these things must be opposed, because, with them, people would end up in the wrong places. Power has to be earned; if it isn\u0026rsquo;t earned, it won\u0026rsquo;t be properly wielded, and then society ends up a mess. Conservatives generally feel what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the world today can be chalked up to people not being where they should be in the social order. They used to be where they belonged, but then liberals gummed everything up with their government handouts and forced representation. (When, exactly, things were the way they should be is a bit of a moving target: nowadays, they act like it was the 80\u0026rsquo;s, in the 80\u0026rsquo;s it was the 50\u0026rsquo;s, and in the 50\u0026rsquo;s it was some time before the New Deal. So, following the nostalgia cycle, it\u0026rsquo;s usually \u0026ldquo;about thirty years ago.\u0026quot;)\nConservatives are distrustful of any effort to make society more equal because, deep down, they don\u0026rsquo;t believe equal societies are real. Obviously, \u0026ldquo;all citizens created equal\u0026rdquo; needs to be the government\u0026rsquo;s position, because you can\u0026rsquo;t trust the government to know where to put people, so it has to treat everyone the same. But this is a legal fiction, like corporate personhood. It just means \u0026ldquo;the government leaves the market alone so the hierarchy can reveal itself.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to believe in an equal distribution of power. What are you, seven? This is just the way the world is. Look at alpha wolves, silverbacks; consider the lobster.\nYou are one, single individual within a system, and it is your job to rise or fall within it on the sweat of your own back. You don\u0026rsquo;t change the system. Society\u0026rsquo;s problems come from the rules being too weakly enforced. The answer is always more discipline. Your conservative friend thinks you\u0026rsquo;re naive for thinking the system even can be changed, and his is the charitable interpretation! Many conservatives assume liberals - at least, the smart liberals - know that the hierarchy is eternal, that there will always be people at the top and people at the bottom, so any claim towards making things equal must be a Trojan horse for something that benefits them [Realpolitik]. (Why would they assume that? Because that\u0026rsquo;s what they do.) The real liberal agenda is to put people in the wrong places on purpose. Boost liberal allies, hold back liberal opposition. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to break up the pyramid, you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to sneak someone else to the top.\n   A lot of conservative contradictions start to make sense through this lens. Of any issue, simply ask: does this distribute power, or consolidate it? If power flows up the hierarchy, they\u0026rsquo;re for it, if it flows down, they\u0026rsquo;re against it.\n   The thing about hierarchies is that they\u0026rsquo;re self-similar on many scales. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle, then you serve the king. Valar dohaeris [Valar dohaeris]. But, to everyone beneath you, you are the king. You\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job and a good wage, that gives you some power over people who don\u0026rsquo;t. And getting pissed at those above implies that those below have a right to be pissed at you. There\u0026rsquo;s a real anxiety that liberals want to make room for those people in the middle by putting conservatives at the bottom, and that those people will then treat conservatives the way conservatives treated them. Freedom, respect, and empathy are looked on as finite resources in a competitive marketplace just like jobs and scholarships.\n   No matter how much a conservative believes in \u0026ldquo;earning\u0026rdquo; one\u0026rsquo;s place, they have, always in the back of their mind, an image of what society should look like, and any discrepancy between imagination and observation must mean foul play. This feminist is too respected, this Black superhero is too popular, it can\u0026rsquo;t be because they\u0026rsquo;re worthy; someone must have put their hand on the scales. Someone got a freebie or played the race card or faked a scandal. This means, even though they claim the hierarchy is natural, what they will or won\u0026rsquo;t accept as legitimate is a gut feeling. If they like what they see, they take credit for it; if they don\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s the Left\u0026rsquo;s fault. And what does it say about them that they see a bunch of white, male sharks and think, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s authentic\u0026rdquo;?\n   Savvy viewers may be remembering another political philosophy that is hierarchical, undemocratic, built on nostalgia, and that likes to cloak its policies in progressive camouflage, and that\u0026rsquo;s the one from two videos ago: fascism. (ooooooohhhhhh golly) Now: I am not calling conservatives fascists. There are distinctions: Under fascism, the hierarchy is much, much less meritocratic, and the nostalgia is much, much older. However: conservative thinking is, at the very least, one that fascism maps more cleanly onto. Fascists appeal to this hierarchical mindset by portraying all of history as struggles between ethnic groups over who gets to be where. \u0026ldquo;Someone\u0026rsquo;s got to be at the bottom, white man. We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure it isn\u0026rsquo;t you.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll find, throughout history, that fascist movements, though they often pick up dissidents from all over the political spectrum (the \u0026ldquo;Third Position,\u0026rdquo; for instance, is fascism for anti-capitalists), when they find purchase in a political party, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much always the conservative party. Look at France, look at Brazil, look at here. Whether you want to interpret that as conservatives being uniquely susceptible to fascists, or diet fascism being another name for conservatism, I leave that up to you.\n   The most important thing to understand is that you cannot communicate with nor anticipate the behaviors of a conservative if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they believe. Which is hard, because they\u0026rsquo;re often in denial. You will never convince them to compromise on any attempt to break up the hierarchy, because even incremental change strikes them as revolutionary and they feel they\u0026rsquo;ve made too many concessions already. You will never get them, of their own free will, to agree to government regulation, because the government, as a democratic institution, is inherently unnatural. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like what a business is doing, you don\u0026rsquo;t regulate it, you take your money elsewhere. You should favor the capitalist solution, not the democratic one. (Also, when you vote with your dollar, people with more dollars get more votes.) They will never be onboard with aiding the poor in any systemic way, and will, instead, champion charity and crowdfunding, because minnows getting to eat should always be framed as a gift rather than a right. You may get individual conservatives to come around on some of these, but, as a body, they will never consent to any of it unless they can work it to their advantage or if you have leverage over them. They will sign on when denying progressivism costs them something, because few things terrify them more than slipping down the hierarchy [Also, Authoritarian followers place \u0026ldquo;being normal\u0026rdquo; substantially higher than most people do].\n   A good defense against fascism is to consciously, intentionally, think and act in democratic terms, because newsflash: we\u0026rsquo;re not actually lobsters. Neither of these systems is natural. They are choices we can make. I recommend this one, because egalitarian thinking is one thing Nazis are bad at infiltrating.\nIf you want to fight fascism, move left.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2019. “Always a Bigger Fish.” Tumblr.

Claiming \u0026ldquo;the Card Says Moops\u0026rdquo; does not, so much, mean, \u0026ldquo;I believe the people who invaded Spain in the 8th Century were literally called The Moops,\u0026rdquo; but, rather, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t prove I don\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\u0026rdquo; Not a statement of sincere belief, simply moving a piece across the board.

(…it also means \u0026ldquo;Jews.\u0026quot;) Postmodern conservatism is the thinking that, at least for the purpose of argument, the truth of who invaded Spain is immaterial. You have your facts, I have alternative facts. What is true? Who\u0026rsquo;s to say?\n   Sincerity is unprovable and open to interpretation. Decide someone is sincere if you want to make fun of them, decide they\u0026rsquo;re trolling if you want to make fun of someone else. What is true? What do you want to be true? It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to start thinking of one\u0026rsquo;s own opinions the same way: What do I believe? What is it advantageous to believe? Your answer isn\u0026rsquo;t binding. You\u0026rsquo;ll change it later if you need to.\n   The thing is, Bob, it\u0026rsquo;s not that they\u0026rsquo;re lying, it\u0026rsquo;s that they just don\u0026rsquo;t care. I\u0026rsquo;ll say that again for the cheap seats: When they make these kinds of arguments, they legitimately do not care whether the words coming out of their mouths are true. It is a deeply held belief for precisely as long as it wins arguments.\n   You might now conclude the internet reactionary believes in nothing except winning arguments with liberals. And, like Newtonian physics, if you assume this framing, you will get highly useful results. If you enter conversation with Engelbert and Charlemagne believing they do not mean what they say, they are only entertaining notions, and, on a long enough timeline, they will eventually defend a position fundamentally incompatible with the one they defended earlier in the same argument, you will navigate that conversation much more effectively!\nBut, like Newtonian physics, this framing is lowercase-a accurate without being capital-T True.\n[Why is it always the libs?]\nSo much of conservative rhetoric is about maintaining ignorance of one\u0026rsquo;s own beliefs. To uphold the institution of imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy while thinking you are none of those things. (Well, OK, knowing you\u0026rsquo;re a capitalist, but thinking it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.) Most people have a baseline of fairly conventional, kindergarten morality, and conservatism often clashes with it. You can rationalize these contradictions - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a bigot, I just believe in states' rights\u0026rdquo; - but, as American conservatism gets more radical, it gets harder to square one\u0026rsquo;s politics with what one assumes to be one\u0026rsquo;s beliefs. So you learn, when someone challenges you, to cycle through beliefs until something sticks, just play your hand and trust that you\u0026rsquo;re right, or, in extreme cases, insist you have no beliefs at all, you\u0026rsquo;re just here to watch the world burn.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re not. They are willing participants in the burning of only certain parts. They don\u0026rsquo;t care what they believe, but they know what they hate, and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about why they hate it. On paper, they believe in freedom of religion and freedom of expression, but they also hang out in communities where Muslims and trans women are punching bags. And, like a sixth grader who believes one thing in Sunday school and another thing in biology class, they believe different things at different times.\n   If you operate as though there is no truth, just competing opinions, and as though opinions aren\u0026rsquo;t sincere, just tools to be picked up and dropped depending on their utility, then what are you operating under? Self-interest. The desire to win. You\u0026rsquo;ll defend the Holocaust just to feel smarter than someone, superior. Think about how beautifully that maps onto the in-group/out-group mentality of dominance and bigotry. Think how incompatible it is with liberal ideas of tolerance. I think this is why we don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of these \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just here to fuck shit up\u0026rdquo; types on the Left. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the Left has gotten on some bullshit, but (excepting politicians, whom you should never assume to mean anything they say) it\u0026rsquo;s sincerely-believed bullshit! We don\u0026rsquo;t build identities around saying things just to piss people off.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2019. “The Card Says Moops.” Tumblr.

But in response the Republicans… seize the Supreme Court.\n   When one party can be relied on to do the exact opposite of your worst behavior, good strategy is to do to them, as destructively as possible, whatever you don\u0026rsquo;t want them to do to you.\n   [\u0026hellip;] building a coalition on the Left is a lot of work, and, faced with this challenge, there is a liberal tendency to turn away from policy and focus instead on process; generally uncontroversial things like bipartisanship, compromise, decorum. And, fair enough, the absence of these things in Washington over the years is certainly something everyone Left-of-Center is sick of, but they\u0026rsquo;re not things Democrats can make happen all by themselves, and, more to the point, none of them are results. They\u0026rsquo;re means.\nLike, a willingness to compromise is not a position. And when you overfocus on how you should go about things and not what things you should go about, it fosters a certain philosophy about government that is both highly flawed and highly exploitable: The valuing of means at the expense of ends.\nMost people would say that \u0026ldquo;the ends justify the means\u0026rdquo; is a crap moral philosophy. Democrats would agree. But liberals often overcorrect to the point where thinking about the ends at all is thought of as - in a vague, reflexive kind of way - innately immoral. There\u0026rsquo;s a very Enlightenment way of thinking that implies that, with the right means, the ends take care of themselves, and immoral behavior becomes functionally impossible.\n   [\u0026hellip;] Democrats keep doing it, because on some level they genuinely believe that, even when it accomplishes nothing, following the rules to the bitter end is the noble thing to do. The captain goes down with the ship.\n   And I\u0026rsquo;ll say one thing for Republicans: They believe in something. It\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of classist, racist, misogynist doolally, but they believe it, and they govern according to those beliefs. There is no contradiction in blocking a liberal Judge and bullying Democrats to confirm a conservative one: They want to overturn the right to abortion, and will do whatever it takes to put a pro-lifer on the bench. It\u0026rsquo;s fully consistent behavior. And the problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that they break a bunch of rules along the way, it\u0026rsquo;s that what they\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish is wrong.\nBut Democrats focus on the rule-breaking and not the intent behind it because, despite what Republicans will tell you, many Democrats are terrified of talking about abortion, for fear that taking a stand on a wedge issue will lose them their coalition. Believing in a politics where everyone can disagree on everything and democracy sorts it out is wishful thinking born of necessity.\n   What would be the effective ways to combat the Alt-Right? Kick them off social media, shut down their websites, cut off their funding, police their organizations as hate groups, and, if all else fails, be willing to deck someone at a counter-protest if it will prevent greater violence. So what do they do to us? Falsely report our tweets as hatespeech, DDoS our websites, try to shut down our Patreons, report us to the police as terrorists, and beat and murder people in the streets. Now, these are all things they enjoy doing regardless, but they serve a strategic purpose. If we consider doing to them anything like to what they\u0026rsquo;ve done to us, we get the performative self-flagellation: \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to stoop to our level, now would you?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd when they tell us it would be wrong to kick them off Twitter or stop them from organizing even though they keep killing people, what argument do they give us? They invoke the First Amendment. They defend not their actions but the process. They don\u0026rsquo;t believe in universal free speech or the right to assemble, but they know we do.\n   An action has no intrinsic value wholly separate from its outcome. A Kentucky clerk breaking the law by refusing to sign a legal gay marriage license is wrong. And a California clerk breaking the law by signing an illegal gay marriage license is right.

Historically, the first sign that things are about to get a lot worse for minorities is when the racism stops being euphemistic.\n Notes  Politicians only let a euphemism die when they don\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore.\n   Now, white racists have a complicated relationship to their own racism. They seemingly want the impossible: they want segregation without appearing to be segregationists, racist policy without the social repercussions. Possibly, they don\u0026rsquo;t even want to admit their racism to themselves. Silvermilk would need a framing that allowed the blithely racist, the overtly racist, and the non-racist to unite under a single banner.\nFor this purpose, Silvermilk landed on the long-enduring euphemism: \u0026ldquo;states' rights.\u0026rdquo; [You\u0026rsquo;re getting so abstract]\n   States' rights was invoked - and is still invoked - to defend anti-miscegenation laws, anti-abortion laws, same-sex marriage bans, trans bathroom bills, spousal rape, you name it. Every time there are gains for social minorities, the Republicans shore up the votes of bigots who find these gains offensive.\n   It\u0026rsquo;s hard for the Left to argue with the \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; argument because it\u0026rsquo;s not designed to make sense. Republicans will say we should leave an issue like same-sex marriage up to the states, but only after a Federal ban on same-sex marriage proves infeasible. Up until that moment, they are in favor of government overreach. So \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; has never been a consistent philosophy, but, then, why should it be? It\u0026rsquo;s a euphemism. Its sole purpose is bringing an extreme ideology into mainstream politics.\n   [\u0026hellip;] loyalty is one of the strongest things in politics today. Come Election Day, people who disavowed him was making phone calls on [Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s] behalf.\n   A euphemism dies when it no longer works to disguise things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said, or when culture at large decides things that can\u0026rsquo;t be said are now sayable. In the last couple videos, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about how the Far Right mainstreams a, for instance, racist idea by convincing people it\u0026rsquo;s not racist. What we\u0026rsquo;re seeing here is the endgame of that process: once the public embraces them as people, elects their politicians, and implements their policies, they begin, bit by bit, to drop the pretense. Because, if they want to close the borders once and for all, it\u0026rsquo;s in their best interest to stop pretending border control is about protecting jobs.\nA sad truth about humans is they will often accept almost any justification to keep doing whatever they\u0026rsquo;re already doing [Cognitive dissonance]. If someone has spent years favoring border security - they\u0026rsquo;ve voted for it, their taxes have paid for it, maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve even called ICE on someone - and one day you tell them, \u0026ldquo;Keep doing what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, but, by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s not about jobs anymore, now it\u0026rsquo;s about keeping Mexicans out,\u0026rdquo; a lot of them will roll with it. We like to think action follows belief, and sometimes it does, but at least as often it\u0026rsquo;s the reverse. And that\u0026rsquo;s a dangerous thing when given the choice to do something different or do the same thing only more.\nTo the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right.

I find their work very inspiring.\u0026rdquo; So you look a little deeper into the story, and you come to understand a few things. First, it turns out, by \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X\u0026rdquo; they mean an employee of Public Figure X. Well, employees are often acting on behalf of their employers; if your campaign staff meets with Russians, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say you are in contact with Russia, so maybe this is something like that. Also, it turns out that, by \u0026ldquo;employee\u0026rdquo; they mean a contractor that Public Figure X hired several years ago. Well, OK, if a contractor does something on behalf of a client, that\u0026rsquo;s often basically the same as an employee doing it. And, apparently, by \u0026ldquo;doxxed\u0026rdquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t mean Public Figure X - or Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s contractor - personally hacked anyone\u0026rsquo;s computer, they mean Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s people shared information that had been acquired by someone else. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s fair, if someone posts your home address on a forum and then the forum spreads it all over the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say the forum doxxed you. Oh, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a home address or a private email, it was the person\u0026rsquo;s name. Well, if you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous for safety reasons, having your name revealed can lead to threats or silencing, so, depending on why you\u0026rsquo;re anonymous, having your name leaked can be a kind of doxxing. Oh, and by \u0026ldquo;leaking a name,\u0026rdquo; they mean, liked a tweet that had the name in it.\n   OK, now say you\u0026rsquo;re bumming around Facebook - which, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, but I do it, too - and someone posts an article saying \u0026ldquo;All pornography is coercive.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty sweeping statement! I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta investigate this.\u0026rdquo; So you read the article, and it seems there\u0026rsquo;s a school of thought that, since, in porn, the product is usually images of women\u0026rsquo;s bodies, women tend to be socially pressured or financially incentivized to do things with their bodies that people like to see but they aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily comfortable with. Since that consent is not freely given, all pornography is coercive. And you think, \u0026ldquo;Well, but what about worker-owned porn collectives, or amateur porn that\u0026rsquo;s just exhiitionists who don\u0026rsquo;t monetize their videos?\u0026rdquo; And, after digging around the author\u0026rsquo;s work, you find, buried in a footnote in another article, that, in their opinion, if it\u0026rsquo;s worker-owned or unmonetized, it isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;porn,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;erotica.\u0026rdquo;\n   Now say you\u0026rsquo;ve ambled into the wildlands of Tumblr - woe betide the ones who travel too far from their dashboards - and you come across the claim that \u0026ldquo;[Activist Y] is a bigot.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, \u0026ldquo;Ah jeez, first Public Figure X and now this?\u0026rdquo; So you read a number of other posts on the subject, and eventually piece together that, by \u0026ldquo;bigot,\u0026rdquo; the people making this claim mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; - which, no question, that is a bigotry - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex worker\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; - which, OK, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; - which is definitely a stretch - and by \u0026ldquo;prudish\u0026rdquo; they mean \u0026ldquo;is critical of the sexual objectification of women in Fantasy imagery because they believe it drives women away from the community.\u0026rdquo;\n   How many words can you change in an argument until it\u0026rsquo;s not the same argument anymore?\n   There are a few different aims when somebody does this:\n  Making the unacceptable acceptable\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Activist Y is against sexual objectification\u0026rdquo; is not controversial amongst progressives. If you go after Activist Y for that belief, you\u0026rsquo;re going to make progressive enemies. But if you redefine this as \u0026ldquo;anti-sex,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;anti-sex\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;a bigot,\u0026rdquo; now it\u0026rsquo;s Activist Y who has the enemies, and you\u0026rsquo;ve just smuggled an anti-feminist argument into feminist language.\n  Making the unremarkable remarkable\n\u0026ldquo;Some pornography is coercive\u0026rdquo; is not the kind of take that sells magazine subscriptions. But if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a private definition of \u0026ldquo;pornography\u0026rdquo; that excludes sexually explicit material that isn\u0026rsquo;t coercive, you\u0026rsquo;ve got yourself a provocative headline, especially since, at first glance, nobody knows you\u0026rsquo;re using a nonstandard definition of the word.\n  Cutting people off from their communities\nThe statement \u0026ldquo;Someone who used to work with Public Figure X liked a tweet that had my name in it\u0026rdquo; gets converted into \u0026ldquo;Public Figure X doxxed me\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of turning Public Figure X\u0026rsquo;s community against them, with the added benefit of gaining favor with anyone who already hates them. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard abusive [relationship] tactic: if you want to mistreat someone, first you cut them off from their friends.\n  [formatting added]\n   One can make the (already dubious) argument that this isnt technically a lie, but it\u0026rsquo;s meant to form a picture in your mind of something that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen [\u0026hellip;].\n   [\u0026hellip;] when the Right does this, it does it to the Left, and, when the Left does this, it does it to itself. The Far Right is perfectly happy converting an attack or a bad argument into whatever they think progressive language sounds like, and bigots on the Left are perfectly happy sneaking transphobic arguments into feminism, but the Left, by and large, will not touch conservative language. We don\u0026rsquo;t try to isolate a member of the Alt-Right by telling his community he\u0026rsquo;s a race traitor or secretly gay.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2018. “The Ship of Theseus.” Tumblr.

It\u0026rsquo;s like a hammer in that a hammer is morally neutral and acquires a moral balance through use.\nThoughts Notes  [\u0026hellip;] two of the most powerful tools for making any marginalized group less marginalized are Language and Visibility.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n[\u0026hellip;] as a fringe group becomes more visible, and their language becomes commonplace, their presence in society starts to seem normal. They become demystified. Some people who thought they were strange and threatening will start to warm up to them, though this does not happen across the board. Many who hated them when they were fringe will see their becoming mainstream as a kind of existential occupation of territory, as in \u0026ldquo;If this is normal now, what does that make me?\u0026rdquo;\n   [\u0026hellip;] let\u0026rsquo;s not beat around the bush: Language and Visibility are tools of consolidating power. Visibility means having a sense of your numbers. Common language means forming alliances.\n   Culture is plastic. Any fringe group or idea can become normalized, regardless of its inherent worth. And, for a certain subset of extremely online people with fringe beliefs, who understand the ways mainstreaming has evolved in the attention economy, it can be a weapon.\n   Mainstreaming is not a wholly organic process, because usually the people who get mainstreamed are actively working to become so. But people usually have only so much control over how and how fast this happens: A group expands its language and visibility; if this leads to larger numbers and greater mainstream acceptance, the process repeats, this time with a bigger group and a bigger audience; so long as there is growth, each cycle is more impactful, as the bigger a group is the faster it gets even bigger and the more common language becomes the faster it proliferates.\n   By all rights, if your beliefs are wildly unpopular, this process shouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. Your language and visibility don\u0026rsquo;t expand because too many people don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk like you or about you. So what do you do then? Well, normally, you either give up or bide your time, but, if you have a lot of media literacy and no real moral compass, you get it done dirty.\nIf the media doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to cover you, make yourself newsworthy. Threaten to publicly out immigrants in front of a crowd. Start a hoax about white student unions. Lead a white power rally and leave the hoods at home. Do the kinds of things that journalists cannot, in good conscience, ignore. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve made yourself news, they\u0026rsquo;ll feel they can\u0026rsquo;t publish a condemnation without getting your side of the story, so, bam, you\u0026rsquo;ve got an interview. The more erratic and dangerous you seem, the more they\u0026rsquo;ll want to write a profile so people can figure you out; the article about how surprisingly normal you seem in person basically writes itself. If you want to spread a conspiracy theory, send it to a small, local news site that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the resources to fact check you; once they publish something salacious, all the bigger news channels will have to talk about it, if only to debunk it. Put provocative stuff in front of politicians; anything they retweet has to be news. In a pinch, you can always piggyback off a famous activist by making takedown videos, or, if you\u0026rsquo;re really ambitious, harass someone at a conference.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s desperate for clicks. If you can generate them, you\u0026rsquo;ll get your message out.\nIf nobody\u0026rsquo;s adopting your language, adopt it for them. Make sure you and all your friends each have half a dozen fake Twitter accounts spamming the same terminology at everyone who discusses race, gender, orientation, or ability. Put every Jewish name in parentheses until everyone on the internet knows what that means whether they want to or not. Hell, don\u0026rsquo;t even do it yourself: Russia\u0026rsquo;s not the only one who can make bots. Make thousands of bots. And make sure your real account, your fake accounts, and your bots all talk the same so no one can tell the difference anymore. Make hashtags and get them trending all by yourself, and, while you\u0026rsquo;re at it, spam all the hashtags for movements you hate with porn and gore so they can\u0026rsquo;t be used. And if your words and memes still aren\u0026rsquo;t popular? Just steal words and memes that are already popular. Just decide \u0026ldquo;this? this means white power now,\u0026rdquo; [Pepe the frog] \u0026ldquo;this is antifeminist now\u0026rdquo; [\u0026ldquo;triggered\u0026rdquo;]. Saturate the web with your new usage, always insisting that you\u0026rsquo;re doing it \u0026ldquo;ironically,\u0026rdquo; [For the lulz] while eroding confidence in anyone who uses these words in the original sense. And never stop insisting that most everyone would talk the same as you if there weren\u0026rsquo;t so much damn censorship.\n   And where Delany saw a group of 80 or 90 gay men reported in the papers as a group of 4 or 5, the Alt-Right wants to get reported as being much larger than it actually is. They want to draw attention to themselves by any means necessary, up to and including violence, but to ensure that, any time the cameras train on a violent act, there is a man in a suit ready to distance himself from it; to paint the picture that, but for a few bad actors, this is a peaceful movement of young, presentable intellectuals.\n   Much as we\u0026rsquo;d like to believe people are driven by morality, most people are driven by the desire to be normal [Bob Altemeyer | The Authoritarians]. And when the news is filled with images of swastikas, iron crosses, and tiki torches, the guy in the suit with the fashy haircut looks pretty normal by comparison.

Display the outward signs of winning \u0026ndash; confidence, always have a comeback, speak in soundbites, attack attack attack \u0026ndash; and the audience may think that you won even if your opponent refutes your argument.\nNotes  You also notice the pattern of the conversation: he says something short, quippy, and wrong, you give a detailed correction, he says something else short, quippy, wrong, and only tangentially related to his last point, and the cycle repeats itself. This goes on and on.\n   The running theme here is all these people who ostensibly want a frank exchange of ideas spend a lot more time making accusations than asking questions. Because, why ask what you believe when they can tell you what you believe and make you correct them? And if you ever don\u0026rsquo;t correct them, must be because they\u0026rsquo;re right.\n   And you\u0026rsquo;re not naive; you see what\u0026rsquo;s going on here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about conversation, it\u0026rsquo;s about boxes. When you say something cogent that they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with, and they get the sinking feeling that you might start making sense, they need a reason not to listen to you [Cognitive dissonance]. So they reach for a box to stick you in: dishonest feminism, fake progressivism, daddy-issue liberalism. No one in those boxes is worth listening to, which means, as long as they\u0026rsquo;ve got you in one, they\u0026rsquo;re not at risk of having their minds changed. This isn\u0026rsquo;t even an argument with you, not really; their presenting themselves with arguments for why they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to you.\nSo your first reflex is to defy their expectations. \u0026ldquo;Actually, my dad was a draft-dodging hippie who told me he loved me every day.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And I never said what genders my partners are but I promise they\u0026rsquo;re all feminists.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As for my accent- actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do with the accent thing.\u0026rdquo; But the point is, \u0026ldquo;I refuse to fit in your box.\u0026rdquo; And if they can\u0026rsquo;t put you in one, if they can\u0026rsquo;t dismiss you outright, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to engage with your argument.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;ve spent any time arguing with angry dudes online you know what I\u0026rsquo;m about to say: They don\u0026rsquo;t. This accusatory, condescending attitude never falters. Because a technique that has permeated anti-progressivism is to Never Play Defense.\n   Now don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, what I said about the Right fitting the Left into simplified boxes as a way of preserving their own egos, I do think that\u0026rsquo;s a thing, at least for many people much of the time. And I think the reassurance it brings is why the technique stays so popular. But that framing is about how individual people are feeling in isolated moments, and leaves out the larger game that\u0026rsquo;s being played. Because there is a long-term strategic value to never playing defense, and it\u0026rsquo;s less to do with arguments than with attitude.\nFrom your perspective, this debate about the feminist is a joke. This guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what he\u0026rsquo;s talking about, he comes in hot without confirming any of his assumptions, the whole conversation is you repeatedly schooling an ignorant dipshit. But that\u0026rsquo;s only if you\u0026rsquo;re the fool who listens to what\u0026rsquo;s actually being said. Never Play Defense is a strategy that looks past language to posture; the tone, word choice, even the expressions on your faces. If you half-focus your eyes and look not at the words but the flow of the conversation, you can see the dynamic at play:\nHe says his short, quippy statement, and you give your detailed rebuttal. He then picks a single point from your response and attacks that as the new subject. Now, to an onlooker, the logical brain would register that he\u0026rsquo;s leaving 90% of your argument on the table, and that, by changing positions, he\u0026rsquo;s conceding he lost the first round. But the lizard brain notices that he\u0026rsquo;s always making the accusations, always in the dominant position, that he\u0026rsquo;s always acting and you\u0026rsquo;re always reacting. Regardless of what is said, he displays all the outward signs of winning. So, on a purely emotional level, he leaves the impression of being right.\nI have never had an argument look like this that wasn\u0026rsquo;t in public. This is a technique that means speaking not so much to the other person as to the people watching [Speak directly to the audience]. Liberals tend to operate as though voters are beings of pure reason, and neglect that rational people still have emotions, and those emotions factor into what they believe. And that long after this argument is over, when people only half-remember what was said, what lingers on is what impressions the speakers made.\nRonald Reagan coined the phrase, \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re explaining, you\u0026rsquo;re losing.\u0026rdquo; The trick is, if he\u0026rsquo;s always accusing, then you\u0026rsquo;re always explaining.\n   [\u0026hellip;] if you never look like you\u0026rsquo;re losing, you can convince a lot of people that you\u0026rsquo;re [winning]. And, if you keep your statements short and punchy, people will remember what you said better than they remember the long explanation of why it\u0026rsquo;s untrue. If done correctly, you might even convince yourself you know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\n   This argument isn\u0026rsquo;t just about sticking a woman in the Lying Feminism box so she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be listened to, it\u0026rsquo;s also signaling to anyone watching what box they should stick her in. Even if an onlooker recognizes that she literally did not con anyone out of their money, the idea that how much she asked for and how long she took to deliver are relevant to her credibility is still planted in their heads. It subtly suggests that, the next time they feel threatened by a female media critic, maybe they should look at how much money she makes, how long her work takes to produce; maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t have to listen to her, because they\u0026rsquo;ve got this handy box.\n[\u0026hellip;] The Alt-Right is a box factory, putting huge swaths of Leftist rhetoric, most especially that that would rebut their core positions, into categories where they can be summarily ignored.\n   A detailed explanation lands a lot better when it\u0026rsquo;s not being contrasted with a sound bite.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Never Play Defense.” Tumblr.

More specifically, it\u0026rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] every one of these bad arguments is a subtle attempt to change the subject.\n   What is the purpose of debate? The liberal conception of debate is usually along the lines of Joseph Joubert\u0026rsquo;s adage, \u0026ldquo;The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;re thinking Plato and Glaucon, or, maybe, debate club: two sides debate until one side wins or until a third conclusion is reached together; either way, the goal of debate is to arrive at the truth.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not what debate means on the Right. There, debate is a chance to perform strength, integrity, and certainty. There, you don\u0026rsquo;t debate until a victor is declared, you debate as long as you can keep eyeballs on you, forever if possible. There, the truth doesn\u0026rsquo;t win, because nobody wins, not in any formal way. You may scoff at that, but let\u0026rsquo;s think about it: this is how political debates are structured in the US, where two candidates come in already knowing everything they\u0026rsquo;re going to say, where it\u0026rsquo;s political suicide to concede any point or find any compromise, and where who \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; is up to the voters. In such a framework, truth and falsity don\u0026rsquo;t exist; all that matters is how much of the audience agrees with you. And, if that\u0026rsquo;s your framework, then what\u0026rsquo;s in your best interest is to steer the conversation swiftly and efficiently to something you and your opponent will never agree on, because that gives you the most opportunities to look firm in front of an adversary.\n   [\u0026hellip;] the Left\u0026rsquo;s understanding of systemic issues does not jive with the Right\u0026rsquo;s views on personal responsibility. Yes, of course, if the President spoke this way in the White House it might be alienating to any woman who works there, but the Right sees this as a personal failing on the part of the woman, not a systemic failing on the part of men. And all the articles, all the data, all the reports that say that\u0026rsquo;s now how things work in practice, they are useless in the framework of a performative Twitter argument or a one-hour TV debate. A proper understanding of institutional sexism just takes longer than that.\n   Why would anyone use this framework? Well, if your opposition has facts on their side, then you need a framework where facts aren\u0026rsquo;t important. But, more broadly, if the goal is to win over the public, well, the public does respond to honesty, but they also respond to moral certainty, and the Right tends to sell certainty better than the Left sells truth. This is what they\u0026rsquo;re good at; this suits their worldview. They speak of a universe where opposing sides never agree, because agreement is impossible. And, since agreement is impossible, you never have to compromise. And, since politics isn\u0026rsquo;t about compromise, it\u0026rsquo;s just about outnumbering your competition by any means necessary and obstructing them at every turn when they outnumber you. There is comfort in the idea that people are just fundamentally different, and that they owe each other nothing.\n   [\u0026hellip;] the Democrats' desire for compromise is a weakness that can be exploited. On a gut level, the Right knows what debate means on the Left, knows that the Left wants to meet in the middle. So all they have to do is bait the Left into having the discussion on their terms and then keep insisting they should find common ground. \u0026ldquo;You could work with us if you\u0026rsquo;d only try a little harder.\u0026rdquo; Because the rules of that debate, where you concede points and look for compromise, in their world, make the Left look weak. As long as the Right controls the terms of debate, conciliatory loses.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how they control the conversation: move the entire debate to their framework using a bad argument as the worm on the hook.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Danskin, Ian. 2017. “Control the Conversation.” Tumblr.

In short: tolerance and forgiveness aren\u0026rsquo;t easy and if they feel easy then you\u0026rsquo;re likely not actually tolerating or forgiving but rather remarking \u0026ldquo;No harm done.\u0026rdquo;\nThoughts Tolerance of intolerance Regarding the bit about Brendan Eich1:\n Think of Brendan Eich as a member of a tiny religious minority surrounded by people who hate that minority. Suddenly firing him doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\n Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m either (1) misinterpreting Scott Alexander here or (2) showing my tribal bias too blatantly but this reads as:\n Think of the persecutor as a member of the persecuted. Suddenly resisting them doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very noble.\n Hot take: Political beliefs aren\u0026rsquo;t just an intellectual exercise \u0026ndash; they have consequences. Resisting the expansion of power by those who hold incompatible political opinions is a good thing. Scott Alexander continues:\n And if you mix together the open-source tech industry and the parallel universe where you can\u0026rsquo;t wear a FreeBSD t-shirt without risking someone trying to exorcise you, you can prove that Christians are scary and very powerful people who are persecuting everyone else all the time, and you have a great excuse for kicking one of the few people willing to affiliate with the Red Tribe, a guy who never hurt anyone, out of town.\nWhen a friend of mine heard Eich got fired, she didn\u0026rsquo;t see anything wrong with it. \u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except intolerance,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Intolerance\u0026rdquo; is starting to look like another one of those words like \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.\u0026rdquo; Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound quite so noble now, does it?\n[link added]\n I take exception with \u0026ldquo;a guy who never hurt anyone\u0026rdquo; which is only true in the sense that I don\u0026rsquo;t know of Eich every assaulting anyone. However, support for anti-same-sex marriage legislation does hurt people.\nBlue and red tribes I\u0026rsquo;m not sure Red and Blue tribes (which seem to approximate Rural and Urban americans) are the ultimate definition but I agree that they\u0026rsquo;re a better clustering tool than Republican and Democrat. That is, two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Blue tribe (as opposed to Red tribe) are more likely, in my opinion, than two randomly-selected individuals who self-identify as Democrat (as opposed to Republican).\nNotes  So what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don\u0026rsquo;t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you\u0026rsquo;ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.\n   The people who are actually into this sort of thing sketch out a bunch of speculative tribes and subtribes, but to make it easier, let me stick with two and a half.\nThe Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting \u0026ldquo;USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!\u0026rdquo;, and listening to country music.\nThe Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to \u0026ldquo;everything except country\u0026rdquo;.\n   And my hypothesis, stated plainly, is that if you\u0026rsquo;re part of the Blue Tribe, then your outgroup isn\u0026rsquo;t al-Qaeda, or Muslims, or blacks, or gays, or transpeople, or Jews, or atheists – it\u0026rsquo;s the Red Tribe.\n   My hunch – both the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe, for whatever reason, identify \u0026ldquo;America\u0026rdquo; with the Red Tribe. Ask people for typically \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; things, and you end up with a very Red list of characteristics – guns, religion, barbecues, American football, NASCAR, cowboys, SUVs, unrestrained capitalism.\nThat means the Red Tribe feels intensely patriotic about \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; country, and the Blue Tribe feels like they\u0026rsquo;re living in fortified enclaves deep in hostile territory.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOn both sides, \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; can be either a normal demonym, or a code word for a member of the Red Tribe.\n   But I think the situation with \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; is much the same as the situation with \u0026ldquo;American\u0026rdquo; – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.\n    On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla Corporation. The appointment triggered widespread criticism due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s past political donations – specifically, a 2008 donation of \\$1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the banning of same-sex marriage in California, and donations in the amount of \\$2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom McClintock between 2008 and 2010. The Wall Street Journal initially reported that, in protest against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff) stepped down, leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert. CNET later reported that of the three board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Lilly told The New York Times, \u0026ldquo;I left rather than appoint him\u0026rdquo;, and declined to elaborate further.\nOn March 26, 2014, Eich expressed \u0026ldquo;sorrow for causing pain\u0026rdquo; and pledged to \u0026ldquo;work with LGBT communities and allies\u0026rdquo; at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about Eich\u0026rsquo;s donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link to continue with Firefox). CREDO Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich resign.\nAfter 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla over his opposition to same-sex marriage. In his personal blog, he posted, \u0026ldquo;under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader\u0026rdquo;. Mozilla made a press release saying that board members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.\n(“Brendan Eich” 2022)\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2014. “I Can Tolerate Anything Except The Outgroup.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/. “Brendan Eich.” 2022.

The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived. Sometimes the dragon would devour these unfortunate souls upon arrival; sometimes again it would lock them up in the mountain where they would wither away for months or years before eventually being consumed.\nThe misery inflicted by the dragon tyrant was incalculable. In addition to the ten thousand who were gruesomely slaughtered each day, there were the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, children, and friends who were left behind to grieve the loss of their departed loved ones.\nSome people tried to fight the dragon, but whether they were brave or foolish was difficult to say. Priests and magicians called down curses, to no avail. Warriors, armed with roaring courage and the best weapons the smiths could produce, attacked it, but were incinerated by its fire before coming close enough to strike. Chemists concocted toxic brews and tricked the dragon into swallowing them, but the only apparent effect was to further stimulate its appetite. The dragon\u0026rsquo;s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armour so impregnable, and its whole nature so robust, as to make it invincible to any human assault.\nSeeing that defeating the tyrant was impossible, humans had no choice but to obey its commands and pay the grisly tribute. The fatalities selected were always elders. Although senior people were as vigorous and healthy as the young, and sometimes wiser, the thinking was that they had at least already enjoyed a few decades of life. The wealthy might gain a brief reprieve by bribing the press gangs that came to fetch them, but, by constitutional law, nobody, not even the king himself, could put off their turn indefinitely.\nSpiritual men sought to comfort those who were afraid of being eaten by the dragon (which included almost everyone, although many denied it in public) by promising another life after death, a life that would be free from the dragon scourge. Other orators argued that the dragon had its place in the natural order and a moral right to be fed. They said it was part of the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s stomach. Others still maintained that the dragon was good for the human species because it kept the population size down. To what extent these arguments convinced the worried souls is not known. Most people tried to cope by not thinking about the grim end that awaited them.\nFor many centuries this desperate state of affairs continued. Nobody kept count any longer of the cumulative death toll, nor of the number of tears shed by the bereft. Expectations had gradually adjusted and the dragon tyrant had become a fact of life. In view of the evident futility of resistance, attempts to kill the dragon had ceased. Instead, efforts now focused on placating it. Although the dragon would occasionally raid the cities, it was found that the punctual delivery to the mountain of its quota of life reduced the frequency of these incursions.\nKnowing that their turn to become dragon fodder was always impending, people began having children earlier and more often. It was not uncommon for a girl to be pregnant by her sixteenth birthday. Couples often spawned a dozen children. The human population was thus kept from shrinking, and the dragon was kept from going hungry.\nOver the course of these centuries, the dragon, being well fed, slowly but steadily grew bigger. It had become almost as large as the mountain on which it lived and its appetite had increased proportionately. Ten thousand human bodies were no longer enough to fill its belly. It now demanded eighty thousand, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.\nWhat occupied the king\u0026rsquo;s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself was the logistics of collecting and transporting so many people to the mountain every day. This was not an easy task.\nTo facilitate the process, the king had a railway track constructed: two straight lines of glistening steel leading up to the dragon\u0026rsquo;s abode. Every twenty minutes, a train would arrive at the mountain terminal crammed with people, and would return empty. On moonlit nights, the passengers travelling on this train, if there had been windows for them to stick their heads out of, would have been able to see in front of them the double silhouette of the dragon and the mountain, and two glowing red eyes, like the beams from a pair of giant lighthouses, pointing the way to annihilation.\nServants were employed by the king in large numbers to administer the tribute. There were registrars who kept track of whose turn it was to be sent. There were people collectors who would be dispatched in special carts to fetch the designated people. Often travelling at breakneck speed, they would rush their cargo either to a railway station or directly to the mountain. There were clerks who administered the pensions paid to the decimated families who were no longer able to support themselves. There were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon, trying to ease their anguish with spirits and drugs.\nThere was, moreover, a cadre of dragonologists, who studied how these logistical processes could be made more efficient. Some dragonologists also conducted studies of the dragon\u0026rsquo;s physiology and behaviour, and collected samples—its shed scales, the slime that drooled from its jaws, its lost teeth, and its excrements, which were specked with fragments of human bone. All these items were painstakingly annotated and archived. The more the beast was understood, the more the general perception of its invincibility was confirmed. Its black scales, in particular, were harder than any material known to man, and there seemed no way to make as much as a scratch in its armour.\nTo finance all these activities, the king levied heavy taxes on his people. Dragon related expenditures, already accounting for one seventh of the economy, were growing even faster than the dragon itself.\nHumanity is a curious species. Every once in a while, somebody gets a good idea. Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements. Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed. Some of these devices—calculators, thermometers, microscopes, and the glass vials that the chemists use to boil and distil liquids—serve to make it easier to generate and try out new ideas, including ideas that expedite the process of idea generation.\nThus the great wheel of invention, which had turned at an almost imperceptibly slow pace in the older ages, gradually began to accelerate.\nSages predicted that a day would come when technology would enable humans to fly and do many other astonishing things. One of the sages, who was held in high esteem by some of the other sages but whose eccentric manners had made him a social outcast and recluse, went so far as to predict that technology would eventually make it possible to build a contraption that could kill the dragon tyrant.\nThe king\u0026rsquo;s scholars, however, dismissed these ideas. They said that humans were far too heavy to fly and in any case lacked feathers. As for the impossible notion that the dragon tyrant could be killed, history books recounted hundreds of attempts to do just that, not one of which had been successful. \u0026ldquo;We all know that this man had some irresponsible ideas,\u0026rdquo; a scholar of letters later wrote in his obituary of the reclusive sage who had by then been sent off to be devoured by the beast whose demise he had foretold, \u0026ldquo;but his writings were quite entertaining and perhaps we should be grateful to the dragon for making possible the interesting genre of dragon bashing literature which reveals so much about the culture of angst!\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, the wheel of invention kept turning. Mere decades later, humans did fly and accomplished many other astonishing things.\nA few iconoclastic dragonologists began arguing for a new attack on the dragon tyrant. Killing the dragon would not be easy, they said, but if some material could be invented that was harder than the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour, and if this material could be fashioned into some kind of projectile, then maybe the feat would be possible. At first, the iconoclasts' ideas were rejected by their dragonologist peers on grounds that no known material was harder than dragon scales. But after working on the problem for many years, one of the iconoclasts succeeded in demonstrating that a dragon scale could be pierced by an object made of a certain composite material. Many dragonologists who had previously been sceptical now joined the iconoclasts. Engineers calculated that a huge projectile could be made of this material and launched with sufficient force to penetrate the dragon\u0026rsquo;s armour.\nThe manufacture of the needed quantity of the composite material would, however, be expensive.\nA group of several eminent engineers and dragonologists sent a petition to the king asking for funding to build the antidragon projectile. At the time when the petition was sent, the king was preoccupied with leading his army into war against a tiger. The tiger had killed a farmer and subsequently disappeared into the jungle. There was widespread fear in the countryside that the tiger might come out and strike again. The king had the jungle surrounded and ordered his troops to begin slashing their way through it. At the conclusion of the campaign, the king could announce that all 163 tigers in the jungle, including presumably the murderous one, had been hunted down and killed. During the tumult of the war, however, the petition had been lost or forgotten.\nThe petitioners therefore sent another appeal. This time they received a reply from one of the king\u0026rsquo;s secretaries saying that the king would consider their request after he was done reviewing the annual dragon administration budget. This year\u0026rsquo;s budget was the largest to date and included funding for a new railway track to the mountain. A second track was deemed necessary, as the original track could no longer support the increasing traffic. (The tribute demanded by the dragon tyrant had increased to one hundred thousand human beings, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.) When the budget was finally approved, however, reports were coming from a remote part of the country that a village was suffering from a rattlesnake infestation. The king had to leave urgently to mobilise his army and ride off to defeat this new threat. The antidragonists' appeal was filed away in a dusty cabinet in the castle basement.\nThe antidragonists met again to decide what was to be done. The debate was animated and continued long into the night. It was almost daybreak when they finally resolved to take the matter to the people. Over the following weeks, they travelled around the country, gave public lectures, and explained their proposal to anyone who would listen. At first, people were sceptical. They had been taught in school that the dragon tyrant was invincible and that the sacrifices it demanded had to be accepted as a fact of life. Yet when they learnt about the new composite material and about the designs for the projectile, many became intrigued. In increasing numbers, citizens flocked to the antidragonist lectures. Activists started organising public rallies in support of the proposal.\nWhen the king read about these meetings in the newspaper, he summoned his advisors and asked them what they thought about them. They informed him about the petitions that had been sent but told him that the antidragonists were troublemakers whose teachings were causing public unrest. It was much better for the social order, they said, that the people accepted the inevitability of the dragon tyrant tribute. The dragon administration provided many jobs that would be lost if the dragon was slaughtered. There was no known social good coming from the conquest of the dragon. In any case, the king\u0026rsquo;s coffers were currently nearly empty after the two military campaigns and the funding set aside for the second railway line. The king, who was at the time enjoying great popularity for having vanquished the rattlesnake infestation, listened to his advisors' arguments but worried that he might lose some of his popular support if he was seen to ignore the antidragonist petition. He therefore decided to hold an open hearing. Leading dragonologists, ministers of the state, and interested members of the public were invited to attend.\nThe meeting took place on the darkest day of the year, just before the Christmas holidays, in the largest hall of the royal castle. The hall was packed to the last seat and people were crowding in the aisles. The mood was charged with an earnest intensity normally reserved for pivotal wartime sessions.\nAfter the king had welcomed everyone, he gave the floor to the leading scientist behind the antidragonist proposal, a woman with a serious, almost stern expression on her face. She proceeded to explain in clear language how the proposed device would work and how the requisite amount of the composite material could be manufactured. Given the requested amount of funding, it should be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years. With an even greater amount of funding, it might be possible to do it in as little as twelve years. There could, however, be no absolute guarantee that it would work. The crowd followed her presentation intently.\nNext to speak was the king\u0026rsquo;s chief advisor for morality, a man with a booming voice that easily filled the auditorium.\n\u0026ldquo;Let us grant that this woman is correct about the science and that the project is technologically possible, although I don\u0026rsquo;t think that has actually been proven. Now she desires that we get rid of the dragon. Presumably, she thinks she\u0026rsquo;s got the right not to be chewed up by the dragon. How wilful and presumptuous. The finitude of human life is a blessing for every individual, whether he knows it or not. Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem like such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our human dignity. The preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realising more fully the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive. It is debasing, yes debasing, for a person to want to continue his or her mediocre life for as long as possible without worrying about some of the higher questions about what life is to be used for. But I tell you, the nature of the dragon is to eat humans, and our own species specified nature is truly and nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten by it\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe audience listened respectfully to this highly decorated speaker. The phrases were so eloquent that it was hard to resist the feeling that some deep thoughts must lurk behind them, although nobody could quite grasp what they were. Surely, words coming from such a distinguished appointee of the king must have profound substance.\nThe speaker next in line was a spiritual sage who was widely respected for his kindness and gentleness as well as for his devotion. As he strode to the podium, a small boy yelled out from the audience: \u0026ldquo;The dragon is bad!\u0026rdquo;\nThe boy\u0026rsquo;s parents turned bright red and began hushing and scolding the child. But the sage said: \u0026ldquo;Let the boy speak. He is probably wiser than an old fool like me.\u0026rdquo;\nAt first, the boy was too scared and confused to move but when he saw the genuinely friendly smile on the sage\u0026rsquo;s face and the outreached hand, he obediently took it and followed the sage up to the podium. \u0026ldquo;Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a brave little man,\u0026rdquo; said the sage. \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid of the dragon?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want my granny back,\u0026rdquo; said the boy.\n\u0026ldquo;Did the dragon take your granny away?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; the boy said, tears welling up in his large frightened eyes. \u0026ldquo;Granny promised that she would teach me how to bake gingerbread cookies for Christmas. She said that we would make a little house out of gingerbread and little gingerbread men that would live in it. Then those people in white clothes came and took Granny away to the dragon\u0026hellip;The dragon is bad and it eats people…I want my Granny back!\u0026rdquo;\nAt this point the child was crying so hard that the sage had to return him to his parents.\nThere were several other speakers that evening, but the child\u0026rsquo;s simple testimony had punctured the rhetorical balloon that the king\u0026rsquo;s ministers had tried to inflate. The people were backing the antidragonists, and by the end of the evening even the king had come to recognise the reason and the humanity of their cause. In his closing statement, he simply said: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the news spread, celebrations erupted in the streets. Those who had been campaigning for the antidragonists toasted each other and drank to the future of humanity.\nThe next morning, a billion people woke up and realised that their turn to be sent to the dragon would come before the projectile would be completed. A tipping point was reached. Whereas before, active support for the antidragonist cause had been limited to a small group of visionaries, it now became the number one priority and concern on everybody\u0026rsquo;s mind. The abstract notion of \u0026ldquo;the general will\u0026rdquo; took on an almost tangible intensity and concreteness. Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase the level of state support. The king responded to these appeals. In his New Year address, he announced that he would pass an extra appropriations bill to support the project at a high level of funding; additionally, he would sell off his summer castle and some of his land and make a large personal donation. \u0026ldquo;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon tyrant.\u0026rdquo;\nThus started a great technological race against time. The concept of an antidragon projectile was simple, but to make it a reality required solutions to a thousand smaller technical problems, each of which required dozens of time consuming steps and missteps. Test missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction. In one tragic accident, a wayward missile landed on a hospital and killed several hundred patients and staff. Now, however, there was a real seriousness of purpose, and the tests continued even as the corpses were being dug out from the debris.\nDespite almost unlimited funding and round the clock work by the technicians, the king\u0026rsquo;s deadline could not be met. The decade concluded and the dragon was still alive and well. The effort, however, was getting closer. A prototype missile had been successfully test fired. Production of the core, made of the expensive composite material, was on schedule for its completion to coincide with the finishing of the fully tested and debugged missile shell into which it was to be loaded. The launch date was set to be the following year\u0026rsquo;s New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, exactly twelve years after the project\u0026rsquo;s official inauguration. The best selling Christmas gift that year was a calendar that counted down the days to time zero, the proceeds going to the projectile project.\nThe king had undergone a personal transformation from his earlier frivolous and thoughtless self. He now spent as much time as he could in the laboratories and the manufacturing plants, encouraging the workers, and praising their toil. Sometimes he would bring a sleeping bag and spend the night on a noisy machine floor. He even studied and tried to understand the technical aspects of their work. Yet he confined himself to giving moral support and refrained from meddling in technical and managerial matters.\nSeven days before New Year, the woman who had made the case for the project almost twelve years earlier, and was now its chief executive, came to the royal castle and requested an urgent audience with the king. When the king got her note, he excused himself to the foreign dignitaries whom he was reluctantly entertaining at the annual Christmas dinner and hurried off to the private room where the scientist was waiting. As always of late, she looked pale and worn from her long working hours. This evening, however, the king also thought he could detect a ray of relief and satisfaction in her eyes.\nShe told him that the missile had been deployed, the core had been loaded, everything had been triple checked, they were ready to launch, and would the king give his final go ahead. The king sank down in an armchair and closed his eyes. He was thinking hard. By launching the projectile tonight, one week early, seven hundred thousand people would be saved. Yet if something went wrong, if it missed its target and hit the mountain instead, it would be a disaster. A new core would have to be constructed from scratch and the project would be set back by some four years. He sat there, silently, for almost an hour. Just as the scientist had become convinced that he had fallen asleep, he opened his eyes and said in a firm voice: \u0026ldquo;No. I want you to go right back to the lab. I want you to check and then recheck everything again.\u0026rdquo; The scientist could not help a sigh escaping her; but she nodded and left.\nThe last day of the year was cold and overcast, but there was no wind, which meant good launch conditions. The sun was setting. Technicians were scuttling around making the final adjustments and giving everything one last check. The king and his closest advisors were observing from a platform close to the launch pad. Further away, behind a fence, large numbers of the public had assembled to witness the great event. A large clock was showing the countdown: fifty minutes to go.\nAn advisor tapped the king on the shoulder and drew his attention to the fence. There was some tumult. Somebody had apparently jumped the fence and was running toward the platform where the king sat. Security quickly caught up with him. He was handcuffed and taken away. The king turned his attention back to the launch pad, and to the mountain in the background. In front of it, he could see the dark slumped profile of the dragon. It was eating.\nSome twenty minutes later, the king was surprised to see the handcuffed man reappearing a short distance from the platform. His nose was bleeding and he was accompanied by two security guards. The man appeared to be in frenzied state. When he spotted the king, he began shouting at the top of his lungs: \u0026ldquo;The last train! The last train! Stop the last train!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who is this young man?\u0026rdquo; said the king. \u0026ldquo;His face seems familiar, but I cannot quite place him. What does he want? Let him come up.\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation, and the reason for his frenzy was that he had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain. The king had ordered the train traffic to continue, fearing that any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and leave the open field in front of the mountain where it now spent most of its time. The young man begged the king to issue a recall order for the last train, which was due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot do it,\u0026rdquo; said the king, \u0026ldquo;I cannot take the risk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the trains frequently run five minutes late. The dragon won\u0026rsquo;t notice! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man was kneeling before the king, imploring him to save his father\u0026rsquo;s life and the lives of the other thousand passengers onboard that last train.\nThe king looked down at the pleading, bloodied face of the young man, but he bit his lip, and shook his head. The young man continued to wail even as the guards carried him off the platform: \u0026ldquo;Please! Stop the last train! Please!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stood silent and motionless, until, after a while, the wailing suddenly ceased. The king looked up and glanced over at the countdown clock: five minutes remaining.\nFour minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.\nThe last technician left the launch pad.\n30 seconds. 20 seconds. Ten, nine, eight…\nAs a ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out, the spectators instinctively rose to the tips of their toes, and all eyes fixated at the front end of the white flame from the rocket\u0026rsquo;s afterburners, heading towards the distant mountain. The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, it was as if at this moment they shared a single awareness, a single conscious experience: that white flame, shooting into the dark, embodying the human spirit, its fear and its hope…striking at the heart of evil. The silhouette on the horizon tumbled, and fell. A thousand voices of pure joy rose from the assembled masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn out thud from the collapsing monster as if the Earth itself was drawing a sigh of relief. After centuries of oppression, humanity at last was free from the cruel tyranny of the dragon.\nThe joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant: \u0026ldquo;Long live the king! Long live us all!\u0026rdquo; The king\u0026rsquo;s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: \u0026ldquo;We did it! We did it!\u0026rdquo;\nThe king, however, answered in a broken voice: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late? This could have been done five, maybe ten years ago! Millions of people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had to die.\u0026rdquo;\nThe king stepped off the platform and walked up to the young man in handcuffs, who was sitting on the ground. There he fell down on his knees. \u0026ldquo;Forgive me! Oh my God, please forgive me!\u0026rdquo;\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Bostrom, N. 2005. “The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant.” Journal of Medical Ethics 31 (5): 273–77. https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2004.009035.

It may be trite to say you should Just Start or to Drop Unimportant Tasks; however, these simple truths are still true and I often forget them.\nNotes Skeleton Table of Contents Busy Person Patterns – An Introduction Just Start  You have a task that cannot wait until you have all the information about it to begin. It may be time sensitive, you may have a deadline, or part of the task may be to identify its parts. Most important, you feel internal or external pressure to begin and have some level of confidence about the task\u0026rsquo;s overall direction.\n[Negatives]\n The initial information given with a task may not be conducive to understanding it immediately. Tasks may be vague in their definition. Just by starting a task, you do not guarantee that you can figure it out and complete it. You can waste time fumbling through starting the task without a clear idea what you need to do. While you are starting one task, you are putting off other tasks. Some organizations may punish initiative. You may be afraid to start.  [Positives]\n By not starting a task, you do not know whether you can complete it. If you do not start a task, you cannot complete it. Starting something new can be satisfying and give you a sense of accomplishment.  Therefore, when faced with a vague task, start working on it to see if the steps you need to complete it emerge.\n    Commentary\n Procrastination is the enemy of a busy person.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Contiguous Time Blocks Related: Deep work\n You have the information you need to complete a task and you are determining how you will complete it. You have several other tasks you need to complete and you frequently fragment your time. You feel that you must prevent interruptions to advance this task.\n[Negatives]\n Setting aside time does not guarantee it will not be interrupted. It is not always possible to obtain contiguous time blocks.  [Positives]\n Complex tasks require a certain amount of think time to be completed. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated. Smaller allocated time blocks create interruptions that cause you to stop and re-start a task.  Therefore, set aside a block of time to complete the task so that you are able to perform the task without interruption until you are comfortable with how the task is progressing.\n    Commentary\n This is a pattern about limiting interruptions so that you can concentrate on a complex task. Interruptions can come in at least two forms: Those you impose upon yourself through fragmenting your time and those that outside forces impose upon you. Even though there is a potential task re-start penalty when you impose interruptions upon yourself, there is a quantifiable task re-start consequence when outside influences interrupt you. When you interrupt yourself, you typically do it at a logical break point – a time when you feel comfortable you can stop the task. When outside influences cause an interruption, however, your concentration on a complex problem is broken and you need to re-establish it to continue.\n      Resulting Context\n Be careful not to take this pattern to an extreme. If you completely de-fragment your time, you will be unable to complete important tasks that may have an earlier due date because you will not interrupt yourself to address them.\n     Examples  Single-Task Important Items  You have a task to do that you and/or others consider important. Performing this task simultaneously with other tasks breaks your concentration and you find that quality is suffering. You feel that the task warrants a quality level that is impossible to produce if you perform it with other tasks.\n[Negatives]\n Interruptions are an unpleasant fact. It is often impossible to find time to work on only one thing because of pressure from others though in-person visits, email, IM, telephone calls, or pages. Single tasking does not guarantee that the results will be better than if you multitasked. When you perform a single task, you may be putting off tasks that are more important or time critical.  [Positives]\n Important tasks, like complex tasks, require a certain amount of think time to be completed. What makes an important task different from a complex task is there is a need to attend to details – the output is important. Human concentration, when broken, can cause a task to take longer than originally anticipated and produce work that is not befitting the task. Working on one important task may help you solve another complex problem. When you fragment your time by completing multiple tasks in the same time block, you decrease the amount of concentration and attention you can give to an important task. There is a certain level of satisfaction knowing that you are producing high quality results.  Therefore, isolate important tasks and perform them separately so that you have the ability to concentrate and produce high quality output in the required amount of time.\n    Commentary\n This pattern is different from Contiguous Time Blocks. Single-Task Important Items does not refer to blocking off time for a task, but refers to concentration on a single important task at a time.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Put It Off  You have a task to complete and you are having trouble concentrating on it either because it is complex, you are fatigued, or it is large. You find that you are having difficulty advancing the task or that the task itself is becoming more confusing. Most important, you feel you do not have a good handle on how to organize the task, its output, or both.\n[Negatives]\n Procrastination can make a task more difficult to complete. When you are extremely fatigued, setting aside a task or sleeping may or may not help you organize your thoughts. It may not be possible to put it off certain tasks due to pressure to complete a task. Putting a task off might not result in a better organization or output.  [Positives]\n When you have trouble concentrating, the work you are trying to complete takes longer. When you have trouble concentrating, quality suffers. Complex (or boring) tasks drain your mental resources. Setting a problem aside gives your mind time to mull over the information it has already absorbed while you are doing other things. By better organizing a task or its output, it may become easier complete.  Therefore, when faced with poor concentration on a boring or complex task with a somewhat flexible deadline, stop working on it temporarily so you can collect your thoughts. It may help to sleep on the problem and begin working it anew once you awaken.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n If you put something off that will not benefit from downtime thinking, you are essentially procrastinating – an alternate, less appealing resulting context. In addition, it is possible for you to think you can put something down in order to organize your thoughts, but if there is no plan to return to it, it is probably procrastination.\n     Examples  Seek Clarification  You have a task to complete which is vague or has vague instructions. The task may have an aggressive deadline. Just starting the task to learn its direction does not appear to be an option. Most significant, you feel that you cannot begin the task unless you have clear instructions or you obtain additional information.\n[Negatives]\n By requesting clarification, you could irritate the individual or organization giving the task (discretion and politeness is required). The time used to clarify a task may take away from the time you have to complete it. Some organizations view asking for help as a sign of weakness and discourage people from seeking clarification.  [Positives]\n When a timed task is vague, you need to determine what is truly required quickly. Vague tasks take a lot of time to figure out and you could be wrong if you guess. The amount of time taken to complete a vague task takes away from other tasks. Obtaining clarification may help you organize your thoughts and identify the information you require to complete it.  Therefore, ask the requestor for clarification so that you can focus on completing the task.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n Seeking clarification can backfire. This depends on the personality of the person who gives you the task and, in some cases, their power and authority. If the person giving a task believes you should know how to complete it, rather than gaining additional information to perform the task you will irritate them and perhaps lose their trust in your competence.\n     Examples  Batch the Simple Stuff  You have many tasks to complete and a number of them are relatively small. The tasks relate to each other. You have a sense that you are not making much progress and you have a block of time to invest in completing small, simple tasks.\n[Negative]\n If too much time is spent clearing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. The priority of small tasks may not let you batch them together. Small tasks may require input from others and not lend themselves to batching. Many small tasks can be similar to (or more complex than) a large task.  [Positive]\n Smaller tasks take less time to complete. Removing things from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Grouping similar small tasks into task groups may reduce the amount of total time required to complete them.  Therefore, when faced with many small tasks, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and an available block of time, batch these tasks together.\n   Commentary     Resulting Context\n Perhaps the most harmful alternative resulting context for this pattern is if you decide to batch simple stuff instead of completing larger and more important tasks. Though you may gain some satisfaction in completing these smaller items, when a task is unimportant, you should consider using a Task Jar instead.\n     Examples  Task Jar  You have many tasks to complete and some of them are relatively small, well known, and not urgent. You also have several larger tasks, which require larger blocks of time or are complex. You do not have a block of time to complete these small tasks, but there is time available between other more important or larger tasks.\n[Negatives]\n If you dedicate too much time to completing small tasks, large tasks may suffer. Stopping large tasks to complete other smaller tasks can cause both to take longer. Simpler tasks may take more time than is available between larger or more complex  tasks.\n[Positives]\n Small tasks do not take a long time to complete. Removing items from your list of things to do gives you a sense of accomplishment. Using the time between tasks to complete other tasks can free your mind temporarily before you begin the next larger or more complex task. There is no advantage to doing small tasks together that do not have any affinity.  Therefore, when faced with many small non-urgent tasks that do not have any affinity, the need to feel a sense of accomplishment, and no dedicated block of time to complete them, intersperse simple tasks throughout the day in between larger or more complex tasks.\n    Commentary\n Tasks should be well known; no need to Seek Clarification Related:  Batch the Simple Stuff Drop Unimportant Tasks         Resulting Context\n Using a \u0026ldquo;task jar\u0026rdquo; allows you to intersperse small, well-known, non-urgent tasks between larger or more complex tasks.\n     Examples  Strike When You Are Hot  You have a task to do and need to progress through it quickly or make significant progress. You have times of the day when you feel you are more productive – times when you are at your intellectual, emotional, or physical best. To make significant progress or complete the task, you feel that you need to be at your best to maintain your focus..\n[Negatives]\n Other tasks or outside influences may interfere with your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time. \u0026ldquo;Hot\u0026rdquo; times can occur at bizarre hours (e.g. in the middle of the night) which, if used, can affect your performance afterward. Using your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time to complete small tasks may or may not be the best use of that time. You may not be able to control the schedule of a task so that you complete it when you are hot. Just because you are at your mental best does not mean you will be able to concentrate. You may not know when your \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; time is.  [Positives]\n Everyone has a time of day where they are at their intellectual, emotional, and physical best. Completing tasks when you are at your best can reduce the amount of time it takes to complete it. When you are at your best, you may be more efficient.  Therefore, when you have a need to move quickly through many smaller tasks or make significant progress on larger tasks, take advantage of the time of day when you are most productive by striking when you are hot.\n    Commentary\n This pattern has its basis in our human biology. People seem to have times of day (not all the same) that they are better at completing tasks than others. For some, it is several different times a day. It has been suggested that the frequency could be as much as every 90-110 minutes. The circadian rhythm is another such biological clock.\n     Resulting Context    Examples  Feedback Loop Related: Agile\n You have a task and are unable to determine how long it will take to complete. You have the information you need to begin the task, but you believe there will be additional information requirements that may emerge as you perform the task. The task itself may be vague, but you do not require clarification. You feel that you need some knowledge of the task\u0026rsquo;s parts to determine how long it will take to complete.\n[Negatives]\n Setting a target does not mean you will achieve it. You may not correctly estimate the duration of a task and waste more time having to stop the task and pick it up again after you assess your results. Completing a portion of the task may not give you any information about other pieces of the task. Unknown duration tasks can be disconcerting.  [Positives]\n It is often easier to break tasks down into sub-tasks. Gathering information about how long it takes you to complete a step can give you valuable information on how long it will take to complete the next step (or the entire task). Completing a task in tight feedback cycles may improve the overall quality of the deliverable.  Therefore, when you are uncertain how long a task is going to take, set a target for how much you expect to complete by a certain time. By setting a target, you will give yourself a point in time where you can check your progress. When you reach the target, you can check the amount of work you completed and then adjust your timeline to reflect how long you are taking.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Prioritize Related: Drop Unimportant Tasks\n You have many tasks to complete. These tasks can be large and complex or small and simple. You have the information you need to decide which tasks are more important. Each task has a different level of importance to you or someone for whom you are completing it.\n[Negatives]\n Sometimes, seemingly unimportant tasks are important. Often tasks originate from many different people. It is difficult to obtain general agreement from them about the relative important of all of your tasks. You have to be the judge. Sometimes the relationship between someone else\u0026rsquo;s goals and a task you are completing is not obvious. Prioritizing your work may cause you to focus on things you think are important versus what others think are important.  [Positives]\n A task\u0026rsquo;s level of importance is somewhat dependent upon its proximity to completion (when it is due). Tasks typically have different levels of importance. Putting the most important tasks first ensures that high value tasks are given more attention than low value tasks.  Therefore, when you have several tasks with different levels of importance, prioritize the work from the most important task to the least important task. When you prioritize tasks, consider the importance of the person requesting the task; the due date of the task; the amount of time required to do the task; the relationship between the task and your goals; and the relationship between the task and the requestor\u0026rsquo;s goals. By ordering the tasks, you ensure that you do the most important tasks first.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Delegate  You have a task to do for which you may not have the specific domain expertise and do not have the time to complete. You have people reporting to you or who are willing to help you complete the task. Others may be able to perform the task equal to or better than you.\n[Negatives]\n People may resent you dumping your work on them. Delegating an important task involves a measure of risk. People may not complete the task within the quality and time parameters you set. However, it may be GOOD ENOUGH. You can spend more time explaining a task to someone than you would spend doing the task yourself.  [Positives]\n You cannot complete everything yourself. People are usually willing to help. When you are busy, you cannot complete every task assigned to you and may need to Drop Unimportant Tasks.  Therefore, when you are faced with a task that you are responsible to complete, but do not have specific domain expertise or time, but either have people reporting to you or have people that do have time, delegate the task. Never put off for tomorrow what you can have someone else do today.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Drop Unimportant Tasks  You have several tasks you need to complete. Some of these tasks are unimportant and may never need action. The task may have been on the bottom of your list of things to do for a very long time and may no longer be required. In addition, you may have had past experience with the requestor and can judge whether it is truly required or not.\n[Negatives]\n History is not always a guide as to whether someone will need the results of a task. Tasks that are unimportant to you may be very important to someone else. A seemingly unimportant task may be a test to see if you can handle more important tasks.  [Positives]\n Understanding busywork is an important component to determining whether to drop a task. Some tasks are just not worth doing (so do not do them).  Therefore, when you receive an unimportant task whose completion will make no difference to anyone, drop the task. This is not an opportunity for slacking. Use this when you are overwhelmed and you are sure that the task will make no difference to anyone. This often requires very detailed knowledge of another person\u0026rsquo;s needs.\n   Commentary    Resulting Context    Examples  Good Enough  You have several tasks you need to complete. You know that not everything that you do has to be perfect. You recognize that the level of quality for a task can be reduced, and still satisfy the requestor. You may be spending time on things that add little value.\nThe best is the enemy of the good. (Voltaire, Dictionnaire Philosophique. Women, 1694-1778)\n  You may feel unsettled by not producing your best work.\n  Some people want to produce a perfect product every time.\n  Time spent perfecting something that does not require perfection is time that is lost to completing other tasks.\n  The requestor may expect perfect output even if the task does not warrant it.\n  Therefore, reduce the level of quality to a level that will satisfy the requestor and meet their expectations. You can then complete the task more quickly. That is, you work on the task only until it is good enough.

Programming is your poetry You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune You are a maker. You build things for people to use  We self-select into communities of our peers based on these ideals. We use coded language to express these ideals to our peers.\nI think each group has its own conferences, and its own subreddits. Its own programming languages, heroes and its own villains.\n Notes Programming as applied mathematics   Source code: The source should read like poetry - dense, with very few lines of code needed to express an idea. Once understood, the terse program seems like a beautiful and obvious description of your program. It is more important that the source code is simple than the execution is simple or fast. High level languages are better than low level languages because they let you express your intent more clearly. Execution: How the program is executed by the computer is an implementation detail of the compiler. It is more important that the code is simple than the execution is fast. Correctness: A program is correct if it implements the spec exactly. The best programs use tools like Ada to formally prove correctness. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Beautiful code is more important than beautiful UI.     Most (arguably all) of the modern advancements in programming languages come from people in this camp. If you\u0026rsquo;ve used React to make a website, you should know that the model of immutability and expressing your view as a pure function from data to DOM came from functional programming. Actually, most modern language features are invented by people who think of programming as thought. Years (or decades) later, those features get copied into the more popular languages and get treated as new ideas.\n Programming as hardware hacking   Source code: The code should be clean, but clean code is less important than a clean execution. Low level languages are often better than high level languages because you can be more explicit about what the computer will do when it executes your code. (Thus you have more room to optimize). Execution: How the computer executes your code is paramount. Programming without thinking about execution is just begging for slow performance. Correctness: A program is correct if it runs the way you expect it to run, given normal parameters. Execution elegance is more important than correctness. And if a theoretical issue can\u0026rsquo;t happen in practice due to how the machine works, its not a real bug. A program must be adequately fast to be considered correct. UI: How the code interacts with humans is a separate consideration from its implementation. Its ok to let the constraints of the hardware guide the user experience.     To this community we owe almost all performance improvements in our computers, above and beyond what is demanded by customers. Nobody else cares about performance quite like people who think about the hardware all day. But if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about your computer as a machine, what greater ugliness can you inflict than pointless work?\n Programming as a tool to make things   Source code: The code should be clean, but only because cleaner code is easier to iterate on. Code cleanliness is less important than most other considerations. Execution: The program only has to be fast enough for the users. If you make it even faster, you\u0026rsquo;re taking time away from adding features that people care about more. Correctness: Bugs are bad only in proportion to their impact. The program should act the way the users expect it to act. UI: The UI is more important than anything else. Every other part of the program only exists in service to the user interface.     I think most professional software engineers are in this tribe - which makes sense, because this is the place where it is easiest to make money writing software.\nIn my experience people in this camp are better at community. They seem to be much more positive and encouraging of new members, and willing to help. I guess its because you can tell if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job in the other two camps by simply taking a look yourself. If you make software for other humans, satisfaction comes from making the people around you happy.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel that this place is a touch soulless. Taken to the extreme, this world view doesn\u0026rsquo;t value the beauty in the engineering itself. Although you could probably make the opposite criticism against the other groups - they don\u0026rsquo;t value how their software can impact the world.\n Also see Moloch.\nReferences .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Gentle, Joseph. 2017. “3 Tribes of Programming.” Seph. http://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/.

This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?\nMoloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis' question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?\nAnd Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. \u0026ldquo;Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Goddess answers: \u0026ldquo;What is the matter with that, if it\u0026rsquo;s what you want to do?\u0026rdquo;\nMalaclypse: \u0026ldquo;But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!\u0026rdquo;\nGoddess: \u0026ldquo;Oh. Well, then stop.\u0026rdquo;\nThe implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: \u0026ldquo;Moloch\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful not because it\u0026rsquo;s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn\u0026rsquo;t an agent.\nBostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.\nSo you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don\u0026rsquo;t everyone else will kill you, because if they don\u0026rsquo;t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to \u0026ldquo;everyone agrees to stop doing this at once\u0026rdquo;, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.\n Examples Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma Fish farming story  As a thought experiment, let\u0026rsquo;s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.\nBut each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let\u0026rsquo;s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.\nA thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.\nBut one farmer (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.\nEveryone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he\u0026rsquo;s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.\nOnce four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying \u0026ldquo;Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone\u0026rsquo;s productivity goes down.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…\nA self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.\n Malthusian trap  Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you\u0026rsquo;re one of those rats from The Rats of NIMH).\nYou live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there\u0026rsquo;s not enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.\nA certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back will go extinct within a few generations.\nIn fact, it\u0026rsquo;s not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out, swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.\nIf some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island\u0026rsquo;s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop the cycle will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating anything is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.\nFor a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.\n Capitalism  Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can\u0026rsquo;t, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\n Two-income trap  It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.\nFrom a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get one will be left behind.\n Agriculture II  A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t take it die out. Eventually, everyone\u0026rsquo;s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone\u0026rsquo;s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.\n Reference star wars \u0026ldquo;make the only choice we can\u0026rdquo; choice III  The Apocrypha Discordia says:\n\u0026ldquo;Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to be somewhere else when we reach the sea.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take this random gag 100% literally and see where it leads us.\nWe just analogized the flow of incentives to the flow of a river. The downhill trajectory is appropriate: the traps happen when you find an opportunity to trade off a useful value for greater competitiveness. Once everyone has it, the greater competitiveness brings you no joy – but the value is lost forever. Therefore, each step of the Poor Coordination Polka makes your life worse.\nBut not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move uphill surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons – excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization – plus one good reason – coordination.\n Excess resources  The ocean depths are a horrible place with little light, few resources, and various horrible organisms dedicated to eating or parasitizing one another. But every so often, a whale carcass falls to the bottom of the sea. More food than the organisms that find it could ever possibly want. There\u0026rsquo;s a brief period of miraculous plenty, while the couple of creatures that first encounter the whale feed like kings. Eventually more animals discover the carcass, the faster-breeding animals in the carcass multiply, the whale is gradually consumed, and everyone sighs and goes back to living in a Malthusian death-trap.\n Physical limitations  Imagine a profit-maximizing slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves' productivity dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor – we assume the fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can – but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how mean you can get away with being. Thus, the \u0026ldquo;race to the bottom\u0026rdquo; stops somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits are run into.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo in this case, a race to the bottom where competing plantations become crueler and crueler to their slaves in order to maximize competitiveness is halted by the physical limitation of cruelty not helping after a certain point.\n Utility maximization  We\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking in terms of preserving values versus winning competitions, and expecting optimizing for the latter to destroy the former.\nBut many of the most important competitions / optimization processes in modern civilization are optimizing for human values. You win at capitalism partly by satisfying customers' values. You win at democracy partly by satisfying voters' values.\nSuppose there\u0026rsquo;s a coffee plantation somewhere in Ethiopia that employs Ethiopians to grow coffee beans that get sold to the United States. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s locked in a life-and-death struggle with other coffee plantations and want to throw as many values under the bus as it can to pick up a slight advantage.\nBut it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice quality of coffee produced too much, or else the Americans won\u0026rsquo;t buy it. And it can\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice wages or working conditions too much, or else the Ethiopians won\u0026rsquo;t work there. And in fact, part of its competition-optimization process is finding the best ways to attract workers and customers that it can, as long as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost them too much money. So this is very promising.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember exactly how fragile this beneficial equilibrium is.\nSuppose the coffee plantations discover a toxic pesticide that will increase their yield but make their customers sick. But their customers don\u0026rsquo;t know about the pesticide, and the government hasn\u0026rsquo;t caught up to regulating it yet. Now there\u0026rsquo;s a tiny uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;selling to Americans\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Americans' values\u0026rdquo;, and so of course Americans' values get thrown under the bus.\nOr suppose that there\u0026rsquo;s a baby boom in Ethiopia and suddenly there are five workers competing for each job. Now the company can afford to lower wages and implement cruel working conditions down to whatever the physical limits are. As soon as there\u0026rsquo;s an uncoupling between \u0026ldquo;getting Ethiopians to work here\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;satisfying Ethiopian values\u0026rdquo;, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too good for Ethiopian values either.\nOr suppose someone invents a robot that can pick coffee better and cheaper than a human. The company fires all its laborers and throws them onto the street to die. As soon as the utility of the Ethiopians is no longer necessary for profit, all pressure to maintain it disappears.\nOr suppose that there is some important value that is neither a value of the employees or the customers. Maybe the coffee plantations are on the habitat of a rare tropical bird that environmentalist groups want to protect. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re on the ancestral burial ground of a tribe different from the one the plantation is employing, and they want it respected in some way. Maybe coffee growing contributes to global warming somehow. As long as it\u0026rsquo;s not a value that will prevent the average American from buying from them or the average Ethiopian from working for them, under the bus it goes.\nI know that \u0026ldquo;capitalists sometimes do bad things\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it\u0026rsquo;s not equivalent to \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo;. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they\u0026rsquo;re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter.\n(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very well and people who summarize him as \u0026ldquo;capitalists are greedy\u0026rdquo; are doing him a disservice)\n   And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it\u0026rsquo;s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there\u0026rsquo;s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus.\nFor example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling to do anything about them because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to look \u0026ldquo;soft on crime\u0026rdquo;, and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all over the airwaves as \u0026ldquo;Convict released by Congressman\u0026rsquo;s policies kills family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone claim he deserves reelection?\u0026rdquo;. So even if decreasing prison populations would be good policy – and it is – it will be very difficult to implement.\n(Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the stunned governments!)\n Coordination The opposite of a trap is a garden\n Things are easy to solve from a god\u0026rsquo;s-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse. An intense competition between agents has turned into a garden, with a single gardener dictating where everything should go and removing elements that do not conform to the pattern.\n   [\u0026hellip;] government can easily solve the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races within a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.\nThe two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there\u0026rsquo;s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.\n IV  So I agree with Robin Hanson: This is the dream time. This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and science and philosophy and love can flourish.\nAs technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus' unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.\n Contract Drafting Em\n The last value we have to sacrifice is being anything at all, having the lights on inside. With sufficient technology we will be \u0026ldquo;able\u0026rdquo; to give up even the final spark.\n(Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!)\nEverything the human race has worked for – all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future – might be accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.\n(Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!)\n   We will break our back lifting Moloch to Heaven, but unless something changes it will be his victory and not ours.\n VII  The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.\nAnd the whole point of Bostrom\u0026rsquo;s Superintelligence is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift something to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u0026rsquo;s on our side, it can kill Moloch dead.\nAnd if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to flourish unconstrained by natural law.\n VIII  The Universe is a dark and foreboding place, suspended between alien deities. Cthulhu, Gnon, Moloch, call them what you will.\nSomewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names. In the Kushiel books, his name was Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans.\nThe other gods sit on their dark thrones and think \u0026ldquo;Ha ha, a god who doesn\u0026rsquo;t even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!\u0026rdquo;\nBut somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a surprising number of unfortunate accidents.\nThere are many gods, but this one is ours.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?\nMy answer is: Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.\nHe always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.\nAs long as the offer\u0026rsquo;s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2014. “Meditations On Moloch.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/.

The reasoning behind all these choices is that we want to produce competent capable adults, and solving short term in-the-moment issues, while important, isn\u0026rsquo;t the goal.\n Thoughts Notes Never lie  If kids ask a question and they aren\u0026rsquo;t ready to hear the answer, just tell them that. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to go into every gruesome detail, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to couch your answer at the level you think they\u0026rsquo;ll understand and that you have time for, but they\u0026rsquo;re smarter than you probably think.\n Win the series  Every interaction is a repeated game, and your goal is not to win this one iteration, but to win the series. So if a child is crying because she wants something, even though it feels like a win to give in now (she stops crying which is better for everyone, you haven\u0026rsquo;t really given up much), it\u0026rsquo;s disastrous in the repeated game because she learns that she can get what she wants by crying.\n Never bluff  If you threaten a consequence and don\u0026rsquo;t follow through, they\u0026rsquo;ll figure that out really quickly. Which leads to the following rule: be very careful with threats. If you make them, carry them out; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to carry out the threat, don\u0026rsquo;t make it.\n Praise the process  We\u0026rsquo;re pretty particular in how we praise our kids. We try to use process praise (\u0026ldquo;I like the way you made up a story about all the parts of your drawing\u0026rdquo;), some amount of results praise (\u0026ldquo;That block tower is amazing! It\u0026rsquo;s so tall!\u0026quot;), and virtually zero person praise (\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a good artist/architect.\u0026quot;)\n Answer questions with as much detail as they want  I\u0026rsquo;ve had conversations with the kids about civil rights, affirmative action, religion, communism versus capitalism, consequences for breaking laws, race, sexuality, and so on. Not because I\u0026rsquo;ve set out to teach them that stuff, but because they ask lots of questions and I try to answer them. Kids are mostly concerned with concrete, day-to-day things \u0026ndash; but some of the best interactions come when they are in the right questioning mood, and you definitely want to take advantage of it.\nYou have to be age appropriate \u0026ndash; when talking about where babies come from, I don\u0026rsquo;t talk about penises in vaginas to a 5 year old \u0026ndash; but they can handle a lot more than most adults give them credit for.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Orr, Dave. n.d. “Parenting Rules.” Accessed March 14, 2022. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8gapy2nLy4wysXSGL/parenting-rules.

For instance, Greenwald mentioned a scene in a hospital in which a nurse inflating a blood-pressure cuff originally said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to blow this up.\u0026rdquo; Greenwald recalls: \u0026ldquo;Fred made us redub the line, saying, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to puff this up with some air,\u0026rsquo; because \u0026lsquo;blow it up\u0026rsquo; might sound like there\u0026rsquo;s an explosion, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the kids to cover their ears and miss what would happen next.\u0026rdquo;\nThe show\u0026rsquo;s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn\u0026rsquo;t air. And Rogers\u0026rsquo;s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet \u0026ldquo;to sleep,\u0026rdquo; he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.\nRogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children\u0026rsquo;s minds might go. For instance, in a scene in which an eye doctor uses an ophthalmoscope to peer into his eyes, he made a point of having the doctor clarify that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see Rogers\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. Rogers also wrote a song called \u0026ldquo;You Can Never Go Down the Drain,\u0026rdquo; because he knew that drains were something that, to kids, seemed to exist solely to suck things down.\n(King 2018)\n   In 1977, about a decade into the show\u0026rsquo;s run, Arthur Greenwald and another writer named Barry Head cracked open a bottle of scotch while on a break, and coined the term Freddish. They later created an illustrated manual called \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Talk About Freddish,\u0026rdquo; a loving parody of the demanding process of getting all the words just right for Rogers. \u0026ldquo;What Fred understood and was very direct and articulate about was that the inner life of children was deadly serious to them,\u0026rdquo; Greenwald said.\nPer the pamphlet, there were nine steps for translating into Freddish:\n \u0026ldquo;State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms preschoolers can understand.\u0026rdquo; Example: It is dangerous to play in the street. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase in a positive manner,\u0026rdquo; as in It is good to play where it is safe. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.\u0026rdquo; As in, \u0026ldquo;Ask your parents where it is safe to play.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive.\u0026rdquo; In the example, that\u0026rsquo;d mean getting rid of \u0026ldquo;ask\u0026rdquo;: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;d be \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo;: Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.\u0026rdquo; Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. \u0026ldquo;Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow your advice.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; represents a value judgment, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them. \u0026ldquo;Rephrase your idea a ﬁnal time, relating it to some phase of development a preschooler can understand.\u0026rdquo; Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play.

The way of organizing global society described here could be a north star for humanity over the next 200-500 years as we grow into post-scarcity.\nBlack proposes converting work to play. I wonder: will all games have players?\n Even if we assume that all work could be gamified, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that everyone will want to play such games. I love games, and have spent way too much of my life playing them, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gone months and years without playing any games at all, and don\u0026rsquo;t see how being forced to play a game would be any better than being forced to work.\nAlso, its difficult to imagine how the most undesirable of jobs could be gamified. Who\u0026rsquo;s going to want to play the garbageman game? Or the fix the sewage system game?\nThe products and services of our modern world also requires sustained, multi-year efforts by trained specialists. Something like the mass production of medicine isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can just play with once in a while and still get it made in high enough quantities with serious quality control.\n(pmoriarty n.d.)\n Perhaps the answer is just more automation.\nNotes  The alternative to work isn\u0026rsquo;t just idleness. To be ludic is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it\u0026rsquo;s never more rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called \u0026ldquo;leisure\u0026rdquo;; far from it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.\n The Carrot is the Stick\n Many workers are fed up with work. There are high and rising rates of absenteeism, turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread among workers themselves is that work itself is inevitable and necessary.\nI disagree. It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand — and I think this is the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure — we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make them less enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.\n   Under a system of permanent revelry, we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put the Renaissance to shame. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any more jobs, just things to do and people to do them.\n   Bear in mind that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take today\u0026rsquo;s work just as we find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would have to be perverse indeed. If technology has a role in all this it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new realms for re/creation.\n   Workers of the world\u0026hellip; relax!\n   Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren\u0026rsquo;t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.\nAnd so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Black, Bob. n.d. “The Abolition of Work.” The Anarchist Library.

A substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too expensive. Chicken is a substitute for beef. If you\u0026rsquo;re a chicken farmer and the price of beef goes up, the people will want more chicken, and you will sell more.\nA complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems. And babysitters are a complement of dinner at fine restaurants.\n(Spolsky 2002)\n   All else being equal, demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease.\n(Spolsky 2002)\n   Any product is the joint outcome of a large number of individual components, each of which layers is necessary but not sufficient to the final valuable use of the entire stack put together; a smartphone is not much good without a power-efficient sensitive radio, but the radio is not much good without a good OS on top of it, and a good OS is not much good either without great apps like web browsers (and is a web browser all that useful if there aren\u0026rsquo;t useful websites to use in it, and where are the languages \u0026amp; compilers for all this coming from anyway…?).\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Another way that I like to express that is \u0026ldquo;create a desert of profitability around you\u0026rdquo;. I once had a strategy professor define the Google business model somewhat like that, where \u0026ldquo;Google tries to make every other business around it free or irrelevant\u0026rdquo;…A desert of profitability shifts consumers to you, and keeps competitors away.\n(Branwen 2018)\n   Vertical integration can be an effective way of resolving the intractable market dispute with top-down dictatorships, but can require lax anti-monopoly regulations, high capital investment, massive corporation overextension \u0026amp; empire-building, and risks being outcompeted at every level by nimbler competitors; this makes it difficult for any up-and-coming company to implement, and often ineffective. Commoditizing the complements, in contrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small \u0026amp; lean, can often be accomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual property or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific layers without the \u0026ldquo;Big Bang\u0026rdquo; orientation of vertical integration and permitting \u0026ldquo;defeat in detail\u0026rdquo;, retains the general facade of competition, and ensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack where the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but is not itself at any risk.\nIn practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market dynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging competitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits \u0026amp; software patent trolling, proprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate incompatibility or \u0026ldquo;embrace and extend\u0026rdquo;, FUD, operating at a loss indefinitely, etc. (\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s An App For That\u0026rdquo; is why you buy an iPhone—but it\u0026rsquo;s Apple with the $930 billion market cap \u0026amp; not the app developers.)\nDone correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents' long-term control of markets \u0026amp; justifies their enormous valuations—by definition, the competitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too numerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening R\u0026amp;D4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be relatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor does this require convoluted explanations like \u0026ldquo;they are pretending to not be monopolists\u0026rdquo; or fully general unfalsifiable claims like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s good PR\u0026rdquo; for why big companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects like new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts \u0026amp; TrueType itself) or open source TCP/​IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly profitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable—but do have clear explanations in terms of business objectives like \u0026ldquo;driving more mobile web browsing\u0026rdquo; (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement, mobile web browsing, has become cheaper/​easier). I wonder if this also explains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes—as entities get worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but was formerly considered \u0026lsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; or because they assume the other entity knows something they don\u0026rsquo;t.

I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that\u0026rsquo;s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.\n   In short, if you\u0026rsquo;re in search of generalizable knowledge that compounds exponentially over time, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they\u0026rsquo;re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.\nBut for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. Computers can be understood—even if it\u0026rsquo;s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\n   The most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through pip install first.\u0026quot; If you know how Git\u0026rsquo;s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.\n   Blub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you\u0026rsquo;re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system\u0026rsquo;s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles [Learn things with a long shelf-life].\n   Once, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used user.name (the name field of an object stored in the user variable) instead of User.name (the name field of the class User) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; by which User.name was an instance of Column while user.name was a simple str. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python\u0026rsquo;s descriptor protocol to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked\u0026mdash;and I realized that Python\u0026rsquo;s __dunder__ methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIf you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to look things up to figure out how they\u0026rsquo;re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;declarative\u0026rdquo; ORM works under the hood. That\u0026rsquo;s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you\u0026rsquo;ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.\n   Because of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your \u0026ldquo;blub flywheel\u0026rdquo;—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I\u0026rsquo;m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to go deeper than necessary. If I really want to ship something, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out why that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I\u0026rsquo;ll bias against \u0026ldquo;guess-and-check\u0026rdquo; style debugging in favor of getting a better understanding of the system I\u0026rsquo;m trying to debug. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always feel worth it to, e.g., dive into the docs of tcpdump and iptables rules to track down my weird one-off networking issue—but over time I\u0026rsquo;ve run into enough \u0026ldquo;weird one-off networking issues\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s paid off many times over.\nThe second part of my blub flywheel is to pay attention to magic. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;m working with something new, I try to continuously update my best-guess mental model of how it\u0026rsquo;s implemented. \u0026ldquo;Okay, the docs are telling me to create an Ingress, I guess this is probably the widget that provisions a load balancer to talk to my backend containers?\u0026rdquo; If I realize I\u0026rsquo;m wrong, I\u0026rsquo;ll dig in and update. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I can\u0026rsquo;t ping those pods from outside the cluster, so how could the load balancer be talking to them? Aha—it\u0026rsquo;s talking to the nodes, and there\u0026rsquo;s a NodePort Service as a second layer of indirection.\u0026rdquo; If I have no idea at all how something could work, that usually means it\u0026rsquo;s time to read a book.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Kuhn, Ben. n.d. “In Defense of Blub Studies.” Benkuhn.Net.

There is no layer beyond which we leave the realm of logic and executing instructions and encounter unknowable demons making arbitrary and capricious decisions. Most behaviors in one layer are comprehensible in terms of the concepts of the next layer, and all behaviors can be understood by digging down through enough layers.\n   My advice for a practical upshot from this post would be: cultivate a deep sense of curiosity about the systems you work with.

The question was, \u0026ldquo;How do we get it back?\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to a CompUSA on the east-coast, you\u0026rsquo;ll soon realize that they are PC-centric and the Macs are nearly non-existent. We only brought it there because it was so close and, gosh, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Apple have some way to certify that a CompUSA has qualified repair people and a good stash of spares before it would list that particular location? I mean, this is Apple, right? The best quality around? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that quality extend to their partners?\nSo my co-worker went to the CompUSA and asked if the repair was done. The guy went to the back room, then came out. \u0026ldquo;Nope.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case, I want it back.\u0026rdquo;\nThe repair person got very defensive. \u0026ldquo;Why do you want it back? It\u0026rsquo;s not working! What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\nMy co-worker, in a shining moment of brilliance realized that any kind of full disclosure would only result in an unproductive battle over the iMac that he could easily lose: possession is 9/10th of the law.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s taking too long\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;d have to defend the assertion against a barrage of, \u0026ldquo;But we promise it will be only one more day\u0026rdquo; and other excuses.\nIf he answers, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m taking it to your competitor\u0026rdquo; then he\u0026rsquo;d have to suffer through someone defending his company\u0026rsquo;s honor (and profits) to defeat the request.\nBeing too honest wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help either. Saying \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re incompetent and I want to take it somewhere that isn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help the situation. There\u0026rsquo;s no cheese down that hole.\nThen he came up with the perfect answer: He shrugged his shoulders and said, \u0026ldquo;My boss wants it back.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the perfect answer. You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with it.\nIt can be said that the most effective communication is that that speaks in the audience\u0026rsquo;s terms. His answer said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a lacky just like you. Your boss is a jerk and gives you shit jobs to do, and I my boss is a jerk and gives me shit jobs. I\u0026rsquo;m just like you. Please, in the brotherhood of underpaid-lackeys-with-mean-bosses, just give it to me.\u0026rdquo;\nIt harkening back to mommy and daddy leaving you speechless as a child being told \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t have that candy because I said so\u0026rdquo; it disarms him. It turns the biggest repair shop bully into a crying, defenseless child.\nIt ends the argument because it says, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t argue with me, I\u0026rsquo;m the messenger.\u0026rdquo;\nThe name for this technique is \u0026ldquo;playing dumb.\u0026rdquo; It is a technique that we geeks often forget. We geeks are smart. We get paid for being smart. We get paid for having all the answers. Someone once told me, \u0026ldquo;My value to the company is to be the guy that knows everything.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s us. We\u0026rsquo;re the smart people. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to not give a well-reasoned answer even when it won\u0026rsquo;t work.\n\u0026ldquo;My boss said so.\u0026rdquo; Short. Simple. It works.\nThe important thing is that we play dumb. You have to be pretty smart to do that.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Limoncelli, Tom. n.d. “The Right Answer.” Accessed February 21, 2022. https://everythingsysadmin.com/2004/12/the-right-answer.html.

As it\u0026rsquo;s been said elsewhere, they \u0026ldquo;beg for the bad news.\u0026rdquo;\n Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived  Being able to write a Bloom Filter in Erlang, or write multi-threaded C in your sleep is insufficient. None of that matters if no one wants to work with you. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one wants to work alongside them because they are assholes. Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and ego-boosting behavior send the message to other engineers (maybe tacitly) to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things. An engineer who is quick to call someone a moron is someone destined to stunt his or her career.\nThis also means that mature engineers have self-awareness when it comes to their communication. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer communicates perfectly, only that they have some notion about where they could be better, and continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how they\u0026rsquo;re doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it elsewhere, but I must emphasize the point more: the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.\n Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it  Avoiding responsibility for estimates is another way of saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure.\u0026rdquo; All businesses rely on estimates, and all engineers working on a project are involved in Joint Activity, which means that they have a responsibility to others to make themselves interpredictable. In general, mature engineers are comfortable with working within some nonzero amount of uncertainty and risk.\n Mature engineers have an innate sense of anticipation, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know they do  This code looks good, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked other people to review it, and I\u0026rsquo;ve taken their feedback. Now: how long will it last before it\u0026rsquo;s rewritten? Once it\u0026rsquo;s in production, how will its execution affect resource usage? How much do I expect CPU/memory/disk/network to increase or decrease? Will others be able to understand this code? Am I making it as easy as I can for others to extend or introspect this work?\n Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work  Getting things done means doing things you might not be interested in. No matter how exciting or appealing a project is, there are always boring tasks. Tedious tasks. Tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title.\n Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them  They recognize that at some point, their individual contribution and potential cannot be exercised singularly. They recognize that there is only so much that can be produced by a single person, and the world\u0026rsquo;s best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers.\n Mature engineers understand the difference between mentorship and sponsorship, and develop a habit of the latter Allspaw distinguishes between \u0026ldquo;mentorship\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sponsorship\u0026rdquo;:\n Mentors Face Inward Sponsors Face Outward   Engineers who find that the visibility of their own work is increasing acknowledge that a fundamental of wielding influence in your local community (both inside and outside your organization) is developing and maintaining awareness of opportunities to sponsor those around them that would benefit. It is not a secret that the tech industry is seriously challenged when it comes to supporting underrepresented and/or marginalized groups.\nDeveloping this as a habit takes effort, but the benefits are multi-fold; the engineer sharpens their critical-thinking skills (\u0026ldquo;oh, what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about in this meeting would be a great opportunity for $NAME to work on…\u0026quot;) and the sponsored engineer has opportunities that they otherwise might not.\n   [\u0026hellip;] this instinct to mentor plays into the idea that those who are marginalized aren\u0026rsquo;t already skilled enough, smart enough, or ready for more responsibility or leadership.\nWhat members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice. They have to work extremely hard and be extremely good at what they do to combat the systemic privilege and unconscious bias at play in our work environments. They are consistently under-promoted and under-compensated for this work, even though it\u0026rsquo;s excellent work.\n Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions  They realize all engineering decisions, implementations, and designs exist within a spectrum; we do not live in a binary world. They can quickly point out contexts where one successful approach or solution could work and where it could not. They know that one cannot be both efficient and thorough at the same time (The ETTO Principle), that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.\nThey know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and are OK with that. They are comfortable with it because they strive to make the ideal and non-ideal in a design explicit. Later on in the lifecycle of a design, when the original design is not scaling anymore or needs to be replaced or rewritten, they can look back not with a perspective of how short-sighted those earlier decisions were, but instead say \u0026ldquo;yep, we made it this far with it and knew we\u0026rsquo;d have to extend or change it at some point. Looks like that time is now, let\u0026rsquo;s get to work!\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip;]\n   The tl;dr on trade-offs is that everyone cuts corners, in every project. Immature engineers discover them in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them and recognize them as part of good engineering.\n Mature engineers don\u0026rsquo;t practice CYAE (\u0026ldquo;Cover Your Ass Engineering\u0026rdquo;)  An example of CYAE is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not my fault. They broke it, they used it wrong. I built it to spec, I can\u0026rsquo;t be held responsible for their mistakes or improper specification.\u0026rdquo;\n I disagree with this point. I consider a lot of the documentation and design work that a mature engineer does to be under the heading of CYA. I agree that mature engineers won\u0026rsquo;t seek to throw others under the bus. However, I also expect mature engineers to understand that others may not play by the same rules. I expect a mature engineer to, at least to some extent, play the game.\nMature engineers are empathetic  In complex projects, there are usually a number of stakeholders. In any project, the designers, product managers, operations engineers, developers, and business development folks all have goals and perspectives, and mature engineers realize that those goals and views may be different. They understand this so that they can navigate effectively in the work that they do. Being empathetic in this sense means having the ability to view the project from another person\u0026rsquo;s perspective and to take that into consideration into your own work.\n Mature engineers make grounded complaints  [\u0026hellip;] they express judgments based on empirical evidence and bring with those judgments options for solving the problem which they\u0026rsquo;ve identified. A great manager of mine said to never go to your boss with a complaint about anything without at least one (ideally more than one) suggestion for a solution. Even demonstrating that you\u0026rsquo;ve tried working the problem on your own and came up empty-handed is better than an empty complaint.\n Mature engineers are aware of cognitive biases  This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that every mature engineer needs to have a degree in psychology, but cognitive biases are what can limit the growth of an engineer\u0026rsquo;s career at a certain point. Even if they\u0026rsquo;re not aware of the details of how they appear or how these biases can be guarded against, most mature engineers I know have a level of self-awareness to at least recognize they (like everyone) are susceptible to them.\n The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming  Appropriate, even if old\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it referenced as coming from The Psychology of Computer Programming, written in 1971, but I don\u0026rsquo;t actually see it in the text. Regardless, here are The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming, found on @wyattdanger\u0026rsquo;s blog post on receiving advice from his dad:\n Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them early before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at JPL, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry. We can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on. You are not your code. Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found. Don\u0026rsquo;t take it personally when one is uncovered. (Allspaw note \u0026ndash; related: see below, number #10, and the points Theo made above.) No matter how much \u0026ldquo;karate\u0026rdquo; you know, someone else will always know more. Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it\u0026rsquo;s not needed. Don\u0026rsquo;t rewrite code without consultation. There\u0026rsquo;s a fine line between \u0026ldquo;fixing code\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rewriting code.\u0026rdquo; Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience. Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don\u0026rsquo;t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position. Knowledge engenders authority, and authority engenders respect \u0026ndash; so if you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat. Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don\u0026rsquo;t take revenge or say \u0026ldquo;I told you so.\u0026rdquo; Never make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry. Don\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026ldquo;the coder in the corner.\u0026quot; Don\u0026rsquo;t be the person in the dark office emerging only for soda. The coder in the corner is out of sight, out of touch, and out of control. This person has no voice in an open, collaborative environment. Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community. Critique code instead of people \u0026ndash; be kind to the coder, not to the code. As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc.   References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Allspaw, John. n.d. “On Being A Senior Engineer.” Kitchen Soap.

Often, \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company\u0026rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.\n   Where possible, solving the general form of any problem is preferable to solving a single instance. However, this is only possible if the problem space is well understood. Premature abstraction, in code or elsewhere, introduces risk. If the failure modes in production are poorly understood, volunteering for pager duty may be the only way to really help.\n   Most risks, especially where managed effectively, never come to pass. For this reason, it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to tell the difference between real risk and perceived risk. By the same token, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real impact and perceived impact. If a senior engineer identifies a significant risk, they have to be able to concisely explain and prioritize it for a non-expert audience.\n   Every company has different risks, and so every company expects something different from their senior engineers. An engineer who has spent the last five years making small, continuous improvements to the processes in a larger company may not enjoy or even understand the sort of role expected by a three person startup. The expectation that \u0026ldquo;senior\u0026rdquo; is a fungible title is both widespread and harmful, leading to unrealistic expectations from both engineers and companies.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Senior Engineers Reduce Risk.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/senior-engineers-reduce-risk.html.

My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore. His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.\nI recognized that he had a tendency towards self-aggrandizement and awkward flattery of his readers, but at worst he seemed harmless. As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.\nRecently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore. He\u0026rsquo;s written about the need to defend \u0026ldquo;moderates\u0026rdquo; from bullies on the \u0026ldquo;extreme left\u0026rdquo;, asserted that \u0026ldquo;the truth is to the right of the median\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;the left is culturally dominant,\u0026rdquo; and justified Coinbase\u0026rsquo;s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed \u0026ldquo;political\u0026rdquo; by saying that it \u0026ldquo;will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.\u0026rdquo;\nI went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something. It turned out that I had. There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design. In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut Graham\u0026rsquo;s analysis of brevity, and indeed of all language design, was fundamentally unserious. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in a rigorous definition of brevity, because the ultimate measure of a language\u0026rsquo;s quality was still his hacker\u0026rsquo;s radar. All of his essays, and Arc itself, were just spokes around that central hub. If his essays sometimes disagreed, or if Arc didn\u0026rsquo;t reflect his essays, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly surprising; their only connection was they all, in the moment, seemed right and true to Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMichael Polanyi coined the term \u0026ldquo;Tacit knowledge\u0026rdquo; to describe something we only understand as part of something else. When we speak, for instance, we don\u0026rsquo;t focus on the sounds we\u0026rsquo;re making, we focus on our words. We understand how to speak, but would struggle to explain it. Tacit knowledge comprises the vast majority of what we know; we rely on it constantly.\nWhen that knowledge begins to lead us astray, however, Polanyi tells us we that must delve into it. We must make it explicit [Make implicit knowledge explicit]. An explicit understanding of speech might be necessary for someone with a speech impediment, but also for a professional performer; to be at the top of your field, it\u0026rsquo;s almost always necessary to transform innate talent into something more.\nA rare exception to this rule is the chicken sexer, who can quickly and accurately determine whether a day-old chick is male or female. The two are indistinguishable to most, but an expert can classify a thousand chicks an hour with 98% accuracy. The knowledge underpinning this expertise has never been made explicit; a trainee is simply corrected by an expert, over and over, until their intuition is equally refined.\nHeld to this standard, however, we all fall short. No one\u0026rsquo;s sensibilities about software design are so refined that they can teach simply through demonstration. We have to distill our intuition down to principles, and let those principles guide us beyond the bounds of our intuition. Anything less is just rentier pedagogy; maxims stripped of any context, whose true meaning within a given situation can only be judged by a single person.\nThis is the essence of modern \u0026ldquo;thought leadership\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s served Graham well. His essays on language design, as well as a few on startups, brought in the first entrepreneurs to his fledgling VC fund. People applied to YCombinator because they wanted Graham to apply his intuition to their problems.\nGraham\u0026rsquo;s essays on startups were much the same as his essays on language design, but they served a different purpose. They were marketing content, and in that role they excelled. They tantalized the reader by reducing complex problems down to singular, nebulous concepts. They hinted at deep insights that were just out of reach. They made people want to be in the same room as Paul Graham.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA recurring theme in his essays, both before and after his time at YCombinator, is conformity. Graham is resolutely on the side of the non-conformist, repeatedly tracing their lineage back to Galileo\u0026rsquo;s insistence that the earth moves, even after the church had forced him to recant.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nGraham writes \u0026ldquo;the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \u0026lsquo;Eppur si muove,\u0026rdquo; but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t pause to consider that it is also \u0026ldquo;EARTH HAS 4 CORNER SIMULTANEOUS 4-DAY TIME CUBE\u0026rdquo; and, more worryingly, \u0026ldquo;Jews will not replace us\u0026rdquo;. His model exists largely so he can focus on the one quadrant he finds interesting, but even that is a proxy for a much smaller group, the moral and intellectual heirs of Galileo, the people he intuits to be his peers. Graham doesn\u0026rsquo;t work through the consequences of his own model because the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter; what matters is sharing some things that feel right and true.\nThis is all to say that Paul Graham is an effective marketer and practitioner, but a profoundly unserious public intellectual. His attempts to grapple with the major issues of the present, especially as they intersect with his personal legacy, are so mired in intuition and incuriosity that they\u0026rsquo;re at best a distraction, and worst a real obstacle to understanding our paths forward.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Tellman, Zach. n.d. “Thought Leaders and Chicken Sexers.” Accessed February 19, 2022. https://ideolalia.com/essays/thought-leaders-and-chicken-sexers.html.

You might spend an hour writing a careful reply, capturing your latest thinking. And now\u0026hellip; it lives in your \u0026ldquo;sent\u0026rdquo; folder, and briefly in the impression on your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s mind. The effort accumulates only insofar as that work subtly influences your and your colleague\u0026rsquo;s thinking over time.\nLikewise, Most people take only transient notes, though with effective practices, they\u0026rsquo;re an essential foundation; see Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.\nWe should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time.\nA Spaced repetition memory system achieves this for memory: when you find information useful, you can invest a little effort to make sure you always have it available. Over time, one\u0026rsquo;s spaced repetition library accumulates thousands of questions, and (I strongly suspect) that knowledge makes it easier to be an effective knowledge worker later.\nHamming illustrates this point vividly:\n\u0026ldquo;You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode\u0026rsquo;s office and said, \u0026ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?\u0026rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \u0026ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.\u0026rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!\nWhat Bode was saying was this: \u0026ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.\u0026rdquo; [Do things that compound] Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode\u0026rsquo;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.\u0026rdquo;\n Extract links into notes References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Matuschak, Andy. n.d. “Knowledge Work Should Accrete.” Andy’s Working Notes.

The goal for this writing session is only to get them down and out of my head. They are listed in no particular order.\n Only work on things that matter. Things that matter can be defended and argued to others; ideally with hard numbers. Be cautious about investing into projects that cannot be argued with numbers. Taking a closer look at the numbers around search keyboard usage may have led me to invest less in a technically complex keyboard solution (Kabu). Verify assumptions/expectations as early as possible. Get an experiment out there to confirm the things you think will happen as soon as possible. What is the minimum viable product? Build that and send it out. Confirm, with numbers, that the thing you want to build is worth building. Write your assumptions down throughout the duration of the project, especially at the beginning, and track them. How and when will you test them? Under promise and over deliver. Pad estimates. Be cautious when agreeing to deadlines. The unexpected always happens. Break projects down. Then break them down more. Trim all of the fat and get to MVP as soon as you can. From there, ensure steady and meaningful deliverables. Coding should be more typing than thinking. Design a solution away from the computer, then return and type it up. Document everything. Specifically, document what you do and the status of your projects. You\u0026rsquo;ll forget more than you ever know so write it down. I have come to like this process: write down the important things you do on a daily basis, summarize those at the end of the week, summarize those every month. Then, in addition to those notes, keep a set of notes specific to each project you\u0026rsquo;re working on. These project notes should include an up-to-date-at-all-times timeline of events and should include references to everything related to the project. This is more than you would ever send to someone but that\u0026rsquo;s not what it is for. This document is the bible for the project. It\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll pull from whenever you\u0026rsquo;re asked any question about the project from now until the end of time. Put time on your calendar to keep these documents up to date. Communicate regularly with stakeholders. Keep in mind that your audience dictates the way you present information. I\u0026rsquo;ve found through trial and error that a bi-weekly update is sufficient for most projects. More often than that and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to make meaningful progress enough to make the update worthwhile to write. That said, it may be useful to send something brief to your immediate team every week, or update them in a meeting. Communicate delays or other changes to the plan as early as possible.  Taken from my Keep notepad:\n Reach out to other teams before your invest time and effort to be sure they haven\u0026rsquo;t already fixed the problem Find a single point of contact (tl, etc) on collaborating teams. Send them docs for easily review. Proactively communicate. It\u0026rsquo;s your job to surface things and ask questions, it\u0026rsquo;s not their job to think of your questions for you. Or, rather, you can\u0026rsquo;t assume they will do you should act like they won\u0026rsquo;t. Don\u0026rsquo;t enter into a project without a good understanding of the benefits in a numeric sense. Kabu is, potentially, a massive 5 quarter long project which will introduce additional download times for our users and provide little in tangible benefits. Communicate especially when you feel too stressed to communicate. Take notes and document especially when you feel like there\u0026rsquo;s no time to. Adhere to all the good engineering habits especially when you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ll get them first thing on Monday when you get back. When feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to go for a quick walk and when you\u0026rsquo;re done with the walk write down the things that need to be done. Now that it certain down, does it feel as overwhelming? Is there any way to shorten the list by making concessions or cutting features? Can you reach out to anybody on the team to help you prioritize the list?  Taken from another Keep note:\n How much mayonnaise is in the jar? Meaning, to borrow another saying, how large is the market. The same hour of effort has different results based on the project it\u0026rsquo;s applied to. Understand what the payout stands to be for anything you\u0026rsquo;re working on. Think about your project from the perspective of an l7 who couldn\u0026rsquo;t give less of a shit. Can you convince them, with something concrete, to give a shit about the project? Rapid iteration beats coding in a tower for 6 months. Get to experiment quickly with a hack to prove that the real version is worth the effort. Think metrics first. Write up a step by step guide to evaluating projects and working on them. Include this shit so I won\u0026rsquo;t forget it again.  Taken from a Keep note:\n Thoroughly reviewing existing code when coming into extend an existing project. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s bug free. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume it\u0026rsquo;s written well. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume the engineers who wrote it adhered to best practices or designed it in an extensible way. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume there are tests of any kind (unit, integration, end-to-end).  Prioritize Deep work\nI realized when writing this that the whole lot of it is the same as what\u0026rsquo;s posted all over the internet. The only difference is that these words mean more to me because I bled to learn them. It makes me wonder how much value there really is in seeking out advice online.\n2019-08-20\n Only work on things that have buy in from L+1, ideally L+2 or L+3. Things that higher ups are going to be judged against are going to be the things that they are motivated to invest in. Ideally, they\u0026rsquo;re success should depend on your success. This will ensure they make sure you succeed without you needing to do extra maneuvering. I cannot work in a silo for too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely weary of letting it run too long.

It overlaps well with my own Style Guide.\nNotes Introduction  Why write nonfiction?\n[\u0026hellip;]\n  Gain leverage\nKeeping thoughts to yourself can be a disservice to the world. If you have something important to say and you say it well, you send strangers down paths badly needed.\nWriting is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch.\n  Clarity of thought\nWriting is a laxative for the mind. When you write, your brain can\u0026rsquo;t stop itself from drawing connections between ideas—and exploring their implications. This shines a light on broken logic, which helps you gain clarity of thought.\nWriting is the act of thinking clearly with the help of paper. Writing slows down your thinking so you can play with your ideas.\n  Human connection\nThe most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet.\nIf you do interesting things then write about them publicly with an authentic voice, like-minded people want to meet the person behind that voice. Writing is a bat signal for your people.\n  (Shapiro n.d.-a), formatting mine\n What to Write About Choose your topic  A novel idea is one that\u0026rsquo;s not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and worthwhile. I\u0026rsquo;ve identified five categories:\n Counter-intuitive — \u0026ldquo;Oh, I never realized the world worked that way.\u0026rdquo; Counter-narrative — \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s not how I was told the world worked!\u0026rdquo; Shock and awe — \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s crazy. I would have never believed it.\u0026rdquo; Elegant articulations — \u0026ldquo;Beautiful. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have said it better myself.\u0026rdquo; Make someone feel seen — \u0026ldquo;Yes! That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I feel!\u0026rdquo;  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n   Your objective clarifies what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish, and your motivation ensures you actually see it through.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all that\u0026rsquo;s needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles.\nIf the right objective and motivation combo isn\u0026rsquo;t coming right away, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what\u0026rsquo;s in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light.\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Write an intro  I define an intro as the minimal information necessary to:\n Introduce the breadth of the post\u0026rsquo;s contents so that readers can decide if it\u0026rsquo;s for them. Hook readers into reading more.  It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how you hook readers, so long as you eventually fulfill the hook.\nA hook is not a gimmick. It\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental psychological principle: A great intro—like an electrifying opening to a film—buys goodwill with readers. Buy enough goodwill and readers look past the weaker parts of your post—because they\u0026rsquo;re chasing the high from your great opening.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA hook is a half-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer:\n Questions — Pose an intriguing question, but don\u0026rsquo;t give the full answer. Narratives — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion. Research — Highlight research findings, but only a small portion. Arguments — Make an unexpected claim, but don\u0026rsquo;t explain how it\u0026rsquo;s true.  Hooks serve two purposes:\n They compel readers to continue reading. They switch on the storytelling machinery in readers' heads. They help you identify what\u0026rsquo;s interesting—novel—to write about.  In a nonfiction essay that explores new ideas, an effective intro often follows this structure:\n Establish shared context. Surface a problem and what\u0026rsquo;s at stake. Explore the problem\u0026rsquo;s significance. Tease a clever solution.  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Combat skepticism  In your intro, consider proactively countering any major skepticisms that exist. There are five types of skepticism to counter:\n  Superficial: Superficial skepticism emerges from readers not believing you\u0026rsquo;ll share things they don\u0026rsquo;t already know.\nSolution: Tease your original insights in your introduction.‍\n  Irrelevant: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll cover key points they care about.\nSolution: List the points you\u0026rsquo;ll cover.‍\n  Sloppy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want to sit through bad writing.\nSolution: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.‍\n  Implausible: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;ll deliver on your hooks.\nSolution: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.\n  Untrustworthy: Readers don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re qualified to write about this.\nSolution: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can\u0026rsquo;t help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they believe you. Or, if you\u0026rsquo;re indeed unqualified, be upfront about it and frame the post as an exploratory journey you\u0026rsquo;re taking them on.\n  If you successfully hook readers while neutralizing their skepticism, you generate goodwill: now they\u0026rsquo;re invested in reading the rest of your post.\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Integrate feedback See also Collaborate for better results.\n My favorite writing trick is to only write my introduction then ask friends who represent my audience this question:\n\u0026ldquo;After reading only this intro, what are the most interesting ideas I could possibly cover in the rest of the post?\u0026rdquo;\nI pick and choose the responses that resonate with me. This is how I de-risk my post from lacking novelty: Am I headed in a direction that\u0026rsquo;s maximally interesting?\n(Shapiro n.d.-d)\n   The elements of a great intro\n[\u0026hellip;]\n It\u0026rsquo;s a compelling hook into your topic. Readers sense forthcoming novelty. It conveys the importance of the idea so that readers want to hear the rest of the story. It twisted the knife enough to help readers feel the pain you\u0026rsquo;re speaking to. It\u0026rsquo;s concise. Readers don\u0026rsquo;t want all the details; they want the minimum needed to be teased by your novelty in a way that resonates.  (Shapiro n.d.-d)\n Writing First Drafts  You\u0026rsquo;re a proxy for your die-hard readers.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the irony of self-indulgent writing: writing for yourself is the quickest path to writing something others love.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   The mistake writers make is believing expertise is required to write compelling nonfiction. Nope, it\u0026rsquo;s the rabid desire to indulge your curiosity.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   When ideas stop flowing, ask yourself:\n How can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said?  (Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced conclusions are necessary. But I like placing them after my resulting points to prompt readers into action. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\n  First, share a poignant takeaway Identify your article\u0026rsquo;s significance by re-reading it and asking, \u0026ldquo;What was this really about? What was I trying to say?\u0026rdquo;\nDistill the answer into a single, punchy sentence. Make readers think, \u0026ldquo;Ahh, yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why this article was profound.\u0026rdquo;\n  Next, provide next steps Now that your wisdom has resonated with readers, ask yourself, What about the world can my readers better appreciate now that they\u0026rsquo;ve read my article?\nShare where they can go next to continue the journey they started here.\n  For a writing guide such as this, I might conclude by sharing bloggers whose work I enjoy. Then I might urge you to reverse engineer their articles and study what makes them great. That\u0026rsquo;s how you continue your learning.\n(Shapiro n.d.-e)\n   While writing, keep these points in mind:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained by your outline. Expect to discover most of your ideas throughout the writing process. Trust that what interests you is what interests your readers. If not, target an audience more like yourself.  (Shapiro n.d.-e)\n Rewriting and Editing  Your favorite authors' first drafts are typically bad too. However, great authors have the discipline to aggressively rewrite their first drafts in pursuit of:\n Being clearly understood Persuasive reasoning Sustaining curiosity Resonance — Story, analogy, and poetry  The enemy of those objectives is being precious about what you originally said and how you originally said it.\nWhen you first write an idea down, you do so in whatever disjointed way immediately came to mind. Rewriting is the art of finding the correct puzzle pieces within that mess and putting them together in the right order.\nIn short, your first draft is to extract novel ideas out of your brain. Your second draft is to rewrite those ideas so they resonate.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Goal: Be understood  I like to write sentences that a thirteen-year-old could follow.\nIf they can understand, so can everyone else—including anyone who\u0026rsquo;s skimming.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say children should understand the details and nuances. Rather, I think children should be able to follow the logic of all your arguments.\nYou already do this intuitively. When speaking to children, you simplify:\n You use plain phrasing. You use fewer ideas per sentence.  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n This reminds me of Freddish, though it\u0026rsquo;s aimed at a much younger audience.\n   Remove abstract phrasing\n Here\u0026rsquo;s a sentence with complex phrasing:\n\u0026ldquo;The obstacle facing media organizations is charting an economically sustainable course through a landscape of commodity journalism.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that plainly:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are struggling to stay in business because anyone with a Twitter account can report the news now. The news has never been more of a commodity than it is today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how you talk to a thirteen-year-old. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how you should talk to everyone all the time.\nIn the revised example, I removed abstract words like \u0026ldquo;charted\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;landscape,\u0026rdquo; and I represented a concept with a specific example.\nBy removing this overhead, the underlying point stands out. That\u0026rsquo;s our goal.\nGrammatical simplification such as this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make your writing worse. The complexity of your writing should emerge from the strength of its ideas, not from how those ideas are worded.\nHowever, don\u0026rsquo;t drop key information when simplifying. This, for example, would be too reductive:\n\u0026ldquo;News companies are not doing well today.\u0026rdquo;\nThat loses the point of why news companies are not doing well. Simplify your sentences without removing the nuances.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to over-index on the \u0026ldquo;make it concrete\u0026rdquo; aspect of this advice. I worry someone reading the second sentence may walk away with the mistaken understanding that Twitter is the sole driving force behind commodity journalism.\nSimilarly, a double-edged sword of abstract writing is that it can have multiple correct interpretations. Consider the following rewrite:\n One last example. Let\u0026rsquo;s remove abstract words and talk plainly:\nBad paragraph — \u0026ldquo;Ignorance of corporate dynamics represent a persistent source of pain for a certain type of operator. Intelligent but inexperienced. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that you avoid this pain by understanding how other people make decisions in the context that they\u0026rsquo;re incentivized to do so and by appreciating the constraints they\u0026rsquo;re operating within.\u0026rdquo;\nRewritten — \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s common to be a smart person who\u0026rsquo;s unaware of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I recommend writing down the frameworks your team uses to make big decisions. Then, when a colleague proposes an idea that doesn\u0026rsquo;t intuitively make sense to you, think through their idea using their own frameworks. Work from there to build empathy and have a constructive dialogue.\u0026rdquo;\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I read the \u0026ldquo;Bad paragraph\u0026rdquo; to be discussing how inter-personal and corporate politics influence an organization. The \u0026ldquo;Intelligent but inexperienced\u0026rdquo; operator would be one who knows how to do their tasks well but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know The game. As an example: They may, without intending to, make another coworker look foolish and thereby make an enemy.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Rewritten\u0026rdquo; paragraph seems to discuss how to navigate a bureaucracy with an obscured decision-making process and advocates empathy.\nA statement made in plain language would avoid this ambiguity.\n     Use fewer ideas per sentence\nAgain, I take issue with the example presented:\n Consider this bad paragraph:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a fast growing collection of data describing the structure and functional capacity of human gut bacteria in a variety of conditions. Ongoing efforts to further characterize the multitude of functions of gut bacteria and the mechanisms underlying its interactions will provide a better understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health and disease.\u0026rdquo;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s rewrite that for a thirteen-year-old:\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research on gut bacteria. We\u0026rsquo;re quickly learning which roles gut bacteria play and how they interact with each other. Researchers want to better understand how these bacteria can affect our overall health.\u0026rdquo;\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research\u0026rdquo; may read to some as \u0026ldquo;There is enough/sufficient research\u0026rdquo;.\n     Provide examples\n Tips for providing examples:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t just provide good examples, also provide bad examples. Before-and-after comparisons—like a good paragraph versus a bad paragraph—clarify what you mean and don\u0026rsquo;t mean. Help readers orient themselves on a spectrum of right to wrong. If you make your examples fun and topical, readers pay more attention. Examples with many moving parts should possibly be turned into diagrams.  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n   Goal: Be concise Also see:\n If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written A Shorter Letter The Shorter and Plainer the Better   Succinctness—a lack of bloat—helps readers finish your post. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from asking a lot of friends for feedback is that readers often quit not because they dislike your ideas, but because they\u0026rsquo;re bored.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn speech, when you say something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you can add sentences to further explain your point. Don\u0026rsquo;t do that in writing. If your sentence doesn\u0026rsquo;t resonate, you go back and rewrite it.\nWriting is a process of deliberate thought curation—where each sentence can justify its inclusion in your final draft.\nWhen a deliberate writer has written something down, they then ask:\n What is the purpose of the statement I just made? What effect does it have on the reader\u0026rsquo;s mind? Is there something more useful I could have said instead?  Later, when they get stuck expanding on their ideas, they ask:\n How can I make this point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said?  (Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Tweet test\nFeedback  Getting feedback is the most efficient way to improve your writing. This is not optional. Giving feedback is as important: giving it to others forces you to internalize the learnings from this handbook.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n   Ask for feedback from the audience you\u0026rsquo;re writing for. Here\u0026rsquo;s a template:\nIt would be helpful if you read my article slowly to transcribe the reactions you have while reading it. For example:\n  Tell me what to delete — When you notice your interest is fading, you can say \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m drifting here. This isn\u0026rsquo;t compelling and it isn\u0026rsquo;t adding value. Get to the point quicker and hook me.\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell me what to double down on — When something excites you, you can say \u0026ldquo;Dopamine hit. Go further in this direction. I have more questions.\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell me what isn\u0026rsquo;t clear — When you\u0026rsquo;re done reading, please score this from 1-10 on how satisfying it was. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to give me a low score. By telling me this needs work, you\u0026rsquo;re sparing me from releasing bad work to the public.\n  Keep asking for feedback then rewriting until you average a score of 7.5+ across a handful of respondents. That puts you in the \u0026ldquo;this was a good read\u0026rdquo; category.\nDo not waste time striving for 9+. One reader\u0026rsquo;s 9 is not the same as another\u0026rsquo;s, so trying to satisfy everyone results in a bloated post that satisfies no one. There are many great ways to tell a story, so be happy when you\u0026rsquo;ve found one that works.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n I worry that the 1-10 scale is too wide \u0026ndash; that one individual\u0026rsquo;s 7/10 isn\u0026rsquo;t meaningfully different from their 6/10. Perhaps a 1-5 scale?\n Your best source of feedback is often you with the benefit of hindsight. But you need a break to get that perspective. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a week is often enough time to sufficiently defamiliarize myself with my own writing.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nTake it from the world\u0026rsquo;s most successful hyper-prolific writer, Stephen King: he shoves his manuscript into a drawer for six weeks before writing his final draft. When he re-opens it, he sees its flaws with fresh eyes.\n(Shapiro n.d.-c)\n Writing Style  What gives a world-class author their \u0026ldquo;voice?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, ask your friends what it\u0026rsquo;s like to talk to you. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll mention your:\n Tone of voice Sense of humor Eccentricities Viewpoints  Convey those traits in your writing, and readers [will] recognize your voice. Meaning, I don\u0026rsquo;t think voice is your choice of words. It\u0026rsquo;s your unfiltered self reflected on paper.\nIn early drafts, I like to discard my reflex to self-censor. Talk vulnerably like you do with friends. In later drafts, you can remove sensitive details.\nUntil then, it\u0026rsquo;s a confession.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe antidote to inauthenticity is reminding yourself how you talk with friends. Record yourself talking, transcribe it, and work from that.\n(Shapiro n.d.-f)\n   The more steps you can be removed while still successfully communicating the meaning, the more \u0026ldquo;elegant\u0026rdquo; your poetry feels. The more profound your underlying point, the more \u0026ldquo;deep\u0026rdquo; your poetry feels.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s walk through an example using a framework I devised.\n  First-order description\nIn a first-order description, you directly describe how something is.\n\u0026ldquo;The day was hot.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is how we commonly talk.\n  Second-order description In a second-order description, you describe something by stating an effect it has on its environment.\n\u0026ldquo;The day melted our popsicles.\u0026rdquo;\nThe reader can determine that the day was therefore hot.\n  Third-order description In a third-order description, you describe something by stating its effect but not mentioning the cause by name.\n\u0026ldquo;Our popsicles melted.\u0026rdquo;\nAbove, there\u0026rsquo;s ambiguity as to why our popsicles melted. But with a bit of imagination and puzzle-solving, the reader pieces it together.\n  (Shapiro n.d.-f)\n Practicing Writing  To learn what a job well done looks like, dissect your favorite posts: highlight the best and worst parts of each and identify what makes them so.\nI find that writers who post frequently (say, twice weekly) are rarely worth reading consistently. I read for insights. And no writer can generate profound insights on a fixed schedule. I aggregate writers who publish sporadically. When they post, they truly have something to say.\n(Shapiro n.d.-b)\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Shapiro, Julian. n.d.-a. “The Writing Well Handbook.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro. ———. n.d.-b. “Writing Handbook: How to Practice Writing.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/practicing. ———. n.d.-c. “Writing Handbook: How to Rewrite Your First Draft.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/rewriting. ———. n.d.-d. “Writing Handbook: How to Source Writing Ideas.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/ideas. ———. n.d.-e. “Writing Handbook: How to Write a First Draft.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/first-draft. ———. n.d.-f. “Writing Handbook: How to Write with Style.” Accessed February 8, 2022. https://www.julian.com/guide/write/style.

This is the game about the game. It is often called \u0026lsquo;the meta\u0026rsquo;.\n   Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.\n   What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.\n   The nature of the metagame demands that you play the base game well. It lives on top of the pattern-matching that comes with expertise.\nThis seems like an obvious thing to say. But as with most such things, the second-order implications are more interesting than the first-order ones. For instance, because expertise is necessary to play the metagame, it is often useful to search for the meta in your domain as a north star for expertise. The way I remind myself of this is to say that I should \u0026lsquo;locate the meta\u0026rsquo; whenever I\u0026rsquo;m at the bottom of a skill tree. Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t yet participate, searching for the metagame that experts play will usually give me hints as to what skills I must acquire in order to become good enough.\nAn example suffices: in marketing, I have found it very useful to seek out articles or podcasts (but especially podcasts) where practitioners talk about the ways their best practices have changed: \u0026ldquo;In the past I did X and now it seems it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well, so now we do Y, and I recommend Y.\u0026rdquo; This tells me that:\nI need to learn Y and at least have a passing familiarity with X, because X is what came before and is \u0026lsquo;covered ground\u0026rsquo;, and I need to remember the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of the shift. If one such shift happened in the past, more may happen in the future. More concretely, this is something like a podcast guest saying:\n\u0026ldquo;In the past (for content marketing) I did roundup posts, but these don\u0026rsquo;t seem to work as well anymore. So now we do longer, more comprehensive guides, and we cross-launch those to Product Hunt and Hacker News and social media. That seems to work better for us.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich in turn tells me:\nI need to look up as many examples of these \u0026lsquo;comprehensive guides\u0026rsquo; to see what the state of the art looks like. From there I can develop an understanding of how they are planned, how they are executed and what success looks like when these things are launched. And I must launch one to verify their effectiveness for myself. I need to try my hand at at least one roundup post, just for the tacit experience of doing it. And I must ask: why did roundup posts fail? Well, because too many people are doing it. (Is this true? How do I verify?) Why might the current best practice fail, then? I might not know the answer to this because I am a noob, but a side-effect of (1) is that I now know the best practitioners of the guide strategy, and I can observe them to see what changes in their marketing over the next few years. Note what I\u0026rsquo;m not saying, however. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that I should actively pursue the meta — this is ineffective, because I am not good enough to play. I cannot execute even if I know where the puck is going. But studying the state of the metagame as it is right now often tells me what I must learn in order to get to that point.\n   If you can\u0026rsquo;t master a particular skill, drop back down to its component elements and practice each of them in isolation. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get good conversions in your content marketing, drop down to practice publishing at a regular cadence. If you can\u0026rsquo;t get a throw to work, break it down to arms, then legs, then body position, then into one complete motion.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Chin, Cedric. 2020. “To Get Good, Go After The Metagame.” Commonplace - the Commoncog Blog. https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/.

But that depends on an even more important proto-skill of wanting things to make sense. If you lose that skill – if it stops bothering you and seeming like a problem when things don\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you – you will never notice your confusion and you will never become a good scientist or a good anything-else-that-requires-independent-thought. And interpreting an attempt to explore dissonance as a status grab that needs to be knocked down is absolutely fatal for that skill. Instead, you need to think of it as Socratic grilling – like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly.\nTolerating this is harder than it sounds. Most people can stay helpful for one or two iterations. But most people are bad at explaining things, so one or two iterations isn\u0026rsquo;t always enough I\u0026rsquo;ve had times when I need five or ten question-answer rounds with a teacher in order to understand what they\u0026rsquo;re telling me. The process sounds a lot like \u0026ldquo;The thing you just said is obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that explanation you gave doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, you\u0026rsquo;re still obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;you keep saying the same thing over and over again, and it keeps being obviously wrong\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s irrelevant to the point that\u0026rsquo;s bothering me\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;no, that\u0026rsquo;s also irrelevant, you keep saying an obviously wrong thing\u0026rdquo;…\u0026ldquo;Oh!

","title":"Wikipedia | SMART Criteria"},{"content":"(Donnino et al. 2021)\n Psychophysiologic Symptom Relief Therapy Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction  Notes  PSRT is a treatment program designed for patients with non-specific chronic back pain. The intervention consists of a one-on-one interview with the investigator, group educational and skills-training sessions over a four-week period for approximately 1.5-2 hours per session twice per week, followed by an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program plus one full- day session/retreat. The course is delivered in small groups facilitated by a trained instructor. Participants receive reading materials on Dr. John Sarno\u0026rsquo;s and Dr. Howard Schubiner\u0026rsquo;s work to study during the intervention period. The educational sessions are focused on the relationship between psychological stress and pain and are divided in four components according to their content:\n Component 1: Psycophysiologic Pain Education  The mainstay of this component is for the participants to recognize their symptoms as a part of a psychophysiologic mind-body syndrome, as opposed to an exclusively physical etiology. This recognition is accomplished by exploring the history of their pain, identifying \u0026ldquo;inconsistencies\u0026rdquo; in the physical components of their pain (discrepancies in symptom localization and/or temporal occurrence), and acquiring information on the nature of nonspecific chronic back pain itself. Great focus is placed on the role of the relationship of underlying psychological stressors to physical pain. As participants are encouraged to examine the origin of the pain, they notice patterns in the experience of their pain that reflect the contribution of psychological and stress-related factors (e.g. experiencing severe back pain when driving but only when in heavy traffic, pain that occurs with sitting but not when sitting on a chairlift during recreational skiing, pain that is worse while walking into the workplace but fine when walking upon exiting). Hereby, participants gain awareness of the connection between pain and psychological processes and a better understanding of the variety of potentially modifiable factors that contribute to chronic back pain.\nExamples:\nIn the above example of an inconsistency, a participant complaining about back pain when driving, was able to identify that he was experiencing pain only while driving on busy roads and not on less busy roads. As a next step, the participant was able to recognize both the role of stress and the underlying emotion of anger that occurred when driving on a busy road. As the participant became able to recognize the feeling of anger in this situation, his pain during driving dissipated. This, in turn, provided insight into his pain in other circumstances and his overall pain resolved over time in conjunction with the other components of this program.\nAnother participant experienced pain while sitting, yet upon reflection, she recognized there were times when sitting did not cause pain such as when she was knitting (an activity she loved to do and which she found relaxing). During the course of this program, she was able to recognize this \u0026ldquo;inconsistency\u0026rdquo; as well as others and worked on desensitization (see component II). Additionally, she was able to realize that she put tremendous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother and wife. As she learned to be more accepting of herself, her unrealistic expectations of herself were reduced as was her pain experience.\n Component 2: Desensitization and Returning to Physical Activity  One of the main contributors hypothesized to contribute to chronic pain derived from psychophysiologic causes is that pain becomes a conditioned response to a physical trigger. According to the classical conditioning model, previously neutral stimuli can become linked to the pain experience. Thus, without the need for a current nociceptive input, this association can be coupled with physical reactions ultimately leading to pain. For example, formerly elicited pain-induced muscle tensions can become associated with other stimuli like sitting or walking and lead to fear and avoidance of these positions/movements. This association can result in fear of recreating pain and thus avoidance of these movements Therefore, one of the key components of our therapy program is to \u0026ldquo;desensitize\u0026rdquo; the participants and break the cycle of pain. In order to achieve this goal, multiple desensitization techniques are utilized in this phase.\nVisual motor imagery (mental simulation of a painful situation) is a desensitization technique during which the participant is asked to first visualize a movement where pain typically occurs. Often (though not universally) the visualization will bring on pain. When this occurs, this serves to help the participant recognize that the pain can be elicited simply in his or her mind without any physical movement. This concept helps support the fact that the pain is psychophysiologic in nature. Next, the person is encouraged to repeatedly visualize the movement which caused pain while they are repeating self-soothing statements. With these repeated visualizations (without physical movement), the pain can ultimately wane and cannot be reproduced using visualization alone. When this process is complete (and pain can no longer be elicited), the patient can then proceed with slowly undertaking the actual movements/positions (see example below).\nAdditionally, identifying conditioned responses in daily life is a crucial part of this phase. For example, if sitting were a trigger, one would sit with the knowledge that the pain associated with sitting is a conditioned response and not actually related to some physical injury or component of sitting. Over time, the pain will dissipate, and the conditioning will be effectively reversed, allowing the participant to return to full physical activity. By returning to previous physical activity, patients also reinforce the \u0026ldquo;knowledge therapy\u0026rdquo; component as they begin to recognize that pain is not actually related to physical triggers per se, but rather psychological triggers. The safety of participants during this process is ensured through the gradual increase of activity under the supervision of a physician (see examples below).\nExample:\nA participant reported having pain with prolonged standing and notably when standing at a bus stop waiting for work. She attributed the pain to the physical activity of prolonged standing. Occasionally, she would return home and miss work because of the severity of the pain. During our program, she first visualized standing at the bus stop, and this reproduced her pain and discomfort. The ability for her to bring on severe pain simply through visualization allowed her to recognize the psychological component of her pain. She then reflected further on the situation from a different perspective and recognized that she was under a great degree of psychological stress while at the bus stop anticipating her day at work. With all this in mind, she first performed visual motor imagery repeatedly over a few days using self-soothing techniques until she reached the point that she could no longer reproduce the pain during visualization. Then, she stood at the bus stop reminding herself that the origin of the pain was not the physical act of standing. Over time, she stood for longer periods of time and the pain decreased despite the overall increase in physical activity. Ultimately, the pain resolved to the point where prolonged standing was no longer a trigger for her pain.\n Component 3: Emotional Expression - Psycology of the Syndrome  Reports on \u0026ldquo;functional\u0026rdquo; back pain conditions date back from as early as 1946 (1). The notion that chronic pain may persist as a manifestation of unexpressed negative affective states (e.g. hostility or aggressive impulses that the individual is unwilling or unable to acknowledge) was formulated in 1959 (2). Taking into consideration that some of the contributors to persistent pain include underlying stressful conflicts and aversive affective states, strategies encouraging emotional expression are essential in the treatment of mind-body syndrome. Emotional expression is accomplished through a series of writing exercises and journaling (free writing, cluster writing, letters of forgiveness, gratitude lists), self-reflection, as well as through small group discussion. A recent treatment developed by Drs. Schubiner and Lumley, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), includes similar techniques (3).\nAs an example, a participant realized during the above-mentioned exercises that he was being negatively impacted by the emotional pain caused by the imminent ending of his marriage. As he began to express his emotions, he noticed a significant reduction in his physical pain. Another example noted earlier was a patient who developed severe pain when driving on crowded streets but not on roads without traffic. He ultimately recognized that he was experiencing anger and frustration in a number of specific situations such as being stuck in traffic. This awareness of anger-related contributions to his pain (rather than an exclusively physical explanation that sitting for long periods results in mechanically induced increases in pain) and subsequent expression of those negative emotions helped the patient to improve his pain.\n Component 4: Stress reduction - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  As stress is an underlying component of MBS, the final arm of the program is to engage in stress-reduction techniques. By starting this program with the PSRT portion, participants are often already seeing improvements before embarking on this last portion of the program. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for the prevention and treatment of stress related disorders (4). MBSR has been linked to significant improvements in overall health and well-being, leading to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain (5, 6, 7). MBSR is an 8-week educational program which includes weekly sessions and mindful practice. Students are encouraged to perform daily home practice, which is explored throughout the program. Our MBSR classes adhered to the original protocol of the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. Our mindfulness sessions entail a series of strategies for cultivating present moment awareness - the ability to experience what is arising in the present moment. This allows for the observation of thoughts (past or future), the disengagement from emotional reactivity and the ability to stay with the sensate experience in the body - the outcome of which is a deeper sense of ease, emotional balance and general well-being.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Donnino, Michael W., Garrett S.

Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.  One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.   The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.  There is no \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; study method, though some are better than others. The study method which will be most effective will depend on the situation in which you will need to recall the information.    Terms  Testing Effect Item-specific Processing Relational Processing Permastore  Thoughts Anki seems highly relevant here; it combines spaced repetition and the benefits of the testing effect. However, I think it would be easy to create flashcards which aid in memorizing a fact but not in understanding or application. For instance: I could imagine a card which asks you to recall the abstract steps required to multiply a IxJ matrix by a JxK matrix. I think this card, on its own, would not be sufficient to maintain understanding or the ability to perform matrix multiplication. Perhaps you could supplement the card with others which ask:\n What conditions are necessary to multiply two matrices (AxB and CxD)? A card, or several, which provide specific examples using numbers rather than generalizations? Perhaps there is a script or addon which allows for this sort of thing.  I worry that Anki wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough to maintain understanding and the ability to apply this knowledge even with these, and more, cards. It would certainly reduce the barrier to re-entry. I used to understand much more calculus than I could prove to you now after letting it fall out of my mind since college. Keeping up with calculus topics, example problems, definitions, etc, through Anki would at least make it easier for me to jump back in should the need arise. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be as \u0026ldquo;on the ball\u0026rdquo; as I would if I were actively using and practicing calculus regularly, but I would be at a better place than I am now.\nMemory in Educational Settings Guiding Theoretical Principles Introducing \u0026ldquo;Desirable Difficulties\u0026rdquo; During Learning  Performance during learning is a poor predictor of future performance because it reflects the momentary accessibility of knowledge (i.e., retrieval strength) rather than how well it has been stored in memory (i.e., storage strength)\n   Storage strength increases when a memory is retrieved or the event is reexperienced.\n   [I]f knowledge is to be retained over long periods of time, then the goal of learning must be to increase storage strength, not momentary accessibility.\n   Based on the distinction between retrieval strength and storage strength, R. A. Bjork and colleagues developed the concept of \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulties\u0026rdquo; in learning (Bjork, 1994a, 1994b; Christina \u0026amp; Bjork, 1991; Schmidt \u0026amp; Bjork, 1992). The main idea is that introducing difficulties during learning will result in superior long-term retention because the greatest gains in storage strength occur when retrieval strength is low. For example, consider the practice of using flash cards to study vocabulary words. If you study a word and then try to remember it immediately, then the gain in storage strength will be relatively low because it is so easy to retrieve the word right away (retrieval strength is high). However, if you wait 5 minutes before attempting to retrieve the word (when retrieval strength will be lower), then the gain in storage strength will be larger. The implication for educational practice is that instead of arranging the conditions of learning to be easier and faster for the learner, educators should introduce difficulties into the learning process in order to promote long-term retention of knowledge.\n Processing Information to Extract Meaning  Critically, directing attention at a lower or \u0026ldquo;shallow\u0026rdquo; level of processing (e.g., focusing on the orthography of words while reading) disrupts higher or \u0026ldquo;deeper\u0026rdquo; levels of processing (e.g., determining what those words mean). As a result, the type of processing in which one consciously engages determines what information will be encoded into memory and retained. The type of processing is more important than the intent to learn (e.g., Craik \u0026amp; Tulving, 1975); the implication is that a student who deliberately prepares for a test but who does not engage in deep processing will not do as well as the student who processes the material deeply, even if the latter student is not deliberately trying to learn the material.\n   One helpful distinction involves item- specific processing versus relational processing (Hunt \u0026amp; Einstein, 1981). Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.\nIn contrast, relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other. In short, both item-specific and relational processing can involve meaning extraction, but they direct the learner to different aspects of the to-be- remembered events.\n Importance of Match Between Processing at Encoding and Retrieval  Rather, memory performance is the joint product of the way in which the memory was encoded (i.e., the memory trace that is stored) and the way in which it is retrieved (i.e., the cues provided) (e.g., Tulving \u0026amp; Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving \u0026amp; Osler, 1968). This idea is codified in the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, which states that memory performance will be enhanced to the extent that the processes engaged during initial learning match the processes required for the criterial task\n   In short, there is not always a single right answer about which study strategy will be best. Rather, as reflected in ideas about transfer-appropriate processing, the ideal study strategy depends upon what the student will need to do later.\n Summary  We have presented three general cognitive principles that are critical for determining memory performance in educational settings:\n introducing desirable difficulties during learning engaging in processes that emphasize meaning extraction and matching learning processes to the processes needed to excel on the final criterial task (i.e., transfer-appropriate processing).   Learning Strategies for Studying Material Receiving Advance Organizers Highlighting and Underlining Note Taking  Although note taking yields memorial benefits, the type of notes naturally taken may not be the most powerful mnemonic possible. One issue involves how much note taking involves going beyond the to-be-remembered information (versus simply copying; see Marsh \u0026amp; Sink, 2010), including paraphrasing the to-be-remembered information and connecting it to stored knowledge. Returning to the levels of processing framework, the key issue is the depth of processing note taking naturally affords. We have just reviewed evidence that note taking encourages relational processing that affords transfer. Nevertheless, additional benefit may come from techniques that encourage the reader or listener to process the material even more deeply. For example, King (1992) trained students to summarize material, specifically how to identify and encapsulate the main idea. This group of students was compared to another group who took notes naturally, and who later had a chance to review those notes. Students who summarized the lecture performed better on both immediate and delayed comprehension tests than students who took notes (see Bretzing \u0026amp; Kulhavy, 1979, for similar results). Similarly, the note-taking group did not do as well as a group of students trained to ask themselves (and answer) questions about the material. Students might benefit from incorporating some of these deep processing techniques into their notes; in other words, training might help students to take notes that include more of the generative processing thought to be key for transfer (e.g., Peper \u0026amp; Mayer, 1978).\n Learning Strategies for Poststudy Retrieval Practice  \u0026hellip; memory research has shown that retrieving information from memory actually changes memory (e.g., Bjork, 1975), improving long-term retention of the material\n   The finding that retrieval practice produces superior long-term retention has been termed the testing effect\n   When testing is used as a learning tool in educational settings, there are several ways in which its efficacy can be enhanced.\n Tests that require students to produce a response, such as short-answer and essay tests, generally lead to better retention than tests that simply require the selection of the correct response, such as multiple-choice tests and true/false tests. Taking multiple tests results in better retention than taking a single test, so it is beneficial to repeat questions on quizzes and give cumulative exams. Successful retrieval is the key to learning from tests, so providing feedback after the test is essential, especially if test-takers do not retrieve many correct responses  (paraphrased)\n Processing Feedback to Correct Errors  The most consistent result is that providing learners with the correct answer in the feedback message produces better subsequent performance than simply indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect (e.g., Pashler et al., 2005; for a meta-analysis, see Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, \u0026amp; Morgan, 1991). This finding makes sense because informing the learner that a given response is incorrect will not help the learner to correct the error if the learner does not have any recourse to learn the correct answer.\n Spacing Out Practice Over Time  \u0026hellip; [I]t seems that the optimal interval depends on how long the knowledge needs to be retained after the last practice (i.e., the retention interval). Cepeda and colleagues (2006; see also Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, \u0026amp; Pashler, 2008) performed a meta-analysis that included 317 experiments from 184 articles on the spacing effect. They found that the optimal spacing interval is approximately 10%–20% of the retention interval. Thus, if the goal is to retain the material for 5 days, then practice should be spaced over intervals between 12 and 24 hours\n Combining Techniques Applying the Guiding Principles and Learning Strategies in Educational Settings Long-Term Learning Learning Beyond Facts  \u0026hellip; [I]n the classroom, educators have many different goals for their students, and these goals vary as a function of the level of education, the type of course, and the time frame given for learning, among many other factors. One way of categorizing these goals is through Bloom\u0026rsquo;s (1956) taxonomy of educational objectives, which conceptualizes learning as a hierarchy in which the various levels must be mastered in sequential order. The cognitive domain is comprised of six levels (from lowest to highest):\n knowledge (e.g., learning facts, concepts, etc.) comprehension (e.g., understanding the relationship between ideas) application (e.g., using knowledge to solve new problems) analysis (e.g., finding evidence to support a hypothesis) synthesis (e.g., combining different accounts of an event to understand what occurred) evaluation (e.g., assessing the validity of an idea according to certain criteria)   Permastore\nThe Relativity of Memory References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Marsh, Elizabeth J., and Andrew C.

Not only they have weak coding skills but there are also a few other things that give Junior developers away:\n Their main mantra is \u0026ldquo;making it work\u0026rdquo; without giving much attention to how the solution is achieved. To them, a working software and good software are equivalent. They usually require very specific and structured directions to achieve something. They suffer from tunnel vision, need supervision and continuous guidance to be effective team members. Most of the Junior developers just try to live up to the role and, when stuck, they might leave work for a senior developer instead of at least trying to take a stab at something. They don\u0026rsquo;t know about the business side of the company and don\u0026rsquo;t realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and they don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much rework, wasted effort, and end-user aggravation could be saved by getting to know the business domain. Over-engineering is a major problem, often leading to fragility and bugs. When given a problem, they often try to fix just the current problem a.k.a. fixing the symptoms instead of fixing the root problem. You might notice the \u0026ldquo;Somebody Else\u0026rsquo;s Problem\u0026rdquo; behavior from them. They don\u0026rsquo;t know what or how much they don\u0026rsquo;t know, thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect. They don\u0026rsquo;t take initiatives and they might be afraid to work on an unfamiliar codebase. They don\u0026rsquo;t participate in team discussions.   Mid Level Developers  The next level after the Junior developers is Mid Level developers. They are technically stronger than the Junior developers and can work with minimal supervision. They still have some issues to address in order to jump to Senior level.\n   Mid-level developers are quite common. Most of the organizations wrongly label them as \u0026ldquo;Senior Developers\u0026rdquo;. However, they need further mentoring in order to become Senior Developers.\n Senior Developers  Senior developers are the next level after the Mid-level developers. They are the people who can get things done on their own without any supervision and without creating any issues down the road. They are more mature, have gained experience by delivering both good and bad software in the past and have learned from it — they know how to be pragmatic. Here is the list of things that are normally expected of a Senior Developer:\n With their past experiences, mistakes made, issues faced by over-designed or under-designed software, they can foresee the problems and persuade the direction of the codebase or the architecture. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;Shiny-Toy\u0026rdquo; syndrome. They are pragmatic in the execution. They can make the tradeoffs when required, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic. They have a good picture of the field, know what the best tool for the job is in most cases (even if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the tool). They have the innate ability to pick up a new tool/language/paradigm/etc in order to solve a problem that requires it. They are aware they\u0026rsquo;re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs to taking un-glorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done. They have a deep understanding of the domain - they know about the business side of the company and realize how management/sales/marketing/etc think and benefit from their knowledge of the business domain during the development. They don\u0026rsquo;t make empty complaints, they make judgments based on the empirical evidence and they have suggestions for solutions. They think much more than just code - they know that their job is to provide solutions to the problems and not just to write code. They have the ability to take on large ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract, and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them. They have respect for the code that was written before them. They are generous when passing judgment on the architecture or the design decisions made in the codebase. They approach inheriting legacy code with an \u0026ldquo;opportunity mindset\u0026rdquo; rather than a complaining one. They know how to give feedback without hurting anyone.

Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a \u0026ldquo;fear of success\u0026rdquo;; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)\nWhy do most of us, most of the time, choose to \u0026ldquo;pursue our goals\u0026rdquo; through routes that are far less effective than the routes we could find if we tried? My guess is that here, as with the calculus test, the main problem is that most courses of action are extremely ineffective, and that there has been no strong evolutionary or cultural force sufficient to focus us on the very narrow behavior patterns that would actually be effective.\nTo be more specific: there are clearly at least some limited senses in which we have goals. We: (1) tell ourselves and others stories of how we\u0026rsquo;re aiming for various \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;; (2) search out modes of activity that are consistent with the role, and goal-seeking, that we see ourselves as doing (\u0026ldquo;learning math\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;becoming a comedian\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;being a good parent\u0026rdquo;); and sometimes even (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do/don\u0026rsquo;t achieve our \u0026ldquo;goals\u0026rdquo;.\nBut there are clearly also heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement (or that would be part of what it means to \u0026ldquo;have goals\u0026rdquo; at all) that we do not automatically carry out. We do not automatically:\n(a) Ask ourselves what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve; (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (\u0026ldquo;what does it look like to be a good comedian?\u0026quot;) and how we can track progress; (c) Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal; (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven\u0026rsquo;t worked for us in the past); (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren\u0026rsquo;t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don\u0026rsquo;t work; (f) Focus most of the energy that isn\u0026rsquo;t going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our \u0026ldquo;goal\u0026rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won\u0026rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting; \u0026hellip;. or carry out any number of other useful techniques. Instead, we mostly just do things. We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal. We do any number of things. But we do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions that would effectively optimize for our claimed goals, or for any other goals.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Salamon, Anna. 2010. “Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic.” Less Wrong. https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PBRWb2Em5SNeWYwwB/humans-are-not-automatically-strategic.

A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people. An essay is stronger when it can afford to omit qualification (eg: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps\u0026rdquo;).  Additionally, for Graham, a useful essay is one which says things as simply as possible.\nThoughts Notes  What should an essay be? [\u0026hellip;] useful.\n   Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn\u0026rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.\n   In effect the [novelty, correctness, importance, and strength] are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.\n   [\u0026hellip;] if you write a bad sentence, you don\u0026rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s a trick for getting importance too. It\u0026rsquo;s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they\u0026rsquo;ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.\n   The way to get novelty is to write about topics you\u0026rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who\u0026rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers.\n   [\u0026hellip;] strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. [\u0026hellip;] As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you\u0026rsquo;re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm\u0026rsquo;s length with perhapses.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It\u0026rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it\u0026rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader\u0026rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that\u0026rsquo;s too long.\n   Sometimes the reason people don\u0026rsquo;t know something is because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to know it.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Graham, Paul. n.d. “How to Write Usefully.” Accessed February 7, 2022. http://paulgraham.com/useful.html.

Today, about 25% are.\n   The answer to all these questions seems to be something like \u0026ldquo;the body is pretty good at regulating its own weight under any diet except modern American processed food.\u0026rdquo; But what aspect of processed food makes it bad?\n   The only common villain everyone agrees on in the obesity story is \u0026ldquo;processed food\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve previously found this frustrating – it reeks of a sort of unreflective technophobia. What part of processing makes food bad? How does mere contact with a machine turn food from healthy to unhealthy? What food counts as \u0026ldquo;processed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;not processed\u0026rdquo;? Is ground beef processed, since you grind it? Are scrambled eggs processed, since you scramble them? Is bread processed, since wheat doesn\u0026rsquo;t grow in loaves? Is water processed, since it goes through water processing facilities? Is the Eucharist processed, even though the processing only changes its metaphysical essence and not its physical properties?

In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?\nNotes  [\u0026hellip;] the notion that \u0026lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching\u0026rsquo; [\u0026hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I\u0026rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.\nThe first idea is the \u0026lsquo;recognition-primed decision making\u0026rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses. I\u0026rsquo;ve written extensively about the model on this blog, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to repeat myself [\u0026hellip;] but the core of it is simply that expertise is an implicit memory operation: you recognise a situation in a developing environment and then unspool that recognition into a set of cues, a list of plausible goals, and handful of expectancies, and a series of trained actions. if the situation is novel, you construct variants of intended actions on the fly and simulate these scenarios in a loop, picking the first workable solution in your mind.\nThis model of expert decision-making is useful because it gives us a usable model of expertise — far better than the ones found in the deliberate practice literature. For example, one conclusion from this model is that if you want to become better at something, you should look for ways to expand the set of recognisable prototypes in your head.\nThe second idea is simply that expertise rests on technê, or tacit knowledge — the sort of knowledge that is impossible to communicate, that must be constructed from practice. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this idea numerous times over the past two years: first in my original criticism of mental model writing, then in my reflection on Seymour Papert\u0026rsquo;s life\u0026rsquo;s work. I covered it again in The Mental Model FAQ and The Dangers of Treating Ideas from Finance as Generalised Self Help. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it here and there throughout Commonplace\u0026rsquo;s history; indeed, my reliance on technê is one of the big pieces of idea scaffolding for this blog.\n[emphasis mine]\n   [\u0026hellip;] perhaps the art of practice is simply whatever is the most effective method of expanding one\u0026rsquo;s collection of recognisable prototypes (and of course: the actions to take in response to those recognisable prototypes).\n   What about creativity, for instance? Klein covers this in his research; in Sources of Power he discusses how expert minds use pattern-recognition to identify \u0026lsquo;leverage points\u0026rsquo; — points in which one could do something radically different — in order to come up with creative solutions within the constraints of some domain. I\u0026rsquo;ve dug a little into the research and I think the take is plausible, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely convinced. Surely the mechanism of creativity is different from the prototype-based recognition that drives most of expertise? The short answer to that seems to be \u0026lsquo;yes, creativity relies on connections between different ideas and this is independent of expertise\u0026rsquo; but also \u0026lsquo;identifying the right leverage points is still a recognition/expertise thing\u0026rsquo;. The two seem highly intertwined in the sorts of fields that Klein studies; my remaining scepticism is that I do not know if this is true in \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; creative domains like art and design and fiction writing.\n Thoughts The idea rings true to me when I think about how chess masters describe thinking about the game in the moment.

A more direct essay could have started out by stating the problems with Gottman\u0026rsquo;s research. You could argue this essay buried the lede. That said, I enjoyed reading the piece. I find it more enjoyable to read a story than a data sheet.\nNotes  The secret to a happy marriage is that you should like your spouse.\n   Don\u0026rsquo;t have a fight when you\u0026rsquo;re physiologically aroused. Don\u0026rsquo;t have a fight when you\u0026rsquo;re physiologically aroused. Monitor your physiological arousal, and if you start to notice the signs – fast heartbeat, tense muscles, shallow breathing – call a time-out, go somewhere else, and use meditation or deep breathing or whatever to calm down.\n   Gottman divides conflicts into two types: solvable and unsolvable. Solvable conflicts are simple, specific, and about the thing they seem to be about – for example, the husband is supposed to take the trash out after work, but work has gotten really stressful lately and he keeps forgetting, and now the trash is overflowing and the wife is annoyed. The solution here is to use normal problem-solving techniques. Put a sign in the bedroom saying \u0026ldquo;DID YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT?\u0026rdquo; or something. Whatever.\nUnsolvable conflicts are temporary manifestations of deep psychological issues. The particular thing that sparked the fight this time is irrelevant, but both spouses will fight to the death because it represents something important. For example, the husband is late to dinner one night because he went out to the bar. The wife yells at him and says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about her. He yells back that she\u0026rsquo;s a control freak. Here the problem will not be solved by coming up with a compromise where he can go to the bar half of nights. The problem is that she secretly worries his drinking buddies have a closer connection to him than she ever will, that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t love her anymore, that he goes to the bar to escape her. He worries that he\u0026rsquo;s lost his freedom, that he\u0026rsquo;s become emasculated, that he\u0026rsquo;s become some boring old person who is never allowed to have fun. If the bar burnt down tomorrow, they would find some other excuse to fight over this dynamic.\n   Desperation breeds gullibility. Patients with terminal diseases, however smart they used to be, turn to homeopaths and charlatans rather than face the dismal truth.\n   [\u0026hellip;] whenever I hear people talk about relationships, I hear weird echoes of political problems. People who hate their spouse have an outgroup of one. A unified polity has devolved into partisanship. Social trust has been broken; a defect-defect equilibrium is in place. Gottman thinks of couples as a two-person culture, and some of those cultures are decadent and fractious.\n   In marriage, as in other forms of politics, sometimes exit \u0026gt; voice. Which is probably not something marriage counselors want to think about very much.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Alexander, Scott. 2020. “Book Review: The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work.” Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/27/book-review-the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work/.

And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n   There\u0026rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you\u0026rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the main reason that speed is important.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren\u0026rsquo;t just about churning out work—they\u0026rsquo;re about processing information more quickly. The faster you process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.\nIn other words, the main benefit of being fast is that you end up doing different things. Nelson Elhage\u0026rsquo;s point—\u0026ldquo;having faster tools changes how users use a tool\u0026rdquo;—applies across nearly every domain:\n If you respond to your emails quickly instead of slowly, you\u0026rsquo;ll get access to more new opportunities, and end up prioritizing them over whatever you would have done instead. If you make it 10x faster to test your code, you don\u0026rsquo;t just save time waiting on tests—you can start doing test-driven development, discover your mistakes earlier, and save yourself from going down bad paths. If you deploy your new app now instead of next week, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how users like the new features one week earlier, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to feed that knowledge back into future product decisions.  That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast doesn\u0026rsquo;t just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. Over time, that makes an enormous difference.\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;} ","permalink":"http://cashpw.com/posts/2149d460-f6e0-4696-b34d-c2cc2228d8db/","summary":"Ben Kuhn, [\u0026lt;@kuhnBeImpatient2022-01-01T13:00:00Z\u0026gt; |\nSummary Thoughts Notes  Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things.

I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.\n Wondrous The Space Within  The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.\n   The task was to make a cylinder. The word \u0026ldquo;pot\u0026rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.\n Beginnings and Endings  The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.\n   The variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.\n Cylinders as Pots  The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.\n   Of particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.\n   The cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).\n Figure 44\nPitchers  It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.\n   A useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.\n   If you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.\n Bowls  Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.\n Pots with Lids Learning to See Style and Voice Utility and Tradition Place Notes References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}Illian, Clary. 2012.

Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I\u0026rsquo;d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.\nIn the short term, this made me less efficient, because I\u0026rsquo;d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for long enough, I\u0026rsquo;d eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner\u0026rsquo;s API in a fit of rage.

I predict that as this sector evolves, we\u0026rsquo;ll get better at optimizing attention capital, and accordingly leave behind our current culture of communication overload.\n(Newport n.d.)\n   The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to concentrate without distraction on a demanding task (what I call \u0026ldquo;deep work\u0026rdquo;) is becoming more rare at the same time that it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more valuable in the knowledge sector. As a result, those individuals and organizations who put in the hard work to cultivate this skill will thrive.\n(Newport n.d.)\n   Digital Minimalism: The services delivered through your devices have become so alluring and addictive that they can significantly erode the quality of your life and your sense of autonomy. My solution is a philosophy I call digital minimalism, which argues that you should radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small number of activities chosen because they support things you deeply value, and then happily miss out on everything else.\n(Newport n.d.)\n   Attention Capital Theory: In modern knowledge work, the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains' ability to create new value through sustained attention.

You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\ncrdrost\n   Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called \u0026ldquo;desirable difficulty\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that learning something, forgetting it and then struggling to learn it again leads to faster learning times. It may be that struggle is inherent in the process of learning something complex. If you equate struggle with pain, then I think it makes some sense.\nmikekchar\n   In my ~20 years of experience, the only way to get good at something that is incredibly complex like kernel development, you will need to actually try to build the thing. Over and over and over.\nbob1029\n   In the language learning example, Extensive Reading leads to not only picking up and remembering words, but also collocations, grammar and even cultural beliefs of the speakers of the target language. Single word flash cards miss all of that. Full sentence flashcards do a bit better but still fall short.\nI think the best use for SRS for something like a language or programming is for laying down a scaffold in the very early stages of learning, and then moving to more productive uses of study time as soon as possible.\nAlchemistCamp, replying to stared\n This raises an important point in the use of spaced repetition systems (SRS). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to be able to write a good essay if they only studied the meaning of words. Spaced repetition systems lend themselves easily to the study of small chunks of information (eg: definitions) but it is more difficult to apply them to higher-level applications of knowledge and understanding (eg: essay writing).\n I think semantic tree/first principles/physics-based approach (popularly attributed to Elon Musk) is one way to approach it. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a really difficult approach and you need a certain level of intelligence and personality to do it well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. I can do it to some extent but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really difficult to hold lots of ideas in tension and to be questioning all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s just not my thinking style.\nThe other approach is what many smart (but non-geniuses) take: the buffet approach. You graze at the table of books, Wikipedia, online articles, and hang out in online communities (like Twitter) to overhear what experts are discussing. The thing about most areas of knowledge is, there\u0026rsquo;s usually only 20% of the subject that matters\u0026ndash;the rest rarely come up (Pareto Principle). To know what 20% to focus on, you need to understand the sociology of the subject matter and what experts think are important. Unlike the previous approach, you won\u0026rsquo;t have watershed-level insights, but you\u0026rsquo;ll know enough to be considered \u0026ldquo;educated\u0026rdquo; on the subject.\nwenc\n References .csl-entry{text-indent: -1.5em; margin-left: 1.5em;}“Ask HN: How Do You Learn Complex, Dense Technical Information?” n.d.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.\nNote that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.\nWhy Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.\nI expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment. I chose to attempt a sleep schedule called dual core, which has 5.5 sleeping hours per day, as it was supposed2 to be possible to maintain the schedule indefinitely.\n   Sleep Schedule Hours Awake Per Day Expected Years Left1 Expected Waking Years Left     Monophasic 15 50.4 31.50   Dual Core 1 18.5 50.4 38.85    As the table indicates: sleeping for 3.5 fewer hours daily equates to an increased waking-time life expectancy of 7.35 years. But what would I do with those hours?\nGiven that this was a trial, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to put too much presure on myself to do anything in particular with my new time. I expected that I would be exhausted as I adapted to the new sleep schedule.\nThe Trial Sleep Schedule The dual core sleep schedule I attempted was composed of three sleeping times per day.\n   Name Start time End time Duration (hours)     Core 1 22:00 01:30 3.5   Core 2 05:30 07:00 1.5   Nap 13:30 14:00 0.5    I maintained this schedule for 40 days from April 4th, 2021 through June 13th, 2021.\nMeasuring the Impact I opted to do no cognitive tests, etc, during this trial. I had read enough to indicate that I would likely see a drop-off on the tests and wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in validating that idea. What I was looking to test was more subjective: is this sleep schedule something I feel I could maintain for years at a time? A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer to this question would imply that the negative impacts are either non-existant or small enough that I felt that the increased waking hours made it a worthwhile trade off.\nRetrospective How I Felt Discussions of polyphasic sleep all mention an acclimation period where the individual is adjusting to the new sleeping schedule. The underlying principle is repartitioning. In short, it\u0026rsquo;s the idea that the phases of sleep you pass through each night will be rearranged if you start getting less sleep regularly so as to prioritize more important sleep phases3. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to feel much less groggy after passing through this period of adjustment which lasts between 2-5 weeks depending on the individual.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature. What I did find suggested that rather than adjusting to the reduced number of sleeping hours, the mind eventually loses the ability to tell that it\u0026rsquo;s tired due to the negative impact of the lack of sleep. I recall a mention of how sleep deprived individuals consistently underestimated how tired they were and overestimated their abilities in cognitive and reflex tests.\nNonetheless, I did start to feel better around day 22. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much in my life that demands high physical precision or quick reflexes, and perhaps that is why I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any decrease in physical abilty during the trial. I continued to lift weights (531), row, and do basic yoga without incident. Mental tasks, however, were impacted. I work as a software engineer and I noticed that I was, on average (there were better and worse days) mentally tired sooner than I had been before the trial started. I\u0026rsquo;d say during an 8 hour work day I would feel drained around the 5 hour mark where-as I had previously felt drained around the 6 hour mark.\nOverall I would say that I felt good during the trial; probably worse on average than prior but not by much. Again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about small changes in how I felt. This trial was more focused on whether there was or wasn\u0026rsquo;t a large negative impact to how I felt. I\u0026rsquo;d say that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a negative impact.\nPhysical Symptoms Sleepiness Suprisingly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much more tired than I had been previously. I would feel tired, sure, but I had felt just as tired, or at least not much more, on days prior to starting the experiment. I do think I was more tired \u0026ndash; just not as dramatically as I had expected to be based on the 3.5 fewer hours of sleep.\nDifficulty Waking Up I woke up easily in that I was able to get out of bed when my alarm went off on all (save 3) mornings. However, many (\u0026gt;25%) mornings started with a 30-60 minute period where I had a terrible mental fog that left me unable to focus on much.\n\u0026ldquo;Third Person\u0026rdquo; Feelings Do you know the feeling when you watch a movie, play, TV show, etc, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally drawn into it so that the real world fades away for a time? Now, have you ever been in that state of being drawn in but are then released from that grip by something such that you realize \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m watching a TV show right now\u0026rdquo; before the show is over? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this gets the point across but I had several such experiences except with myself as the focal point.\nI would be talking to my fiance, or friends, or just doing the dishes, and I would suddenly be \u0026ldquo;aware\u0026rdquo; of myself rather than just \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; myself. I named this feeling based on first-person versus third-person camera view in video games. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these qualify as out-of-body experiences but perhaps they could be though of as light out-of-body experiences. I was definitly still \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;, just with a different camera angle.\nHeadaches I had headaches more frequently than ever in my life. They were light and manageable but annoying. I\u0026rsquo;d say I had a headache for an hour or so once every 3-5 days during the trial whereas I usually get headaches (which aren\u0026rsquo;t caused by lack of water, etc) around once ever 4-6 months.\nSticking to the Schedule Polyphasic sleep schedules which reduce total sleeping time require more strict adherance to the sleep schedule to avoid grogginess, etc4. As such, I attempted to stick to my schedule exactly. I tracked my sleeping time using Sleep as Android and can see that I missed three naps and zero core sleeps. I regularly laid down within 2-3 minutes of the scheduled starting time and overslept only 3 times during the trial.\nQuality of Sleep I slept soundly during both cores and the nap and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with waking up too early. Similarly, I was able to fall asleep quickly for both core and naps.\nSleep as Android tracks the duration of \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; and I saw no meaningful change in the durations before and during the trial. My \u0026ldquo;deep sleep\u0026rdquo; duration remained between 3-4 hours daily.\nHow I Seemed to Those Around Me I live with my fiance and we sleep in the same bed. I kept the trial a secret from her for two weeks (she\u0026rsquo;s a heavy sleeper) as a form of control group in case I was acting strangely and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it myself. She said I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed any different over the previous weeks once I let her in on my new sleep schedule. This could either mean that (1) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t any different during the trial, (2) that the changes were slight enough to be ignored or missed, or (3) that I act sleep deprived regularly.\nSleep Schedule Going Forward I\u0026rsquo;m back on my previous monophasic sleep schedule. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve incorporated the nap into it as I felt a mental pick-up from getting a bit of sleep in the middle of the day.\nI had started the trial to see if this sleep schedule is something I could maintain indefinitly. Looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 40 days is long enough to answer that question. I think I\u0026rsquo;d need a 100+ day trial to answer that. However, I became aware during the trial that there\u0026rsquo;s something else for me to focus on prior to starting a longer trial.\nMore and more I noticed that I was doing about the same work/play/reading/etc just over a longer period of time. That is, I was awake more but didn\u0026rsquo;t have more to show for it. I\u0026rsquo;m not writing off additional polyphasic sleep schedule trials in the future. However, I want to be sure that I make use of the additional hours. If I don\u0026rsquo;t, then why not just keep sleeping through them?\nTo that end I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my focus from \u0026ldquo;get more hours\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;do more with the hours I have\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll take another look at polyphasic sleep once I get to the point where I feel I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the hours I already have.\n  Based on my current age and life expectancy.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The vast majority of writing I found with a positive tilt on polyphasic sleep is annecdotal.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Note that I haven\u0026rsquo;t found much support for this idea in peer-reviewed sleep literature.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I don\u0026rsquo;t recall where I read this.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"http://cashpw.com/posts/6a214828-bea5-47be-bac7-0f0235b0ff3c/","summary":"What would you do with another few hours every day?

To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, \u0026quot;Concretely, how does one achieve that?\u0026quot;\n   Cached Selves by Anna Salamon\nThe idea that my actions are so easily influenced is disconcerting to say the least. The author is writing about commitment and consistency effects with the goal of reducing their effectiveness. I think it would be wise to attempt to incorporate a bit of the author's advice into how I conduct myself. The most straight-forward suggestion is to \u0026quot;[t]ake care never to say anything but what is best supported by the evidence, aloud or to yourself, lest you come to believe it\u0026quot;. Identifying what is supported by the evidence and which evidence is trust-worthy is another can of worms.\n  Humans Are Not Automatically Strategic by Anna Salamon\n We act from habit; we act from impulse or convenience when primed by the activities in front of us; we remember our goal and choose an action that feels associated with our goal.\n   Learned Blankness by Anna Salamon\n Martin Seligman coined the term \u0026quot;learned helplessness\u0026quot; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I\u0026rsquo;ll call this \u0026ldquo;learned blankness\u0026rdquo;. Folks who fall prey to learned blankness may still take actions \u0026ndash; sometimes my students practiced the procedures again and again, hired a tutor, etc. But they do so as though carrying out rituals to an unknown god \u0026ndash; parts of them may be trying, but their \u0026ldquo;understand X\u0026rdquo; center has given up.\n   The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books by Cedric Chin\nI'm not sure if all non-fiction books could be adequately categorized by these three labels. Nonetheless, I'm grateful for the vocabulary to describe books I've read that seem like over-stuffed musings on a single idea which would have been better served by a short blog post rather than a book.\n  What is a Career Moat? by Cedric Chin\n A career moat is an individual's ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.\n   The Power of Pomodoros by elharo\n Pomodoros aren\u0026rsquo;t (for me) a means of avoiding procrastination or dividing time among projects. They\u0026rsquo;re a way of blasting through Ugh fields.\n   The Monthly Newsletter as a Thinking Tool by Matt Freeman\nThis post.\n  (a) by Milan Griffes\nI like the idea of including an archive link when linking to off-domain content. It seems like something that could be automated through some \u0026quot;presubmit\u0026quot; step of the publishing process. I've looked around but haven't found an addon/extension for any of the popular blogging solutions which provides an easy way to include such links. I expect that I won't bother to include them so long as I would have to include them manually. The URL to the off-domain content will be present and determined readers will be able to consult archive.org/etc on their own to achieve the same result.\nI also notice that the author includes (sometimes long) relevant quotes from links they cite, or even a long quote and nothing else. I think this is a fantastic practice which accomplishes most of the goal of \u0026quot;(a)\u0026quot;.\n  Meaningful Rest by Neel Nanda\n An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, these lists are basically disjoint!\n  Most situations in my life have a default response, and that takes no effort to follow. To deviate from the default response, I need to spend a scarce resource - willpower. Being tired is essentially being low on willpower, and the problem is that my default actions when low willpower do not regenerate willpower. (I elaborate far more on this model in this post)\n   Productivity by Sam Altman\nThere is a lot of good advice in here. I especially appreciated the point about avoiding productivity porn. \u0026quot;Chasing productivity for its own sake isn't helpful\u0026quot;. I've done that chase before and at best it's a time sink and at worst it's a form of self-deception. As such, I want to be sure to do more than just read the article and then proceed with my life as it was before. I've had more success integrating change gradually and building on small accomplishments as opposed to attempting to overhaul all of my habits at once. I'll try to tackle one piece of advice weekly, of my own highlights from the article, and attempt to work it into my life that week.\n  Noticing the Taste of Lotus by Valentine\nThe idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention. The importance of, and ways to maintain, focus and attention are a common theme in several other articles recently (at least recent to me and my discovery of them).\nThe author's follow-up review of their own writing distinguishes a few claims made in the piece:\n   External forces can shape what we want to do. (I.e., there are lotuses.)\n  It's possible to notice this in real time. (I.e., you can notice the taste of lotuses.)\n  It's good to do so. Otherwise we find our wanting aligned with others' goals regardless of how they relate to our own.\n  If you notice this, you'll find yourself wanting to spit out lotuses that you can tell pull you away from your goals.\n   I like this way of breaking a piece of writing apart into claims. Doing so reminds me of breaking a commit down into small, independent, chunks and all the benefits that come with that practice. There's a balancing act between leveraging links to other, single-purpose, writing throughout a piece and writing a monolithic entry which can be taken as is without further context or external references.\nAs for the claims themselves, I identify with the way the author has phrased claim #3. I find myself at the precipice of rabbit holes regularly with regard to video games. Factorio, for example, is a game that I enjoyed playing so much that I had to cut myself off from it. I would find myself thinking about my factory, and future factories, throughout the day. The optimization problems were enchanting and satisfied a need to accomplish and be productive so well that I dropped a lot of other goals/etc and replaced them, for a time, with Factorio. It's not that Factorio is bad \u0026ndash; it's a fantastic game \u0026ndash; but that I discover, after coming out of the haze of hours and hours of perfecting resource gathering, delivery, and processing, that I've realigned my goals around the game and that those new goals won't take me where I want to go.\n  Attention Is My Most Valuable Asset for Productivity as a Software Developer by Zachary Betz\nI think the author makes a good point. Perhaps I'm less interested than others would be as I've seen these ideas already expressed by Cal Newport.\n  Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger) by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo;; naru is \u0026ldquo;becoming,\u0026rdquo; and the form naritai is \u0026ldquo;want to become.\u0026rdquo; Together it means, \u0026ldquo;I want to become stronger,\u0026rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I\u0026rsquo;ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player\u0026mdash;or after you lose an important match, but you haven\u0026rsquo;t given up\u0026mdash;or after you win an important match, but you\u0026rsquo;re not a ninth-dan player yet\u0026mdash;or after you\u0026rsquo;ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence\n   Something to Protect by Eliezer Yudkowsky\n The Art must have a purpose other than itself, or it collapses into infinite recursion.\n   Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now by Alexy Guzey\n This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing not only helps you to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.\n   Making Yourself Small by Helen\n .. probably the most important thing is your mental/emotional state - a friend suggested \u0026ldquo;not wanting to startle a small bird\u0026rdquo; as an mindset to inhabit, to encourage yourself to become \u0026ldquo;smaller\u0026rdquo;.\n   Seeing the Smoke by Jacob Falkovich\n As Eliezer reminded us, most people sitting alone in a room will quickly get out if it starts filling up with smoke. But if two other people in the room seem unperturbed, almost everyone will stay put. That is the result of a famous experiment from the 1960s and its replications \u0026mdash; people will sit and nervously look around at their peers for 20 minutes even as thick smoke starts obscuring their vision.\n  In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?\nExponential growth is hard for people to grasp. Most people answer \u0026lsquo;24\u0026rsquo; to the above question, or something random like \u0026lsquo;35\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s counter-intuitive to people that the lily pads could be barely noticeable on day 44 and yet completely cover the lake on day 48.\n   Be Impatient by Ben Kuhn\n Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.\n   Attention is your scarcest resource by Ben Kuhn\n \u0026quot;The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:\n\u0026lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.\n10-50% focus: \u0026ldquo;meets expectations,\u0026rdquo; gets regular raises.\n50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.\u0026quot;\nByrne Hobart\n\u0026quot;50%+ focus\u0026quot; is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start habitually asking \u0026quot;how could this go faster?\u0026quot; It\u0026rsquo;s when you get relentlessly resourceful. It\u0026rsquo;s around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or significant other, although that part is avoidable with practice.\nMost importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time\u0026mdash;or zero, in bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it on what matters.\n   ","permalink":"http://cashpw.com/posts/links/","summary":"Links 2021 May   Theory of Change by Aaron Swartz\n A theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action \u0026mdash; it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it.
