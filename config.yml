    Content: |-
      This website contains my personal notes and thoughts. The key component of my notes are the [links which connect them](/posts/evergreennotesshouldbedenselylinked). Links allow forward movement (e.g. A to B). Backlinks allow backward movement (e.g. B to A). These sorts of interconnected notes are sometimes called [zettelkasten](/posts/zettelkasten2021), a second brain, a digital garden. They are a type of [personal knowledge management](/posts/personal_knowledge_management) system.

      I write these notes for myself and share them online as a way of increasing accountability for myself. The public nature of the notes encourages me to [prefer the explicit over the implicit](/posts/be_explicit), to think carefully about my own thoughts and [the way I write](/posts/style_guide).
