In modern programming languages usually use a quoted sequence of characters, formally &amp;ldquo;bracketed delimiters&amp;rdquo;, as in x = &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;. Where &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; is a string literal with value foo.

Notes Kissinger&amp;rsquo;s Diplomacy is a masterful, brilliant and provocative account of world politics and American foreign policy from Cardinal Richelieu to the end of the Cold War. Its title, however is somewhat deceptive, because it is more than just an analysis of the tactics and techniques practiced in the conduct of international diplomacy. Diplomacy is old-fashioned diplomatic history which concentrates on the grand strategy, leadership, and philosophy of the great power relationships.</description></item><item><title>Citations Needed | News Brief: Biden's Dictator Tour and the Tedium of Our Human Rights Concerns Theater</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/86e4a35a-4b5e-4403-946b-737b4dad1693/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 18:27:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/86e4a35a-4b5e-4403-946b-737b4dad1693/</guid><description>Citations Needed, (Citations Needed 2022)

The purpose of the media spin is to provide a narrative for liberals to latch on to which explains why the United States is doing bad things, engaging with bad people, etc.</description></item><item><title>Julia Evans | So You Want to Be a Wizard</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4cb0f7fb-9567-4052-95fa-a57b23a8a54a/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 17:09:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4cb0f7fb-9567-4052-95fa-a57b23a8a54a/</guid><description>Julia Evans, (Evans n.d.)

Summary A discussion of Fully Automated Luxury Communism.
Notes [Della Z Duncan]
And so what about this term, fully automated luxury communism? How might you introduce that to someone who&amp;rsquo;s never heard of the term like, what might you say by way of introduction?
[Eric Wycoff Rogers]
Yeah, I would say essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a position that insists that with the advent of automation, and robotization &amp;ndash; in other words, machines doing much of the work without human assistance or with as little human assistance as possible &amp;ndash; our society should leave most work to robots to produce abundance; that you can get away from a scarcity oriented economy towards an abundance oriented economy, and that we should equitably distribute what&amp;rsquo;s produced in that economic system in some kind of a post capitalist economy where everyone is taken care of no matter what.</description></item><item><title>Adolph Reed Jr | Nothing Left: The Past Is Always Present: Examining Quotidian Life under Jim Crow to Reveal Its Structures</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/26b5b285-6345-4c27-bdd6-26ae906aefdb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 12:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/26b5b285-6345-4c27-bdd6-26ae906aefdb/</guid><description>Adolph Reed, (Reed 2014)

To the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right.

While Danskin hasn&amp;rsquo;t formally proposed solutions or a counter-playbook, I have extracted some ideas from the Alt-right Playbook:
Speak directly to your audience; don&amp;rsquo;t validate terrible ideas by platforming them to your audience or by debating/etc Imagine others complexly Pursue egalitarian policies and structures of governance Prefer the Duck test to believing people at their word</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | Control the Conversation</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/c718f301-2099-48b7-bad5-74fdebea137e/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/c718f301-2099-48b7-bad5-74fdebea137e/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2017)

Summary Broadly, controlling the conversation is about making people talk about what you want them to talk about. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.

Once upon a time, the planet was tyrannised by a giant dragon. The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived.</description></item><item><title>James F.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;.

Summary Thoughts Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense.

But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company&amp;rsquo;s culture.

One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.</description></item><item><title>Eliezer Yudkowsky | The Fallacy of Gray</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/0c317a9b-c62b-418b-a78f-2543944dd8bc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/0c317a9b-c62b-418b-a78f-2543944dd8bc/</guid><description>Eliezer Yudkowsky, (Yudkowsky n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes The Sophisticate: &amp;ldquo;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It&amp;rsquo;s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.&amp;rdquo;
The Zetet: &amp;ldquo;Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view&amp;rdquo;
—Marc Stiegler, David&amp;rsquo;s Sling

All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Five Sentences</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ef3d7a17-747d-485c-83b3-4404c1ab67e8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:21:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ef3d7a17-747d-485c-83b3-4404c1ab67e8/</guid><description> The Problem
E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

Summary Thoughts Notes The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.
Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo;; naru is &amp;ldquo;becoming,&amp;rdquo; and the form naritai is &amp;ldquo;want to become.&amp;rdquo; Together it means, &amp;ldquo;I want to become stronger,&amp;rdquo; and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | To Get Good, Go After The Metagame</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4f9769a8-94c3-461c-b4be-933b522aab15/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2020)

Thoughts Notes Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called &amp;lsquo;the meta&amp;rsquo;.
Every sufficiently interesting domain in the world has a meta associated with it.
What is interesting about the meta is that metagames can only be played if you have mastered the basics of the domain.</description></item><item><title>Cedric Chin | The Three Kinds of Non-Fiction Books</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ee7ed2c5-dd15-42aa-8cfe-8149ce58473e/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 07:36:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ee7ed2c5-dd15-42aa-8cfe-8149ce58473e/</guid><description>Cedric Chin, (Chin 2018)

Summary Thoughts This reminds me of a way of conceptualizing a &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; programmer (though I no longer recall where I read the idea): 10x programmers are not 10x because they code/write/etc 10x faster; they&amp;rsquo;re 10x because they solve the big problems that a non-10x programmer cannot solve.

Summary Socratic grilling is &amp;ldquo;like Socratic questioning, but a little harsher and more confrontational in order to get to the point more quickly&amp;rdquo; (Alexander 2020). Scott Alexander encourages leaning in to such conversations without shutting them down with an &amp;ldquo;I know more than you do&amp;rdquo;- or &amp;ldquo;Just because&amp;rdquo;-type responses.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about &amp;ldquo;lotus-eating&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of &amp;ldquo;lotus-eaters&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin | My least favorite Git commit</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/89fb44ee-8994-4c6c-89db-bc210039a39b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/89fb44ee-8994-4c6c-89db-bc210039a39b/</guid><description>Alexey Nikitin, (Nikitin 2019)

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.</description></item><item><title>Neel Nanda | Meaningful Rest</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/670eb58e-6802-4b6e-8f16-ce2e40276513/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/670eb58e-6802-4b6e-8f16-ce2e40276513/</guid><description>Neel Nanda, (Nanda n.d.)
Create concept post for the idea of engaging in meaningful rest Summary Thoughts Notes An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.

Summary The most important traits that you need to have in order to step up in your career are: not settling with mediocrity, having an open mindset, being humble, learning from your mistakes, working on the challenging problems and having an opportunity mindset rather than a complaining one.

Summary Thoughts Notes Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a &amp;ldquo;fear of success&amp;rdquo;; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you&amp;rsquo;re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can! But most of the habits we have are habits we ended up with after years of unconscious behavior.</description></item><item><title>Anna Salamon | Learned Blankness</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/8589981c-2ef6-46ed-b197-bb8acbece4ec/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:49:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/8589981c-2ef6-46ed-b197-bb8acbece4ec/</guid><description>Anna Salamon, (Salamon 2011)
Summary Thoughts Notes Martin Seligman coined the term &amp;ldquo;learned helplessness&amp;rdquo; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/4737f7a9-faec-4d2c-a901-227495ab0373/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching&amp;rsquo; [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the &amp;lsquo;recognition-primed decision making&amp;rsquo; model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashpw.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashpw.com/posts/ff009594-d69f-4d33-b0c2-65ed62eaf0b2/</guid><description> [&amp;hellip;] a classical adage and oxymoron meaning &amp;ldquo;make haste slowly&amp;rdquo; (sometimes rendered in English as &amp;ldquo;more haste, less speed&amp;rdquo;).
