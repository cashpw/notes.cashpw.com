TODO Summary TODO Thoughts TODO Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it’s crucial to understand the context around your software, I’m happiest when that context is other people’s software.
The second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Senior Engineers Reduce Risk</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)
TODO Summary TODO Thoughts TODO Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, “risk” is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn’t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company’s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | And Yet It Moves</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/itmoves2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/itmoves2022/</guid><description>(“And yet It Moves” 2022)
&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse. In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church&amp;rsquo;s proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa).</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Thought Leaders and Chicken Sexers</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanthoughtleaderschickensexers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanthoughtleaderschickensexers/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)

Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Deep Time</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:07:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/deeptime2021/</guid><description>(“Deep Time” 2021)

All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth.</description></item><item><title>Five Sentences</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/fivesentences/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:21:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/fivesentences/</guid><description>(“Five Sentences” n.d.)
The Problem
E-mail takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.
The Solution
Treat all email responses like SMS text messages, using a set number of letters per response. Since it’s too hard to count letters, we count sentences instead.

The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.

Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese.

It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin | My least favorite Git commit</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nikitinmyleastfavoritegitcommit2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nikitinmyleastfavoritegitcommit2019/</guid><description>Alexey Nikitin, (Nikitin 2019)

Summary Thoughts Notes The easiest, very high ROI step is to simply open up a new Evernote document on the first of each month and title it &amp;ldquo;February 2018 Update&amp;rdquo; or whatever. Then just try to keep that tab open. You&amp;rsquo;ll find stuff to put in there. What I end up writing generally falls into a small number of categories:

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them.</description></item><item><title>Neel Nanda | Meaningful Rest</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nandameaningfulrest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:52:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nandameaningfulrest/</guid><description>Neel Nanda, (Nanda n.d.)
TODO Summary TODO Thoughts Notes An exercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list the things you want to do when you feel tired and low-energy. Then, set another 5 minute timer, and list the things you feel rejuvenated after having done - the things you like doing when low-energy.

Summary The most important traits that you need to have in order to step up in your career are: not settling with mediocrity, having an open mindset, being humble, learning from your mistakes, working on the challenging problems and having an opportunity mindset rather than a complaining one.

Summary Thoughts Notes Why will a randomly chosen eight-year-old fail a calculus test? Because most possible answers are wrong, and there is no force to guide him to the correct answers. (There is no need to postulate a “fear of success”; most ways writing or not writing on a calculus test constitute failure, and so people, and rocks, fail calculus tests by default.)

Habits are always forming. No matter what you do, you’re also forming habits too. Keep that in mind with whatever you do.
When we talk about habits, we generally talk about learning good habits. Or forming good habits. Both of these outcomes suggest we can end up with the habits we want. And technically we can! But most of the habits we have are habits we ended up with after years of unconscious behavior.</description></item><item><title>Anna Salamon | Learned Blankness</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/annasalamonlearnedblankness2011/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:49:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/annasalamonlearnedblankness2011/</guid><description>Anna Salamon, (Salamon 2011)
Summary Thoughts Notes Martin Seligman coined the term &amp;ldquo;learned helplessness&amp;rdquo; to describe a condition in which someone has learned to behave as though they were helpless. I think we need a term for learned helplessness about thinking (in a particular domain). I’ll call this “learned blankness”.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people. You can measure it by the product of the number of people for which your points matter and how much it matters to those people.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | For, Then Against, High-Saturated-Fat Diets</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexanderthenhighsaturatedfatdiets2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 17:33:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexanderthenhighsaturatedfatdiets2020/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (Alexander 2020)

Summary Expertise is just pattern matching. In other words, being an expert at something is equivalent to being really good at (1) recognizing situations and (2) knowing how to respond to those situations. Simple, right?
Notes [&amp;hellip;] the notion that &amp;lsquo;expertise is simply pattern-matching’ [&amp;hellip;] follows naturally from two other ideas that I’ve covered extensively on Commonplace over the past year.
The first idea is the ‘recognition-primed decision making’ model developed by psychologist Gary Klein and his collaborators, working in the US military and with expert firefighters and NICU nurses.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Festina Lente</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/festinalente2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/festinalente2022/</guid><description>(“Festina Lente” 2022)

A desirable difficulty is a learning task that requires a considerable but desirable amount of effort, thereby improving long-term performance.
Examples include:
Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards) Spacing and interleaving (eg: Spaced Repetition) To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval. The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing during practice.</description></item><item><title>Dan Moore | Cultivate the Skill of Undivided Attention, or "Deep Work"</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mooredscultivateskillundividedattentiondeepwork2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/mooredscultivateskillundividedattentiondeepwork2019/</guid><description>Dan Moore, (NO_ITEM_DATA:mooredsCultivateSkillUndividedAttentionDeepWork2019)

Summary Thoughts Notes A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live.
