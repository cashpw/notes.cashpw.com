Quotes The Shorter and Plainer the Better Use The Smallest Word That Does The Job If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written A Shorter Letter</description></item><item><title>Write Prolifically; Write Succinctly</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/write_prolifically_write_succinctly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:28:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/write_prolifically_write_succinctly/</guid><description>Summary Notes That is: write more things, but have each thing be shorter. This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
