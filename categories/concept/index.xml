the function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams), and the function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different shade of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.

This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Permastore</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/permastore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 12:05:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/permastore/</guid><description>Extremely long-term or lasting memory which forms following extensive training, learning, or experience.

&amp;hellip; [R]elational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other.

Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.

Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.
