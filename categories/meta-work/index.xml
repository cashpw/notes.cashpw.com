&amp;hellip;
[H]ighly productive developers (10x or otherwise) are problem-solving at a much higher level. Their productivity won’t be apparent from a narrow test, any more than the overall skill of a world-class football player would be apparent from (say) how fast they could run the 100m dash.
The most productive developers are solving big problems, and are bringing judgment and experience to bear on essential design, architecture, and “build vs use existing library” decisions.</description></item><item><title>Attention is Your Scarcest Resource</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/attention_is_your_scarcest_resource/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 11:46:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/attention_is_your_scarcest_resource/</guid><description>As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech partner to give me API documentation—I’d let myself stay stuck instead of sliding off to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less efficient, because I’d spend less time programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling.</description></item><item><title>Productivity Notes from Sam Altman</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/productivity_notes_from_sam_altman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 08:43:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/productivity_notes_from_sam_altman/</guid><description>Notes It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.
The most impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in the general population. If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
I make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.</description></item></channel></rss>
