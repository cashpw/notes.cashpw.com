<p>Catch up on flashcard review backlog</p>
<p>I have &gt;200 outstanding flashcards. Reviewing them all at once wouldn&rsquo;t just hurt now, it would hurt forever as from time to time I&rsquo;d see a similarly-sized spike of due flashcards. I&rsquo;ll do 30<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> minutes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of review daily to bring the count down.</p>
<p>This is important as I want to review new flashcards soon after creating them. Creating a flashcard on Monday and first seeing it in review on the following Monday is a poor learning experience. I&rsquo;m holding off on creating new flashcards until I get through the backlog.</p>

<p>I selected 30 minutes since I think I&rsquo;d be able to keep it up indefinitely. Some variation is okay but I don&rsquo;t want to get to the point that I need to review cards for 1-2 hours daily.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

This month Created flashcards for all existing notes
One of the reasons Why I write notes is to remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. In the past, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t diligent about creating flashcards when adding a new note. As a result, there were hundreds of notes with missing or inadequate flashcards. My main goal for this month was to fill in the gaps and I succeeded!</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/671006e6-3f41-4c37-9840-1a0a1c3f2496/">Monthly newsletter</a> for November, 2022.</p>

<p>I have &gt;400 outstanding flashcards. Reviewing them all at once wouldn&rsquo;t just hurt now, it would hurt forever as from time to time I&rsquo;d see a similarly-sized spike of due flashcards. I&rsquo;ll do 50-100 per day to spread them out.</p>
