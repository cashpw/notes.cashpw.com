This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramics Exercises</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_exercises/</guid><description>Throw/form as much as possible.
Throw repeatedly for consistency: Throw 10/25/50/100/&amp;hellip; of the same form (eg: a mug) from the same amount of clay and attempt to form them as consistently as you can. Compare them afterward, note differences, and consider what you can do to improve your consistency. Throw repeatedly for creativity: Throw 10/25/50/100/&amp;hellip; different variations on the same form (eg: a vase). This exercise is about pushing yourself to be creative and explore the form you&amp;rsquo;re throwing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramists/Potters I Follow</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists_potters_i_follow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 22:39:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists_potters_i_follow/</guid><description> Florian Gadsby Bill van Gilder Dear Ali Hsinchuen Lin Shinobu Hashimoto Earth Nation Ceramics Lilly Maetzig Ingleton Pottery</description></item><item><title>Ceramics/Pottery Resources</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_pottery_resources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 20:16:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramics_pottery_resources/</guid><description>Learn Classes Understanding Pottery Series Books A Potter&amp;rsquo;s Workbook Mastering The Potter&amp;rsquo;s Wheel Community Conferences National Council on Education for the Ceramics Arts (NCECA), WatchNCECA Material Stores clay-king.net Tools Kanna DIY Chattering Tools Pottery Tool - DIY Hacksaw Blade Trim Tool 382.

This exercise helps me identify what is important in the near future, think about how best to achieve it, and help myself see progress toward where I want to be in my life. Last year wrote out 13 goals for 2021. Unfortunately, I wrote them quickly and they fell out of my mind about as fast. That said, I did make some progress the writing/reading goals by virtue of getting blog system together.</description></item><item><title>README</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:32:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/readme/</guid><description>The purpose of this README is to explain some of the details in this collection of content.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.
Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.
Why Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.
I expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment.</description></item></channel></rss>
