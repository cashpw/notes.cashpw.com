This has a few key benefits.
First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier. People are busy, and generally don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend on any one thing.</description></item><item><title>Ceramists/Potters I Follow</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists_potters_i_follow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 22:39:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ceramists_potters_i_follow/</guid><description> Florian Gadsby Bill van Gilder Dear Ali Hsinchuen Lin Shinobu Hashimoto Earth Nation Ceramics Lilly Maetzig Ingleton Pottery</description></item><item><title>Goals for 2022</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 13:34:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2022/</guid><description>I like to start the year by writing a list of goals for myself. This exercise helps me identify what is important in the near future, think about how best to achieve it, and help myself see progress toward where I want to be in my life. Last year wrote out 13 goals for 2021. Unfortunately, I wrote them quickly and they fell out of my mind about as fast. That said, I did make some progress the writing/reading goals by virtue of getting blog system together.</description></item><item><title>README</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:32:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/readme/</guid><description>The purpose of this README is to explain some of the details in this collection of content.

This was the thought that pulled me into attempting a polyphasic sleep schedule.
Note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep good notes while I was researching the intricacies of polyphasic sleep. There will be quite a few uncited claims.
Why Change My Sleep Schedule? In short: to live longer.
I expect to live for another 50.4 years1. I was getting an average of nine hours of sleep every night prior to stating this experiment.</description></item><item><title>Goals for 2021</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 13:04:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/goals_for_2021/</guid><description>The unexamined life is not worth living, man.
These are vague goals, in no particular order, for myself in 2021. I think it would be helpful to break them down into shorter-term and specific goals. That&amp;rsquo;ll come later. For now&amp;hellip;
Give more time to the people in my life. Keep in touch with friends. Learn my working limit and respect it. Become more comfortable sitting quietly in a room alone.</description></item></channel></rss>
