You can&amp;rsquo;t finish it, ever. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is a problem you need to solve. It means it&amp;rsquo;s a selection to taste from.

I have, and I called it &amp;ldquo;info gorging&amp;rdquo;, and I would occasionally indulge in it.

<p>I have, and I called it &ldquo;info gorging&rdquo;, and I would occasionally indulge in it. But the problem is that you don&rsquo;t fully integrate what you&rsquo;ve seen with what you know or believe. At best, you&rsquo;ve accumulated a set of superficial ideas to be fleshed out later. At worst, you&rsquo;ve given yourself a feeling of preemptive failure, looking at all the things you could do, and yet not doing them.</p>
<p>&gt;Btw. you could say, just turn off the Internet and buy a book, but can you really pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist? And how long can you stick to it?</p>
<p>Old fashioned discipline starts in the mind. You must be ruthless with yourself, and make a determination: I&rsquo;m reading this book, and if I&rsquo;m not doing that, then I&rsquo;m staring into space. There is no third option, no fidget spinner, no screen, not even useful distractions like cleaning. If you accept your wayward thoughts, but not indulge them, they will pass.</p>
<p>In many ways, information is like fast food in that it can overstimulate you, yet leave you wanting more. There is no other way out of this cycle than to acknowledge this condition and cut yourself off. You need strong faith in yourself and in the wisdom of the path you&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>

Last year, I had a conversation that changed my life.<br />
<br />
It caused me to upend everything and move across the country.<br />
<br />
The lesson from it may change yours: ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-2"></span>
I was out for a drink with a friend.<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ll call him George.<br />
<br />
As we settled in, George asked about my life and how I was feeling.<br />
<br />
At first, I gave him the standard response that we&rsquo;ve all grown so accustomed to:<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good. Busy!&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared blankly through my empty words. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-3"></span>
Feeling the pressure of his gaze, I adjusted myself and added that living in California had begun to wear on me, it being so far from my parents on the East Coast.<br />
<br />
I had been 3,000 miles away for the last 12 years.<br />
<br />
And with the path I was on, there was no end in sight. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-4"></span>
The moment of vulnerability sparked an interaction that changed my life:<br />
<br />
George: &ldquo;How often do you see your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &ldquo;Maybe once a year now.&quot;<br />
<br />
George: &ldquo;And how old are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &ldquo;Mid-sixties.&quot;<br />

Gut punch.<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
It wasn&rsquo;t meant to be rude&mdash;it was just&hellip;math.<br />
<br />
If the average life expectancy is ~80 years, my parents are in their mid-60s, and I see them one time per year, the math&mdash;however depressing&mdash;says I will see them 15 more times before they are gone. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-6"></span>
Our time together is finite, but we often fail to recognize it until it&rsquo;s too late.<br />
<br />
Time is cruel.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll love it with all of your being&mdash;you may even pray for more of it&mdash;but time doesn&rsquo;t care about you.<br />
<br />
Your relationship with time is the ultimate unrequited love. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-7"></span>
The morning after this conversation, my wife and I had a very candid conversation about what we wanted in life.<br />
<br />
A few days later, we listed our house in California on the market, packed up our things, and shipped off to the East Coast to be closer to our parents. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-8"></span>
It&rsquo;s been over a year since the conversation that changed my life.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll never regret these tiny moments&mdash;of doing nothing in particular&mdash;that we&rsquo;ll spend together in the years ahead.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll never regret the moments my parents get to spend with my son.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll never regret any of it. [[<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NGesWAAQF14Q.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NGesWAAQF14Q.jpg</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NGesWAAQF14Q.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)]] ^{//}</p>

My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@waitbutwhy</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) wrote about this &ldquo;Parent Time&rdquo; phenomenon in a recent New York Times op-ed.<br />
<br />
In classic fashion, he produced a striking visualization to capture the sentiment.<br />
<br />
It brings one takeaway to life: Our time with our loved ones is so limited and precious. [[<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NG6BWQAQvD-n.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NG6BWQAQvD-n.jpg</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fc3NG6BWQAQvD-n.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)]] ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-10"></span>
All of this math&mdash;depressing as it seems&mdash;should be a call to arms.<br />
<br />
Identify the people and activities you care most deeply about. Prioritize them ruthlessly.<br />
<br />
It may be difficult&mdash;even painful&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a decision you&rsquo;ll never regret. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-11"></span>
We spend most of our lives playing a game:<br />
<br />
Everything we do is in anticipation of the future. When that future comes, we simply reset to the next one.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I&rsquo;m 18 so I can [X].&quot;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I&rsquo;m 25 so I can [Y].&quot;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until I&rsquo;m 45 so I can [Z].&rdquo; ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-12"></span>
It&rsquo;s natural, but it&rsquo;s a dangerous game&mdash;one that we will lose, eventually.<br />
<br />
Time is our most precious asset and the present is all that&rsquo;s guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Spend it wisely, with those you love, in ways you&rsquo;ll never regret. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-13"></span>
Always remember the famous song by Guy Lombardo:<br />
<br />
Enjoy yourself, it&rsquo;s later than you think.<br />
Enjoy yourself, while you&rsquo;re still in the pink.<br />
The years go by, as quickly as a wink.<br />
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it&rsquo;s later than you think. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-14"></span>
I hope this thread sparks some of you to have conversations with your loved ones about time (and who you want to spend yours with).<br />

By the way, the point of this thread isn&rsquo;t saying that any decision about where to live is <strong>right</strong> or <strong>wrong</strong>.<br />
<br />
My goal is to emphasize the precious nature of time and spark active discussion with you and your loved ones about the tradeoffs and decisions that this creates. ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-17"></span>
We all have to reach our own conclusions.<br />
<br />
These are often very challenging decisions with a variety of complex tradeoffs.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, as an observation, I do think fewer people regret making the decision to live close to family later in life (vs. the alternative). ^{//}</p>
<p><span class="org-target" id="org-target--tweet-18"></span>
I&rsquo;d expect that in a future where remote/hybrid work becomes the norm, these decisions become easier to make.<br />
<br />
In this future, the career limiting fears that previously held back many would-be movers may wane.<br />
<br />
Something for companies considering employee happiness to consider. ^{//}</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional approach to learning is to define the objectives (the gap between the knowledge a person has and the knowledge the person needs to perform the task), establish the regimen for practice, and provide feedback. Learning procedures and factual data is seen as adding more information and skills to the person&rsquo;s storehouse of knowledge. However, this storehouse metaphor is poorly suited for cognitive skill, and does not address the differing learning needs of novices and experts. Teaching cognitive skills requires the diagnosis of the problem in terms of flaws in existing mental models, not gaps in knowledge. It requires learning objectives that are linked to the person&rsquo;s current mental models. It requires practice regimens that may have to result in &ldquo;unlearning&rdquo; that enables the person to abandon the current, flawed mental models. It requires feedback that promotes sensemaking [<a href="/posts/10a23a67-c60d-4591-8bb2-e87ca50b0e94/">Sensemaking</a>]. We propose a Cognitive Transformation Theory to guide the development of cognitive skills. Finally, we present several strategies that might be useful in overcoming barriers to understanding and to revising mental models. Finally, we show the implications of Cognitive Transformation Theory for using virtual environments (VEs; where a &ldquo;live&rdquo; student interacts with a &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; environment) in training.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How can cognitive skills be improved? The conventional mechanisms of practice, feedback, and accumulation of knowledge rarely apply to cognitive skills in the same way they apply to behavioral skills. In this chapter we argue that cognitive learning requires a different concept of the learning process.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to learning seem clear-cut:</p>
<ol>
<li>identify what you want the student to learn</li>
<li>provide the knowledge and present an opportunity to practice the skill or concept</li>
<li>give feedback so the student can gauge whether the learning has succeeded. Educating students in behavioral skills appears to simply be a matter of practice and feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach to learning relies on a storehouse metaphor. It assumes the learner is missing some critical form of konwledge &mdash; factual information or procedures. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>We believe that this storehouse metaphor is insufficient to describe learning of cognitive skills. [&hellip;] We can distinguish different forms of knowledge that people need in order to gain expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>declarative knowledge</li>
<li>routines and procedures</li>
<li>recognition of familiar patterns</li>
<li>perceptual discrimination skills</li>
<li>mental models</li>
</ul>
<p>The storehouse metaphor seems best suited for acquiring declarative knowledge and for learning new routines/procedures. It may be less apt for building pattern-recognition skills. It is least appropriate for teaching people to make perceptual discriminations and for improving the quality of their mental models.</p>
<p>When people build a larger repertoire of patterns and prototypes, they are not simply adding new items to their lists. They are learning how to categorize the new items and are changing categories and redefining the patterns and prototypes as they gain new experience. The storehouse metaphor implies a simple additive process, which would lead to confusion rather than to growth. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>When people develop perceptual discrimination skills [&hellip;] they are learning to make distinctions that they did previously did not notice. They are learning to &ldquo;see the invisible&rdquo; [<a href="/posts/4eec9434-56e8-4b63-80fc-8bb9150fc6be/">Gary A. Klein and Robert R. Hoffman | Seeing the Invisible: Perceptual-cognitive Aspects of Expertise</a>] in the sense that they can now make discriminations they previously did not notice. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Cognitive skills depend heavily on mental models [<a href="/posts/787214e0-5941-4c6f-9a61-e79b9b40baea/">Mental model</a>]. We define a mental model as a cluster of causal beliefs about how things happen. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Cognitive learning is not simply a matter of adding additional beliefs into the existing mental models. Rather, we have to revise our belief systems and our mental models as experience shows the inadequacy of our current ways of thinking. [&hellip;]</p>

<h3 id="sensemaking-requirements-for-learning-cognitive-skills">Sensemaking requirements for learning cognitive skills</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We treat cognitive learning as a sensemaking [<a href="/posts/10a23a67-c60d-4591-8bb2-e87ca50b0e94/">Sensemaking</a>] activity that includes four components:</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Diagnosing the reasons for weak performance depends on sensemaking. The instructor, whether in person or viitual, has to ferret out the reasons why the student is confused and making errors. Sometimes trainees do not even notice errors or weaknesses and may resist suggestions to overcome problems they do not realize they have. Even if trainees do realize something is wrong, the cause/effect mechanisms are subtle and complex. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>The goal of diagnosis goes beyond establishing learning objectives—it depends on discovering what flaw in a mental model needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>For cognitive skills, it is very difficult to determine and define the existing problem. Cognitive Task Analysis [<a href="/posts/bd9daffc-f556-4bdc-975e-e35c3c98ebee/">Cognitive task analysis</a>] methods may be needed to diagnose subtle aspects of cognitive skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] for cognitive learning, the objectives may be to help the students revise their mental models and perhaps to reorganize the way they categorize events. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>We further assert that novices may not have mental models for an unfamiliar domain and will struggle to formulate even rudimentary mental models linking causes to effects. Their learning objective is to employ sensemaking to generate initial menta lmodels of cause/effect stories, whereas experts are revising and adding to current mental models.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="practice">Practice</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Providing students with practice is necessary for gaining proficiency. But with cognitive skills, practice is not sufficient. For cognitive skills, trainees often may not know what they should be watching and monitoring. They need adequate mental models to direct their attention, but until they get smarter, they may fail to spot the cues that will help them develop better mental models.</p>
<p>[Virtual environments] [(simulations)] can help trainees gain this needed practice in a context that allows them to budli more robust mental models. [&hellip;] VE training [&hellip;] surpassed real world training [with sufficient exporure to virtual training environments].</p>
<p>Managing attention depends on sensemaking. Feedback will not be useful if the trainee does not notice or understand it &mdash; and that requires the trainee to know what to attend to and when to shift attention. Barrett, Tugade, and Engle (2004) have suggested that attention management accounts for many of the individual differences in working memory &mdash; the ability to focus attention and not be distracted by irrelevancies. For these reasons, we argue that effective practice, whether in actual or in virtual environments, depends on attention management: seeking information &mdash; knowing what to seek and when to seek it &mdash; and filtering distracting data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="feedback">Feedback</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Providing students with feedback will not be useful if they do not understand it. For complex cognitive skills, such as leadership, time lags between actions and consequences will create difficulties in sorting out what worked, what did not work, and why. Learners need to engage in sensemaking to discover cause-effect relationships between actions taken at time one and the effects seen at time two. To make things more complicated, learners often have to account for other actions and events that are interspersed between their actions and the consequences, They have to figure out what really caused the consequences versus the coincidental events that had nothing to do with their actions. They have to understand the causes versus the symptoms of deeper causes, and they have to sort out what just happened, the factors in play, the influence of these factors, and the time lags for the effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>To add to these complications, having an instructor or training tool provide feedback can actually get in the way of transfer of learning (Schmidt &amp; Wulf, 1997) even though it increases the learning curve during acquisition. By placing Students in an environment where they are given rapid feedback, the students are not compelled to develop skills for seeking their own feedback. Further, students may become distracted from intrinsic feedback because it is so much easier to rely on the extrinsic feedback. As a result, when they complete what they set out to learn, they are not prepared to seek and interpret their own feedback.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for cognitive learning is to handle time lags between actions and consequences. VE sessions will compress these time lags, which might clarify relationships but will also reduce the opportunity to learn how to interpret delayed feedback. To compensate, VE sessions could add distracters that might have potentially caused the effects as a way to sustain confusion about how to interpret feedback. In addition, VE sessions could be structured to monitor how people interpret the feedback.</p>
<p>For cognitive learning, one of the complications facing instructional designers is that the flawed mental models of the students act as a barrier to learning. Students need to have better mental models in order to understand the feedback that would invalidate their existing mental models. Without a good mental model, students will have trouble making &lsquo;use of feedback, but without useful feedback, students will not be able to develop good mental models. That is why cognitive learning may depend on unlearning as well as learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-process-of-unlearning">The process of unlearning</h3>
<p><a href="/posts/b1803fd2-0e85-4a69-b4c9-3516194b7442/">You must unlearn what you have learned</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For people to develop better mental models they may have to untearh some of their existing mental models. The reason is that as people gain experience, their understanding of a domain should become more complex and nuanced. The mental models that provided a rough approximation need to be replaced by more sophisticated ones. But people may be reluctant to abandon inadequate mental models, as they may not appreciate the inadequacies. They may attempt to explain away the inconsistencies and anomalies.</p>
<p>Chinn and Brewer (1993) showed that scientists and science students alike deflected inconvenient data. They identified seven reactions to anomalous data that were inconsistent with a mental model:</p>
<ol>
<li>ignoring the data</li>
<li>rejecting the data</li>
<li>finding a way to exclude the data from an evaluation of the theory/model</li>
<li>holding the data in abeyance</li>
<li>reinterpreting the data while retaining the theory/model</li>
<li>reinterpreting the data and making peripheral changes to the theory/model</li>
<li>accepting the data and revising the theory/model</li>
</ol>
<p>Only this last reaction changes the core beliefs. The others involve ways to discount the data and preserve the theory.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] Sensemaking here is a deliberate activity to discover what is wrong with one&rsquo;s mental models and to abandon and replace them.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;] &ldquo;Organizations&rsquo; resistance to dramatic reorientations creates a need for explicit unlearning &hellip; Before attempting radical changes, [organizations] must dismantle parts of their current ideological and political structures. Before they will contemplate dramatically different procedures, policies, and strategies, they must lose confidence in their current procedures, policies, strategies, and top managers&rdquo; (p. 339). We believe that these observations apply to individuals as well as to organizations and that the concept of unlearning needs to become part of a cognitive learning regimen.</p>
<p>Just like organizations, individuals also resist changing their mental models. Chinn and Brewer (1993) refer to Kuhn&rsquo;s (1962) research to suggest that students will be more likely to abandon a flawed set of beliefs if they have an alternative theory/model available. This method may work best when the alternative model is already part of the students' repertoire. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>However, in some situations we suspect that the reverse has to happen. People have to lose confidence in their models before they will seriously consider an alternate. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Scott, Asoko, and Driver (1991) have described two broad types of strategies for producing conceptual change: creating cognitive conflict and building on existing ideas as analogies. The DiBello and Schmitt approaches fit within the first grouping, to create cognitive conflict. The Brown and Clement work exemplifies the second—introducing analogs as platforms for new ideas.</p>
<p>Chinn and Brewer (1993) have also suggested that asking students to justify their models will facilitate their readiness to change models in the face of anomalous data.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>People have to diagnose their performance problems, manage their attention, appreciate the implications of feedback, and formulate better mental models by uniearning inadequate models. Learners are not simply accumulating more knowledge into a storehouse. They are changing their perspectives on the world.</p>

<h3 id="cognitive-transformation-theory">Cognitive transformation theory</h3>
<p>Cognitive transformation theory is the idea that &ldquo;progress in cognitive skills depends on successively shedding outmoded sets of beliefs and adopting new beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our central claim is that conceptual learning is discontinuous rather than smooth. We make periodic advances when we replace flawed mental models with better ones. However, during the process of cognitive development our mental models get harder to disconfirm. As we move up the learning curve or have more expertise, we have to put more energy into unlearning &mdash; discomfirming mental models &mdash; in order to accept better ones.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>We can represent cognitive transformation theory as a set of postulates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental models are central to cognitive learning</strong></p>
<p>Instruction needs to diagnose limitations in mental models, design interventions to help students appreciate the flaws in their mental models, and provide experiences to enable trainees to discover more useful and accurate mental models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental models are modular</strong></p>
<p>People have a variety of fragmentary mental models, and they weave those together to account for a novel observation. People are usually not matching events to sophisticated theories they have in memory. They are using fragments and partial beliefs to construct relevant mental models. For most domains, the central mental models describe causal relationships. They describe how events transform into later events. Causal mental models typically take the form of a story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experts have more sophisticated mental models in their domains of practice than novices</strong></p>
<p>Experts have more of the fragmentary beliefs needed to construct a plausible mental model. Therefore, they are starting their construction from a more advanced position. Finally, experts have more accurate causal mental models and have tested and abandoned more inadequate beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experts build their repertoires of fragmentary mental models in a discontinuous fashion</strong></p>
<p>In using their mental models, even experts may distort data, oversimplify, explain away diagnostic information, and misunderstand events. At some point, experts realize the inadequacies of their mental models. They abandon their existing mental models and replace these with a better set of causal beliefs. And the cycle begins again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning curves are usually smooth because researchers combine data from several subjects</strong></p>
<p>The reason for the smoothness is the averaging of discontinuous curves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experts are fallible</strong></p>
<p>No set of mental models is entirely accurate and complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge shields are the set of arguments learners can use to explain away data that challenge their mental models</strong></p>
<p>Knowledge shields pose a barrier to developing cognitive skills. People are skilled at holding onto cherished beliefs. The better the mental models, the easier it is to find flaws in disconfirming evidence and anomalous observations. The S-shaped learning curve reflects the increasing difficulty of replacing mental models as people&rsquo;s mental models become more accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge shields affect diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Active learners try to overcome their limitations, but they need to understand what those limitations are. Knowledge shields based on poor mental models can lead learners to the wrong diagnoses of their poor performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge shields affect feedback</strong></p>
<p>In building mental models about complex situations, people receive a lot of feedback. However, the knowledge shields enable people to discard or neutralize contradictory data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progress depends on unlearning</strong></p>
<p>The better the causal models, the more difficult it is to discover their weaknesses and replace them. In many cases, learners have to encounter a baffling event, an unmistakable anomaly, or an intelligent failure in order to begin doubting their mental models. They have to lose faith in their existing mental models before they can review the pattern of evidence and formulate a better mental model. People can improve their mental models by continually elaborating them, by replacing them with better ones, and/or by unlearning their current mental models. Cognitive development relies on all three processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual differences in attitudes toward cognitive conflict will affect success in conceptual change</strong></p>
<p>Dreyfus, Jungwirth, and Eliovitch (1990) noted that bright and successful students responded positively to anomalies, whereas unsuccessful students tended to avoid the conflicts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[emphasis and formatting mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="implications-for-virtual-environments">Implications for virtual environments</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] virtual environments allow for both intrinsic and extrinsic feedback. Many simulations offer scoring or an after action review capability that allows learners to see how they did in comparison to other students or some set standard. More important than the extrinsic feedback, these virtual environments give learners the ability to see how their actions play out and the challenges they may run into based on their mental models, allowing for self-assessment, adjustment, and improvement in cognitive learning.</p>
<p>Because cognitive learning depends heavily on sensemaking [<a href="/posts/10a23a67-c60d-4591-8bb2-e87ca50b0e94/">Sensemaking</a>], and sensemaking is often complicated by knowledge shields, virtual environment sessions might benefit from designs using garden path [<a href="/posts/18375047-41ab-49a0-96d3-6ac554685fc2/">Garden path</a>] scenarios that elicit knowledge shields and give learners a chance to recover from mistaken mindsets and get off the garden path. In a garden path scenario a parson is lead to accept a proposition that seems obviously true and is then given increasing amounts of contrary evidence gradually leading to the realization that the initial proposition is wrong. The paradigm lets us study how long it takes for participants to doubt and then reject the initial proposition &mdash; how long they stay on the garden path.</p>

<p>Kiki quickly got the hang of flying. But as she grew older, she often found herself distracted by all sorts of things &quot; for example, the big pimples that started appearing on the sides of her nose, or deciding which dress she should wear to her friend&rsquo;s birthday party.</p>
<p>Whenever that happened, her broom would suddenly start to fall. One time she was so busy thinking about the scratchy new underwear she was wearing that she ran into a power line! Her broom broke into pieces, and Kiki herself ended up with bumps on her nose and both kneecaps.</p>
<p>Soon after, Kokiri tied bells to the tall trees of the forest. If Kiki was lost in thought and flying too low, her feet would ring the bells and the sound would bring her back to reality. Fortunately, they were ringing much less than they used to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the sneeze-medicine-making, but Kiki didn&rsquo;t seem to be cut out for it. She was impatient and found it difficult to grow the herbs, finely chop the leaves and roots, and slowly simmer them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will another type of magic disappear?&rdquo; Kokiri lamented. In the olden days, witches could use all sorts of magic. But over the years, one type after another disappeared, until even a genuine witch like Kokiri was left with only two abilities. Now her daughter hated one of them, so it was no wonder she was upset.</p>

<p><strong>Place a mirror</strong> in front of the wheel to reflect the wheel head. This is an invaluable aid when studying hand positions; it also makes it easier to compare them with photos when using a book as a guide. This process is also useful for viewing the pot as it is being made on the wheel, since it abolishes the necessiyt for the potter to step back to get a good view.</p>

Summary Thoughts Notes Finally, we follow this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion:
You realise that you have to keep reinterpreting memories the older and wiser and more skilled you get, so you eventually learn not to hold on to any current &amp;lsquo;lessons learnt&amp;rsquo; too tightly, but instead to treat them as contingently true things.

<p>Jane Kenyon and I were married for twenty-three years. For two decades we inhabited the double solitude of my family farmhouse in New Hampshire, writing poems, loving the countryside. She was forty-seven when she died. If anyone had asked us, &ldquo;Which year was the best, of your lives together?&rdquo; we could have agreed on an answer: &ldquo;the one we remember least.&rdquo; There were sorrowful years&mdash;the death of her father, my cancers, her depressions&mdash;and there were also years of adventure: a trip to China and Japan, two trips to India; years when my children married; years when the grandchildren were born; years of triumph as Jane began her public life in poetry: her first book, her first poem in the <em>New Yorker</em>. The best moment of our lives was one quiet repeated day of work in our house. Not everyone understood. Visitors, especially from New York, would spend a weekend with us and say as they left: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really pretty here&rdquo; (&ldquo;in Vermont,&rdquo; many added) &ldquo;with your house, the pond, the hills, but . . . but . . . but . . . <em>what do you do</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What we did: we got up early in the morning. I brought Jane coffee in bed. She walked the dog as I started writing, then climbed the stairs to work at her own desk on her own poems. We had lunch. We lay down together. We rose and worked at secondary things. I read aloud to Jane; we played scoreless ping-pong; we read the mail; we worked again. We ate supper, talked, read books sitting across from each other in the living room, and went to sleep. If we were lucky the phone didn&rsquo;t ring all day. In January Jane dreamed of flowers, planning expansion and refinement of the garden. From late March into October she spent hours digging, applying fifty-year-old Holstein manure from under the barn, planting, transplanting, and weeding. Sometimes I went off for two nights to read my poems, essential to the economy, and Jane wrote a poem called &ldquo;Alone for a Week.&rdquo; Later Jane flew away for readings and I loathed being the one left behind. (I filled out coupons from magazines and ordered useless objects.) We traveled south sometimes in cold weather: to Key West in December, a February week in Barbados, to Florida during baseball&rsquo;s spring training, to Bermuda. Rarely we flew to England or Italy for two weeks. Three hundred and thirty days a year we inhabited this old house and the same day&rsquo;s adventurous routine.</p>
<p>What we did: love. We did not spend our days gazing into each other&rsquo;s eyes. We did that gazing when we made love or when one of us was in trouble, but most of the time our gazes met and entwined as they looked at a third thing. Third things are essential to marriages, objects or practices or habits or arts or institutions or games or human beings that provide a site of joint rapture or contentment. Each member of a couple is separate; the two come together in double attention. Lovemaking is not a third thing but two-in-one. John Keats can be a third thing, or the Boston Symphony Orchestra, or Dutch interiors, or Monopoly. For many couples, children are a third thing. Jane and I had no children of our own; we had our cats and dog to fuss and exclaim over&mdash;and later my five grandchildren from an earlier marriage. We had our summer afternoons at the pond, which for ten years made a third thing. After naps we loaded up books and blankets and walked across Route 4 and the old railroad to the steep slippery bank that led down to our private beach on Eagle Pond. Soft moss underfoot sent little red flowers up. Ghost birches leaned over water with wild strawberry plants growing under them. Over our heads white pines reared high, and oaks that warned us of summer&rsquo;s end late in August by dropping green metallic acorns. Sometimes a mink scooted among ferns. After we acquired Gus he joined the pond ecstasy, chewing on stones. Jane dozed in the sun as I sat in the shade reading and occasionally taking a note in a blank book. From time to time we swam and dried in the heat. Then, one summer, leakage from the Danbury landfill turned the pond orange. It stank. The water was not hazardous but it was ruined. A few years later the pond came back but we seldom returned to our afternoons there. Sometimes you lose a third thing.</p>
<p>The South Danbury Christian Church became large in our lives. We were both deacons and Jane was treasurer for a dozen years, utter miscasting and a source of annual anxiety when the treasurer&rsquo;s report was due. I collected the offering; Jane counted and banked it. Once a month she prepared communion and I distributed it. For the Church Fair we both cooked and I helped with the auction. Besides the Church itself, building and community, there was Christianity, the Gospels, and the work of theologians and mystics. Typically we divided our attentions: I read Meister Eckhart while Jane studied Julian of Norwich. I read the Old Testament aloud to her, and the New. If it wasn&rsquo;t the Bible, I was reading aloud late Henry James or Mark Twain or Edith Wharton or Wordworth&rsquo;s <em>Prelude</em>. Reading aloud was a daily connection. When I first pronounced <em>The Ambassadors</em>, Jane had never read it, and I peeked at her flabbergasted face as the boat bearing Chad and Mme. de Vionnet rounded the bend toward Lambert Strether. Three years later, when I had acquired a New York Edition of Henry James, she asked me to read her <em>The Ambassadors</em> again. Late James is the best prose for reading aloud. Saying one of his interminable sentences, the voice must drop pitch every time he interrupts his syntax with periphrasis, and drop again when periphrasis interrupts periphrasis, and again, and then step the pitch up, like climbing stairs in the dark, until the original tone concludes the sentence. One&rsquo;s larynx could write a doctoral dissertation on James&rsquo;s syntax.</p>
<p>Literature in general was a constant. Often at the end of the day Jane would speak about what she had been reading, her latest intense and obsessive absorption in an author: Keats for two years, Chekhov, Elizabeth Bishop. In reading and in everything else, we made clear boundaries, dividing our literary territories. I did not go back to Keats until she had done with him. By and large Jane read intensively while I read extensively. Like a male, I lusted to acquire all the great books of the world and add them to my life list. One day I would realize: I&rsquo;ve never read Darwin! Adam Smith! Gibbon! Gibbon became an obsession with me, then his sources, then all ancient history, then all narrative history. For a few years I concentrated on Henry Adams, even reading six massive volumes of letters.</p>
<p>But there was also ping-pong. When we added a new bedroom, we extended the rootcellar enough to set a ping-pong table into it, and for years we played every afternoon. Jane was assiduous, determined, vicious, and her reach was not so wide as mine. When she couldn&rsquo;t reach a shot I called her &ldquo;Stubbsy,&rdquo; and her next slam would smash me in the groin, rage combined with harmlessness. We rallied half an hour without keeping score. Another trait we shared was hating to lose. Through bouts of ping-pong and Henry James and the church, we kept to one innovation: with rare exceptions, we remained aware of each other&rsquo;s feelings. It took me half my life, more than half, to discover with Jane&rsquo;s guidance that two people could live together and remain kind. When one of us felt grumpy we both shut up until it went away. We did not give in to sarcasm. Once every three years we had a fight&mdash;the way some couples fight three times a day&mdash;and because fights were few the aftermath of a fight was a dreadful gloom. &ldquo;We have done harm,&rdquo; said Jane in a poem after a quarrel. What was <em>that</em> fight about? I wonder if she remembered, a month after writing the poem.</p>
<p>Of course: the third thing that brought us together, and shone at the center of our lives and our house, was poetry&mdash;both our love for the art and the passion and frustration of trying to write it. When we moved to the farm, away from teaching and Jane&rsquo;s family, we threw ourselves into the life of writing poetry as if we jumped from a bridge and swam to survive. I kept the earliest hours of the day for poetry. Jane worked on poems virtually every day; there were dry spells. In the first years of our marriage, I sometimes feared that she would find the project of poetry intimidating, and withdraw or give up or diminish the intensity of her commitment. I remember talking with her one morning early in New Hampshire, maybe in 1976, when the burden felt too heavy. She talked of her singing with the Michigan Chorale, as if music were something she might turn to. She spoke of drawing as another art she could perform, and showed me an old pencil rendering she had made, acorns I think, meticulous and well-made and nothing more. She was saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to give myself to poetry&rdquo;&mdash;and I knew enough not to argue.</p>
<p>However, from year to year she gave more of herself to her art. When she studied Keats, she read all his poems, all his letters, the best three or four biographies; then she read and reread the poems and the letters again. No one will find in her poems clear fingerprints of John Keats, but Jane&rsquo;s ear became more luscious with her love for Keats; her lines became more dense, rifts loaded with ore. Coming from a family for whom ambition was dangerous, in which work was best taken lightly, it was not easy for Jane to wager her life on one number. She lived with someone who had made that choice, but also with someone nineteen years older who wrote all day and published frequently. Her first book of poems came out as I published my fifth. I could have been an inhibitor as easily as I was an encourager&mdash;if she had not been brave and stubborn. I watched in gratified pleasure as her poems became better and better. From being promising she became accomplished and professional; then&mdash;with the later poems of <em>The Boat of Quiet Hours</em>, with &ldquo;Twilight: After Haying,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Briefly It Enters,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Things,&rdquo; she turned into the extraordinary and permanent poet of <em>Otherwise</em>.</p>
<p>People asked us&mdash;people still ask me&mdash;about competition between us. We never spoke of it, but it had to be there&mdash;and it remained benign. When Jane wrote a poem that dazzled me, I wanted to write a poem that would dazzle her. Boundaries helped. We belonged to different generations. Through Jane I got to be friends with poets of her generation, as she did with my friends born in the 1920s. We avoided situations which would subject us to comparison. During the first years of our marriage, when Jane was just beginning to publish, we were asked several times to read our poems together. The people who asked us knew and respected Jane&rsquo;s poems, but the occasions turned ghastly. Once we were introduced by someone we had just met who was happy to welcome Joan Kenyon. Always someone, generally a male English professor, managed to let us know that it was <em>sweet</em>, that Jane wrote poems too. One head of a department asked her if she felt <em>dwarfed</em>. When Jane was condescended to she was furious, and it was only on these occasions that we felt anything unpleasant between us. Jane decided that we would no longer read together.</p>
<p>When places later asked us both to read, we agreed to come but stipulated that we read separately, maybe a day apart. As she published more widely we were more frequently approached. Late in the 1980s, after reading on different days at one university, we did a joint question-and-answer session with writing students. Three quarters of the questions addressed Jane, not me, and afterwards she said, &ldquo;Perkins, I think we can read together now.&rdquo; So, in our last years together, we did many joint readings. When two poets read on the same program, the first reader is the warm-up band, the second the featured act. We read in fifteen-minute segments, ABAB, and switched A and B positions with each reading. In 1993 we read on a Friday in Trivandrum, at the southern tip of India, and three days later in Hanover, New Hampshire. Exhausted as we were, we remembered who had gone first thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>There were days when each of us received word from the same magazine; the same editor had taken a poem by one of us just as he/she rejected the other of us. One of us felt constrained in pleasure. The need for boundaries even extended to style. As Jane&rsquo;s work got better and better&mdash;and readers noticed&mdash;my language and structure departed from its old habits and veered away from the kind of lyric that Jane was writing, toward irony and an apothegmatic style. My diction became more Latinate and polysyllabic, as well as syntactically complex. I was reading Gibbon, learning to use a vocabulary and sentence structure as engines of discrimination. Unconsciously, I was choosing to be as unlike Jane as I could. Still, her poetry influenced and enhanced my own. Her stubborn and unflagging commitment turned its power upon me and exhorted me. My poems got better in this house. When my <em>Old and New Poems</em> came out in 1990, the positive reviews included something like this sentence: &ldquo;Hall began publishing early . . . but it was not until he left his teaching job and returned to the family farm in New Hampshire with his second wife the poet Jane Kenyon that . . .&rdquo; I published <em>Kicking the Leaves</em> in 1978 when Jane published <em>From Room to Room</em>. It was eight years before we published our next books: her <em>The Boat of Quiet Hours</em>, my <em>The Happy Man</em>. (When I told Jane my title her reaction was true Jane: &ldquo;Sounds too depressed.&quot;) I had also been working on drafts of <em>The One Day</em>, maybe my best book. Then Jane wrote <em>Let Evening Come, Constance</em>, and the twenty late poems that begin <em>Otherwise</em>. Two years after her death, a review of Jane began with a sentence I had been expecting. It was uttered in respect, without a sneer, and said that for years we had known of Jane Kenyon as Donald Hall&rsquo;s wife but from now on we will know of Donald Hall as Jane Kenyon&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>We did not show each other early drafts. (It&rsquo;s a bad habit. The comments of another become attached to the words of a poem, steering it or preventing it from following its own way.) But when we had worked over a poem in solitude for a long time, our first reader was the other. I felt anxious about showing Jane new poems, and often invented reasons for delay. Usually, each of us saved up three or four poems before showing them to the other. One day I would say, &ldquo;I left some stuff on your footstool,&rdquo; or Jane would tell me, &ldquo;Perkins, there are some things on your desk.&rdquo; Waiting for a response, each of us already knew some of what the other would say. If ever I repeated a word&mdash;a habit acquired from Yeats&mdash;I knew that Jane would cross it out. Whenever she used verbal auxiliaries she knew I would simplify, and &ldquo;it was raining&rdquo; would become &ldquo;it rained.&rdquo; By and large we ignored the predicted advice, which we had already heard in our heads and dismissed. Jane kept her work clear of dead metaphor, knowing my crankiness on the subject, and she would exult when she found one in my drafts: &ldquo;Perkins! Here&rsquo;s a dead metaphor!&rdquo; These encounters were important but not easy. Sometimes we turned polite with each other: &ldquo;Oh, really! I thought that was the best part . . .&rdquo; (False laugh.) Jane told others&mdash;people questioned us about how we worked together&mdash;that I approached her holding a sheaf of her new poems saying, &ldquo;These are going to be <em>good</em>!&rdquo; to which she would say, &ldquo;Going to be, eh?&rdquo; She told people that she would climb back to her study, carrying the poems covered with my illegible comments, thinking, &ldquo;Perkins just doesn&rsquo;t get it. And then,&rdquo; she would continue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do everything he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of us did everything the other said. Reading <em>Otherwise</em> I find words I wanted her to change, and sometimes I still think I was right. But we helped each other greatly. She saved me a thousand gaffes, cut my wordiness and straightened out my syntax. She seldom told me that anything was <em>good</em>. &ldquo;This is almost done,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got to do this in two lines not three.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought this a long way, Perkins&rdquo;&mdash;without telling me if I had brought it to a good place. Sometimes her praise expressed its own limits. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken this as far as the intellect can take it.&rdquo; When she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s finished. Don&rsquo;t change a word,&rdquo; I would ask, &ldquo;But is it any <em>good</em> ? Do you <em>like</em> it?&rdquo; I pined for her praise, and seldom got it. I remember one evening in 1992 when we sat in the living room and she read through the manuscript of <em>The Museum of Clear Ideas</em>. Earlier she had seen only a few poems at a time, and she had not been enthusiastic. I watched her dark face as she turned the pages. Finally she looked over at me and tears started from her eyes. &ldquo;Perkins, I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> it!&rdquo; Tears came to my eyes too, and I said, rapidly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; (That book was anti-Jane in its manner, or most of it was, dependant on syntax and irony, a little like Augustan poetry, more than on images.) When we looked over each other&rsquo;s work, it was essential that we never lie to each other. Even when Jane was depressed, I never praised a poem unless I meant it; I never withheld blame. If either of us had felt that the other was pulling punches, it would have ruined what was so essential to our house.</p>
<p>We were each other&rsquo;s readers but we could not be each other&rsquo;s only readers. I mostly consulted friends and editors by mail, so many helpers that I will not try to list them, poets from my generation and poets Jane&rsquo;s age and even younger. Jane worked regularly, the last dozen years of her life, with the poet Joyce Peseroff and the novelist Alice Mattison. The three of them worked wonderfully together, each supplying things that the other lacked. They fought, they laughed, they rewrote and cut and rearranged. Jane would return from a workshop exhausted yet unable to keep away from her desk, working with wild excitement to follow suggestions. The three women were not only being literary critics for each other. Each had grown up knowing that it was not permitted for females to be as aggressive as males, and all were ambitious in their art, and encouraged each other in their ambition. I felt close to Alice and Joyce, my friends as well as Jane&rsquo;s, but I did not stick my nose into their deliberations. If I had tried to, I would have lost a nose. Even when they met at our house, I was careful to stay apart. They met often at Joyce&rsquo;s in Massachusetts, because it was half way between Jane and Alice. They met in New Haven at Alice&rsquo;s. When I was recovering from an operation, and Jane and I didn&rsquo;t want to be separated, there were workshops at the Lord Jeffrey Inn in Amherst. We four ate together and made pilgrimages to Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s house and grave, but while they worked together I wrote alone in an adjacent room. This three-part friendship was essential to Jane&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>Meantime we lived in the house of poetry, which was also the house of love and grief; the house of solitude and art; the house of Jane&rsquo;s depression and my cancers and Jane&rsquo;s leukemia. When someone died whom we loved, we went back to the poets of grief and outrage, as far back as <em>Gilgamesh</em>; often I read aloud Henry King&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Exequy,&rdquo; written in the seventeenth century after the death of his young wife. Poetry gives the griever not release from grief but companionship in grief. Poetry embodies the complexities of feeling at their most intense and entangled, and therefore offers (over centuries, or over no time at all) the company of tears. As I sat beside Jane in her pain and weakness I wrote about pain and weakness. Once in a hospital I noticed that the leaves were turning. I realized that I had not noticed that they had come to the trees. It was a year without seasons, a year without punctuation. I began to write &ldquo;Without&rdquo; to embody the sensations of lives under dreary, monotonous assault. After I had drafted it many times I read it aloud to Jane. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Perkins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Even in this poem written at her mortal bedside there was companionship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive task analysis (CTA) is a set of methods for identifying cognitive skills, or mental demands, needed to perform a task proficiently. The product of the task analysis can be used to inform the design of interfaces and training systems. However, CTA is resource intensive and has previously been of limited use to design practitioners. A streamlined method of CTA, Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA), is presented in this paper. ACTA consists of three interview methods that help the practitioner to extract information about the cognitive demands and skills required for a task. ACTA also allows the practitioner to represent this information in a format that will translate more directly into applied products, such as improved training scenarios or interface recommendations. This paper will describe the three methods, an evaluation study conducted to assess the usability and usefulness of the methods, and some directions for future research for making cognitive task analysis accessible to practitioners. ACTA techniques were found to be easy to use, flexible, and to provide clear output. The information and training materials developed based on ACTA interviews were found to be accurate and important for training purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As task analytic techniques have become more sophisticated, focusing on cognitive activities as well as behaviours, they have become less accessible to practitioners. This paper introduces Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA), a set of streamlined cognitive task an alysis tools that have been developed specifically for use by professionals who have not been trained in cognitive psychology, but who do develop ap plications that can benefit from the use of cognitive task analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="applied-cognitive-task-analysis">Applied cognitive task analysis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate techniques that would enable instructional designers and systems designers to elicit critical cognitive elements from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The techniques presented here are intended to be complementary; each is designed to get at different aspects of cognitive skill.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first technique, the task diagram interview, provides the interviewer with a broad overview of the task and highlights the difficult cognitive portions of the task to be probed further with in-depth interviews.</li>
<li>The second technique, the knowledge audit, surveys the aspects of expertise required for a specific task or subtask. As each aspect of expertise is uncovered, it is probed for concrete examples in the context of the job, cues and strategies used, and why it presents a challenge to inexperienced people.</li>
<li>The third technique, the simulation interview, allows the interviewer to probe the cognitive processes of the SMEs within the context of a specific scenario. The use of a simulation or scenario provides job context that is difficult to obtain via the other interview techniques, and therefore allows additional probing around issues such as situation assessment, how situation assessment impacts a course of action, and potential errors that a novice would be likely to make given the same situation.</li>
<li>Finally, a cognitive demands table is offered as a means to consolidate and synthesize the data, so that it can be directly applied to a specific project.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="task-diagram">Task diagram</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The task diagram elicits a broad overview of the task and identifies the difficult cognitive elements. Although this preliminary interview offers only a surface-level view of the cognitive elements of the task, it enables the interviewer to focus the more in-depth interviews (i.e. the knowledge audit and simulation interviews) so that time and resources can be spent unpacking the most difficult and relevant of those cognitive elements.</p>
<p>The subject matter expert is asked to decompose the task into steps or subtasks with a question such as, `Think about what you do when you (task of interest). Can you break this task down into less than six, but more than three steps?' The goal is to get the expert to walk through the task in his / her mind, verbalizing major steps. The interviewer limits the SME to between three and six steps, to ensure that time is not wasted delving into minute detail during the surface-level interview. After the steps of the task have been articulated, the SME is asked to identify which of the steps require cognitive skill, with a question such as, `Of the steps you have just identified which require difficult cognitive skills? By cognitive skills I mean judgements, assessments, problem solving ± thinking skills'. The resulting diagram (figure 1) serves as a road map for future interviews, providing an overview of the major steps involved in the task and the sequence in which the steps are carried out, as well as which of the steps require the most cognitive skill.</p>
<p>The task diagram interview is intended to provide a surface-level look at the task, and does not attempt to unpack the mental model of each SME. The goal is to elicit a very broad overview of the task.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-audit">Knowledge audit</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The knowledge audit identifies ways in which expertise is used in a domain and provides examples based on actual experience. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>The knowledge audit employs a set of probes designed to describe types of domain knowledge or skill and elicit appropriate examples (figure 2). The goal is not simply to find out whether each component is present in the task, but to find out the nature of these skills, specific events where they were required, strategies that have been used, and so forth. The list of probes is the starting point for conducting this interview. Then, the interviewer asks for specifics about the example in terms of critical cues and strategies of decision making. This is followed by a discussion of potential errors that a novice, less-experienced person might have made in this situation.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Basic probes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Past &amp; Future</strong></p>
<p>Experts can figure out how a situation developed, and they can think into the future to see where the situation is going. Amongst other things, this can allow experts to head off problems before they develop.</p>
<p><em>Is there a time when you walked into the middle of a situation and knew exactly how things got there and where they were headed?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<p>Novices may only see bits and pieces. Experts are able to quickly build an understanding of the whole situation &mdash; the Big Picture view. This allows the expert to think about how different elements fit together and affect each other.</p>
<p><em>Can you give me an example of what is important about the Big Picture for this task? What are the major elements you have to know and keep track of?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Noticing</strong></p>
<p>Experts are able to detect cues and see meaningful patterns that less-experienced personnel may miss altogether.</p>
<p><em>Have you had experiences where part of a situation just &lsquo;popped&rsquo; out at you; where you noticed things going on that others didn&rsquo;t catch? What is an example?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job Smarts</strong></p>
<p>Experts learn how to combine procedures and work the task in the most efficient way possible. They don&rsquo;t cut corners, but they don&rsquo;t waste time and resources either.</p>
<p><em>When you do this task, are there ways of working smart or accomplishing more with less &mdash; that you have found especially useful?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opportunities/Improvising</strong></p>
<p>Experts are comfortable improvising &mdash; seeing what will work in this particular situation; they are able to shift directions to take advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Can you think of an example when you have improvised in this task or noticed an opportunity to do something better?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Experts are aware of their performance; they check how they are doing and make adjustments. Experts notice when their performance is not what it should be (this could be due to stress, fatigue, high workload, etc) and are able to adjust so that the job gets done.</p>
<p><em>Can you think of a time when you realised that you would need to change the way you were performing in order to get the job done?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional Probes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anomalies</strong></p>
<p>Novices don&rsquo;t know what is typical, so they have a hard time identifying what is atypical. Experts can quickly spot unusual events and detect deviations. And, they are able to notice when something that ought to happen, doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><em>Can you describe an instance when you spotted a deviation from the norm, or knew something was amiss?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equipment Difficulties</strong></p>
<p>Equipment can sometimes mislead. Novices usually believe whatever the equipment tells them; they don&rsquo;t know when to be skeptical.</p>
<p><em>Have there been times when the equipment pointed in one direction, but your own judgment told you to do something else? Or when you had to rely on experience to avoid being led astray by the equipment?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="simulation-interview">Simulation interview</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The simulation interview allows the interviewer to better understand the SME&rsquo;s cognitive processes within the context of an incident. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>The simulation interview is based on presentation of a challenging scenario to the SME. The authors recommend that the interviewer retrieves a scenario that already exists for use in this interview. Often, simulations and scenarios exist for training purposes. It may be necessary to adapt or modify the scenario to conform to practical constraints such as time limitations. Developing a new simulation specifically for use in the interview is not a trivial task and is likely to require an upfront CTA in order to gather the foundational information needed to present a challenging situation. The simulation can be in the form of a paper-and-pencil exercise, perhaps using maps or other diagrams. In some settings it may be possible to use video or computer-supported simulations. Surprisingly, in the authors' experience, the fidelity of the simulation is not an important issue. The key is that the simulation presents a challenging scenario.</p>
<p>After exposure to the simulation, the SME is asked to identify major events, including judgements and decisions, with a question such as, `As you experience this simulation, imagine you are the (job you are investigating) in the incident. Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation'. Each event is probed for situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event (figure 3).</p>
<p>Information elicited is recorded in the simulation interview table (table 2). Using the same simulation for interviews with multiple SMEs can provide insight into situations in which more than one action would be acceptable, and alternative assessments of the same situation are plausible. This technique can be used to highlight differing SME perspectives, which is important information for developing training and system design recommendations. The technique can also be used to contrast expert and novice perspectives by conducting interviews with people of differing levels of expertise using the same simulation.</p>

<h4 id="cognitive-demands-table">Cognitive demands table</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>After conducting ACTA interviews with multiple SMEs, the authors recommend the use of a cognitive demands table (table 3) to sort through and analyse the data. Clearly, not every bit of information discussed in an interview will be relevant for the goals of a specific project. The cognitive demands table is intended to provide a format for the practitioner to use in focusing the analysis on project goals. The authors offer sample headings for the table based on analyses that they have conducted in the past (difficult cognitive element, why difficult, comm on errors, and cues and strategies used), but recommend that practitioners focus on the types of information that they will need to develop a new course or design a new system. The table also helps the practitioner see common themes in the data, as well as conflicting information given by multiple SMEs.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s nearly always more fruitful to mine the literature for <em>already</em>-extracted mental models of expertise. A few weeks ago, I learnt of Lia DiBello, an NDM researcher who specialises in the extraction of <em>tacit mental models of business expertise.</em></p>
<p>DiBello&rsquo;s findings are extremely compelling. She writes, in <em><a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198795872.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198795872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oxford Handbook of Expertise</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198795872.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198795872" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)</em>:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>After several years using different methods, we noticed that highly talented business performers are very similar to each other. That is, they have decoded the domain of business much like chess masters had decoded chess. This led us to realise that &mdash;as a domain&mdash;<strong>business itself is an orderly closed system of relations between principles, and that so-called intuitive experts in business have an implicit grasp of this</strong>. If this is the case, it would follow that all highly skilled business experts should recognise each other and share a common mental model of these principles, although they may manifest differently in different industries. <strong>Since business has been evolving in recent years, this model would have to be very robust, running deeper than recent societal changes.</strong> <em>(emphasis mine)</em></p>
</div>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>I dove into DiBello&rsquo;s publication history [<a href="/posts/165037bc-129d-4cab-97ab-c257733539af/">Deep-dive reading</a>]. This turned out to be relatively easy &mdash; I quickly learnt that DiBello has published a relatively small number of papers, especially when compared against the research output of some expertise researchers. Initially, I found this frustrating, but then I realised that she has spent the bulk of the past 20 years consulting for big companies, <em>applying her research to the real world</em>. (During her <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/naturalistic/episode-28-interview-with-ydLRG3pAaB0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview on the NDM podcast</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/naturalistic/episode-28-interview-with-ydLRG3pAaB0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), she says (54:04) somewhat ruefully, &ldquo;Because of how I wanted to get a lot of data, I ended up selling my soul to big business, and I made a lot of rich people richer. But it was how I got to prove that what we do works.&quot;). She spends more time today attempting to adapt her training methods for broader uses, to make them available to businesspeople who might not be able to afford a full consultation. To my mind, this makes her more, not less, <a href="https://commoncog.com/believability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believable</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/believability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dibello-s-main-ideas">DiBello&rsquo;s main ideas</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The bulk of her work follows from these three big ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Business expertise consists of a handful of properties: (a) it is team-based &mdash; meaning that business expertise is actually a form of <em>distributed cognition</em>, with expertise spread amongst an executive team; (b) it consists of two things: domain-specific mental models of the business <em>and</em> cognitive agility; and (c) there is a deeper mental model that underpins those domain-specific mental models, which explains how good business people are able to recognise other good business people, even if they are from different industries.</li>
<li>She argues that general problem solving ability does not matter so much in business so much as a property she describes as <em>cognitive agility</em> &mdash; which is the ability to update mental models in light of new information.</li>
<li>Her primary innovation is an intervention known as the FutureView Profiler. The Profiler is able to evaluate the shared mental models of an executive team: it is able to (a) identify blind spots in the executive team&rsquo;s model of the business, (b) able to evaluate cognitive agility, and (c) able to measure expertise in business primarily because it asks business people to do <em>year-by-year predictions of similar companies within their own industries</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve highlighted the most immediately useful elements of her work above, but I want to note that the ideas sit on top of a few other contributions that are novel from an expertise research perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>DiBello&rsquo;s insight that domain-specific <strong>prediction tasks</strong> are a useful way to evaluate business skill is a huge contribution to the literature on expertise. She spends a few paragraphs in her 2010 paper [2] discussing why the Profiler works, and why other assessments of business skill do not. (The gist of the argument is that you want to evaluate how a business person&rsquo;s mental models update in response to a <em>dynamic context</em>; you do not want to evaluate what currently exists in their heads).</li>
<li>Her company, Workplace Technology Research Inc (WTRI), has spent years implementing company training simulations in virtual worlds. Apart from the obvious technical effort (she explains [3] that they decided to code a full world of their own, on a game engine of their choice, mostly because existing companies they collaborated with kept getting acquired or shut down) &mdash; she has novel insights on the pedagogical effectiveness of using virtual game worlds to teach business simulations.</li>
<li>Last, but perhaps most importantly, DiBello argues that business expertise is primarily a matter of <em>organisation</em>. She writes, in the <em>Oxford Handbook</em>: &ldquo;Like experts in other domains, business experts rely not on greater analysis or greater information, but <em>better ways of structuring or organising their knowledge</em>. Further, a business expert differs in the <em>manner in which he or she looks at the business landscape, particularly with regard to what is linked with what and what is important to manipulate</em>.&rdquo; As a result, the bulk of DiBello&rsquo;s training methods aim to do what is called &lsquo;cognitive reorganisation&rsquo; &mdash; that is, WTRI does not seek to teach business people new concepts about their domain per se, but to instead reorganise existing domain-specific mental models in their heads.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-mental-model-of-business">The mental model of business</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Oxford Handbook</em>, DiBello writes:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>In a study funded by the National Science Foundation conducted over four years (NSF Award ENG 9548631) we found that those who show considerable and consistent talent in business have such a mental model, shown in predictable ways of making use of information. Leveraging our relationships with companies and clients, we had unusual personal access to study a large number of highly placed leaders. Doing in-depth studies of talented business leaders who were repeat successes&mdash;even in very challenging markets&mdash;and who had risen to very high positions (such as chairmen of large corporations) and maintained that level of position even as business itself has grown much more complex, we discovered a shared mental model among all of them. [1]</p>
</div>
<p>That shared mental model is essentially a triad:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Our research revealed that people who have achieved a high level of business expertise have a deep understanding of the following three core areas: <strong>(1) factors involved in effective operations, (2) forces influencing the market, and (3) those driving business finance and economic climates.</strong> Consistently successful business leaders have been shown to <strong>intuitively understand these areas and their impact on each other, and to pay attention to this fundamental triad in a uniquely dynamic way within a guiding context of business strategy.</strong> For example, these experts are able to sense that market conditions change based on environmental indications that others may fail to notice. Further, they foresee the consequences to their business operations and finances, and thus make necessary adjustments proactively. Unlike most business professionals, they are attuned to the early indicators of widespread change. Beyond this, they are <strong>expert at keeping the triad in balance, or shifting the balance when external conditions are conducive to do so</strong> (e.g., focusing on marketing during favourable economic times). <em>(emphasis added)</em> [2]</p>
</div>
<p>Throughout the paper, DiBello describes the triad using different names. One way of describing it is &lsquo;supply/demand/capital&rsquo;. Another is &lsquo;leadership/strategy/finance&rsquo;. To summarise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supply, or leadership</strong> &mdash; These represent operational concerns related to the business, what DiBello calls &lsquo;factors involved in effective operations&rsquo;. Naturally, how the operational concerns are expressed depends on the industry (e.g. you have to be good at <a href="https://commoncog.com/product-validation-taste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product development</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/product-validation-taste/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) if you&rsquo;re in consumer software, and you must have competent <a href="https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1416833586372698116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manufacturing if you&rsquo;re Chobani</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1416833586372698116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)). Think expansively when it comes to each category of the triad &mdash; this category includes things like org design, incentive structures, execution cadence, and even the ability to get things done within the company (e.g. execs must have good mental models of the org and its people, and the ability to push through plans given internal politics).</li>
<li><strong>Demand, or strategy</strong> &mdash; These represent the exec&rsquo;s understanding of the market, what DiBello calls &lsquo;forces influencing the market&rsquo;. Of course, market dynamics is a very broad category, and includes everything from market shape, competitive analysis, positioning, changing consumer demand, and the &lsquo;path to power&rsquo; that we&rsquo;ve talked about in our <a href="https://commoncog.com/7-powers-in-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/7-powers-in-practice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) of <em><a href="https://commoncog.com/7-powers-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 Powers</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/7-powers-summary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Capital, or finance</strong> &mdash; At the basic level this represents the exec&rsquo;s understanding of basic financial concepts like <a href="https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash flow lockup</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), return on invested capital, margins, and their relationship with the other two categories (what DiBello calls &lsquo;factors driving business finance and economic climates&rsquo;). The factors here may be equally expansive &mdash; depending on the business, the capital leg of the triad may include expertise with raising capital (e.g. equity financing, debt) or the ability to understand the implications of changes in the capital environment (e.g. John Malone was amongst the first in the cable industry to take advantage of junk bonds in order to <a href="https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/#john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finance expansion</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/cash-flow-games/#john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>); a more contemporary example might be startup founders who understand how to manipulate extremely liquid private markets to their advantage).</li>
</ol>
<p>As DiBello mentions, the key property of business expertise is in understanding how a change in one leg of the triad affects the other two legs, at least within the context of one&rsquo;s specific industry. Experts are able to notice cues in the environment long before novices are able to, and are then able to forward-simulate what must be done to the other two legs of the triad. So, for example, if there is a change in the capital environment, an expert businessperson might ask how that affects competition (this is the market &mdash; the demand leg of the triad). And they might immediately ask what changes the company must make in response to those market shifts? (This is the supply leg of the triad).</p>
<p>This mental model of business is incredibly high-level, but <em>it tells us a lot.</em></p>
<p>For instance, it tells us that expertise may be evaluated according to the facility an exec has with each of the three categories. DiBello writes:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>In contrast, <strong>competent managers (one level down from experts) tend to be very talented in only one or two of these areas; however, they often do not understand the dynamics between these areas as well as the &ldquo;superstars&rdquo; do</strong>. Competent managers are likely to be very successful when larger market or economic trends are favourable to their specific skills. <em>(emphasis added)</em> [2]</p>
</div>
<p>The implication is that if you want to get really good at business, you should systematically acquire skills in each of the three categories, specific to your particular business, and then &mdash; more importantly &mdash; <em>grok the relationships between the three categories</em>.</p>
<p>It also explains another observation that DiBello makes:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Experts in the same domain easily identify each other. Even if they don&rsquo;t agree with another expert&rsquo;s choices, they easily recognise that they share a common perceptual experience within their area of expertise. [2]</p>
</div>
<p>With the triad model, we may begin to understand how an experienced businessperson is able to recognise another experienced businessperson from a different industry, despite having no idea of the specifics of the other expert&rsquo;s business or market. The answer to this puzzle is that they are able to recognise the intuitive facility with which the other person reasons about supply, demand, and capital in their own businesses! When I read DiBello&rsquo;s articulation of the model, I thought back to certain businesspeople who have told me that they can tell if someone &lsquo;gets it&rsquo;, even if they can&rsquo;t articulate how; what I now think is happening is that their brains must be attuned to the existence of a triad in the other person&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Do I buy this model of business expertise? Yes, I do. <em>Nearly everything I know about business lines up with the model</em>. To my mind, this explains a handful of unrelated phenomena that I&rsquo;ve long puzzled over. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are fresh MBA grads unable to grok the implications of, say, cash flow in a given business, despite learning it in their courses? The answer is obvious: they have yet to internalise the <em>relationships</em> between a) market conditions and b) operational realities with c) the financial concepts they learnt in school. Every business is a system, and developing intuition for a system requires you to watch that system in action. Business students who have no real world experience of a business do not usually have such a mental model. DiBello writes, as part of a consulting engagement: <em>&lsquo;As a process check, we administered the same instrument to an equal of number of business-knowledgeable controls (BS or MBA business students who were not yet functioning managers or consultants and had not ever actually run a company of any size). Their performance was much lower. This, too, was an expected result.'</em> [2]</li>
<li>How many different ways are there to build <a href="https://commoncog.com/7-powers-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/7-powers-summary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) in business? I used to think that companies with better products would win, and then I believed that companies with better distribution would win, and then I ran a business for awhile and realised that businesses have won from differentiated product or differentiated distribution or differentiated access to capital; the possibilities were more varied than I had originally imagined. With the triad, it&rsquo;s clearer to me that temporary competitive advantage may emerge from <em>any</em> of the three categories: you could gain a temporary edge from operational excellence (supply/leadership), or from exploiting some market opportunity (through product innovation or repositioning into a new category &mdash; this is demand/strategy), or even from exploiting some change in the capital environment that others in your industry do not realise exists (e.g. Malone with debt-funded, tax-sheltered expansion &mdash; this is capital/finance).</li>
<li>Buffett&rsquo;s quote &ldquo;I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor&rdquo; makes more sense when seen through the lens of the triad &mdash; it&rsquo;s likely that exposure to equity investing or actual business operations would shore up one or more of the three categories. As a trivial example, a businessperson without a competent understanding of capital markets is missing one leg of the triad; an investor without a sufficiently realistic understanding of business operations (supply) is missing another.</li>
<li><em>Everything</em> in <a href="https://commoncog.com/an-mba-for-business-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An MBA for Business Operators</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/an-mba-for-business-operators/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) may be organised neatly into one of these three categories. In fact, if you look at Permanent Equity&rsquo;s checklist through the lens of the triad, you&rsquo;d realise that it is a mix of supply and capital considerations &hellip; but leaves out demand. This makes sense &mdash; to a private equity fund like Permanent Equity, the demand/strategy side of things is the bit that is most specific to the individual business, and cannot be generalised.</li>
<li>Can management consultants or former VCs become good business operators? With the triad in mind, we can be more specific about what must happen: management consultants are likely better equipped in the demand leg of the triad, with some understanding of the finance leg; VCs are better equipped in the finance leg, and somewhat skilled in the demand leg. How well they do is how quickly they level up on the supply leg of the triad, and how well they internalise the relationships between all three.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reiterate the most important point again: DiBello&rsquo;s explication of the triad mental model tells us that it is the <em>relationships</em> between the three that we need to pay attention to; expertise in each leg of the triad is more commonplace when we rise through the stages of business ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="create-node-for-this-triad">Create node for this triad</h4>
<h3 id="cognitive-agility">Cognitive agility</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>DiBello also points out business expertise is made up of one other quality &mdash; something she calls <em>cognitive agility</em>:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Given the volatility of markets and the complexity of team decision making in large organisations, we need not be as concerned with the general cognitive ability of today&rsquo;s executive so much as his or her domain-specific expertise and cognitive agility, which is often associated with the kind of intuitive expertise developed through experience. <strong>Cognitive agility is what allows executives to rapidly respond to changing situations and revise guiding mental models to meet performance demands</strong>. <em>(emphasis added)</em> In sum, these insights require us to shift away from thinking of the cognitive ability of business leaders as fixed and static, and instead to focus on the way in which expertise evolves over time in response to dynamic environments. It also requires us to discard attempts to locate decision-making expertise as a fixed capacity that resides within the individual decision maker. [2]</p>
</div>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Building on theories of emergence, adaptation, and flexibility from complexity science and NDM, we use the term cognitive agility to refer to the extent to which an individual revises his or her evaluation of a situation in response to data indicating that conditions have changed. <strong>The converse is cognitive rigidity, where the person is impervious to new data, being dominated by a rigid framework or paradigm that acts to filter out new, possibly relevant, information, creating blind spots</strong>. [2]</p>
</div>
<p>When I read this section of DiBello&rsquo;s 2010 paper, my eyes basically popped out of my head.</p>
<p>For several years now, I&rsquo;ve tried to talk about the limits of frameworks, as experienced from the perspective of a business operator. I&rsquo;ve noticed that when a market changes, or when you&rsquo;re operating in a local environment, no framework can fully capture everything that you&rsquo;re seeing as you brush against reality. I&rsquo;ve attempted to capture this idea by writing blog posts such as <a href="https://commoncog.com/reality-without-frameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Without Frameworks</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/reality-without-frameworks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), and <a href="https://commoncog.com/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How First Principle Thinking Fails</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) and <a href="https://commoncog.com/good-synthesis-adapting-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Synthesis is the Start of Good Sensemaking</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/good-synthesis-adapting-to-uncertainty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>). More importantly, I&rsquo;ve attempted to articulate DiBello&rsquo;s notion of <em>cognitive rigidity</em>, with a trait I invented that I named &lsquo;<a href="https://commoncog.com/dismissively-stubborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dismissively Stubborn</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/dismissively-stubborn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)&rsquo;. I wrote that piece to explain the type of people I&rsquo;ve learnt to avoid in startup environments.</p>
<p>But it turns out that <em>DiBello had thought of this, and more, a full decade before I did</em>. I was also surprised &mdash; and delighted! &mdash; to learn that senior business leaders have thought about this particular aspect of business expertise:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>(We present) a case in which we used the Profiler to assess the senior management team of a medical device company. Our relationship with the company began when the chairman and acting CEO asked us to evaluate his senior staff for succession planning purposes. In particular, he wished to decide who, among the division presidents, would succeed him as the CEO. At the time, the company was growing very rapidly. During the four months we worked with the company between 2005 and 2006, we saw them grow from $300 million to $400 million. A pending acquisition was intended to increase the company&rsquo;s size to $600 million by 2008.</p>
<p>The CEO of the company was aware that <strong>there is a qualitative difference between competent managers, who do very well in interviews or on personality tests, and experts, who can perform under challenging conditions</strong>. He wanted to protect himself from (mere) competence at a time when his industry was in a high growth phase. <strong>He was afraid that a favourable market might be masking a lack of skill&mdash;and cognitive agility in particular&mdash;among his senior staff.</strong> <em>(emphasis added).</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-futureview-profiler">The FutureView Profiler</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In their 2010 paper, DiBello, Lehmann and Missildine laid out the requirements of a good instrument to assess business expertise:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>We believe that an instrument that effectively assesses business expertise must (1) be able to draw on the intuitive expertise of organisational members; (2) tap into the specific mental models individuals use to approach problems, rather than basic problem solving or generalised decision making skills; (3) locate individuals within the distributed cognition of an organisation, that is, specify the individual&rsquo;s role in the organisation; (4) be able to identify strengths and blind spots of the organisation&rsquo;s transactive memory system and, in so doing, highlight dimensions of expertise that contribute to high-level decision making; and lastly, (5) measure not only cognitive ability, but also cognitive agility, that is, the capacity to rapidly revise one&rsquo;s mental model in the face of dynamic feedback.</p>
<p>The Profiler requires the user (1) to examine and analyse the same material used by actual experts (e.g., annual reports, 10K&rsquo;s, analyst&rsquo;s reports, etc., from actual companies) to make business decisions, (2) to make predictions about the company with respect to a number of domains (e.g., revenues), and (3) to judge various aspects of the company (e.g., evaluate the management team).</p>
<p>Specifically, the Profiler asks users to answer several questions about the company to predict how its finances will develop over the next five years. Users&rsquo; answers are evaluated in terms of Dreyfus&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-stage model of expertise</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) to determine their business acumen and level of expertise within the domain of business strategy. The Profiler also helps us identify blind spots in users' thinking; that is, we can discern areas where users seem to miss aspects critical to the company&rsquo;s performance. Moreover, for each prediction or judgment users must indicate the specific materials they relied on, such as discrepancies in annual report statements or the general state of the company&rsquo;s finances. This aspect of the Profiler taps into the heuristics that are guiding users' decision making. [2]</p>

<p>How are users evaluated? DiBello et al note that the triad (the extracted mental model of business) isn&rsquo;t directly addressed in the Profiler itself &mdash; even though it informs the design of the assessment:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>These three core areas are not directly addressed in the questions we ask in the Profiler. Rather, an individual&rsquo;s answers are rated and compared to those of the ideal expert. The questions are based on tangible outcomes and concern the company&rsquo;s performance. The questions ask users to evaluate their company with respect to its strategy, leadership, and finances. These are areas that senior executives would be expected to make valid predictions about and are good ways to reveal their underlying business expertise. For example, a question about finances would be: As the senior manager for the business, which aspect of financial performance most urgently requires your attention? This question would then be followed by a series of options, such as &ldquo;cost of goods sold,&rdquo; &ldquo;fixed assets,&rdquo; &ldquo;receivables,&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&amp;D.&rdquo; To answer this question&mdash;that is, to know what is troubling or of concern in the total context of the company at that time&mdash;the user must understand operations, finance, and market trends. Answer options reflect levels of expertise, 1 through 5, corresponding to the five stages in the Dreyfus model. The &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer is empirically determined. Because these are actual cases, the outcomes are known and the root causes of problems have been identified.</p>
<p>In addition to these Dreyfus questions tapping their business expertise, users are asked to provide three predictions that refer to quantitative outcomes in the company&rsquo;s performance. These questions can vary slightly, as the instrument is customised according to a company&rsquo;s needs; however, they will ask about issues, such as profits and revenues, that are indicative of how well a user can synthesise information about the company to predict real-world outcomes. For example, we may ask: What is your prediction of the company&rsquo;s profits for the next 12 months? Users then indicate their answers along a 5-point Likert scale whose points are labelled appropriately, for instance, in the preceding example, options may range from &ldquo;down 20% or greater&rdquo; to &ldquo;up 20% or greater.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>After this initial set of questions, DiBello steps forward the simulation and presents the results of their first year of predictions. This is the primary way that they are able to assess cognitive agility:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Users then go on to Year 2. After reading through the Year 2 materials, they are able to see whether or not their predictions were validated by the company&rsquo;s performance. In other words, they receive feedback as to the accuracy of the previous year&rsquo;s predictions. They repeat this exercise for five years of material, making predictions and getting feedback as to whether or not their predictions have been validated. <strong>This iterative process taps into users' cognitive agility, allowing us to assess the degree to which users are able to revise their thinking in the face of feedback about company performance and their own predictions. Cognitively agile individuals learn from their inaccurate predictions or judgments and improve as they go along</strong>. <em>(emphasis added)</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, we can see persistent blind spots that may exist and occur consistently across all five years. Thus, the Profiler can provide windows into the acumen, blind spots, mental models, and agility with which users approach complex decision making for a real company. It is important to keep in mind that all of the data provided are from real companies. We do not determine the outcomes, as they are taken from actual annual reports and actual finances over a given period of time.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating users' direct responses to the Dreyfus and Likert questions, we also ask users to point to sections of the material they reviewed (including statements in the annual reports and financial summaries) that informed their decision on a particular question. For example, the annual report might mention a recent acquisition. This may reflect a strategic turning point for the company. As such, after users respond to the question on strategy, they must indicate what sections of the material influenced their decision. Users are allowed to choose up to five reasons for their decision. In this case, users should be aware that the recent acquisition plays a major role in the company&rsquo;s strategy going forward, even if this is not immediately obvious. As such, when users answer this particular strategy question, they should be pointing to the acquisition as a basis for their decision. This not only allows us to evaluate the expertise and accuracy of their responses, but also gives us a window into the kinds of information they use to approach the decision-making process. Furthermore, this aspect of the Profiler allows us to determine whether users are utilising information based on the three core areas listed above: supply, demand, and finance. Specifically, we can see whether users approach the questions in an expert manner by evaluating the degree to which they are paying attention to these core areas as they make decisions.</p>
</div>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>I believe DiBello when she says that the Profiler is able to detect blindspots in an exec team, that it is able to evaluate cognitive agility, and that you may use it to assess the expertise of business decision makers. I&rsquo;m just not sure how this may be used, if one isn&rsquo;t able to afford DiBello&rsquo;s services.</p>

The criteria in the studies that Meehl (1954) discussed were diverse, with outcome measures ranging from academic success to patient recidivism and propensity for violence. Although the algorithms were based on a subset of the information available to the clinicians, statistical predictions were more accurate than human predictions in almost every case. Meehl (1954) believed that the inferiority of clinical judgment was due in part to systematic errors, such as the consistent neglect of the base rates of outcomes in discussion of individual cases. In a wellknown article, he later explained his reluctance to attend clinical conferences by citing his annoyance with the clinicians' uncritical reliance on their intuition and their failure to apply elementary statistical reasoning (Meehl, 1973).</p>

<p>Once upon a time (true story), I was on my way to a hotel in a new city. I knew the hotel was many miles down this long, branchless road. So I drove for a long while.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-07-27_08-21-27_t3_n6a_2.png.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>After a while, I began to worry I had passed the hotel.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-07-27_08-21-36_t3_n6a_3.png.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>So, instead of proceeding at 60 miles per hour the way I had been, I continued in the same direction for several more minutes at 30 miles per hour, wondering if I should keep going or turn around.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-07-27_08-21-41_t3_n6a_4.png.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>After a while, I realized: I was being silly! If the hotel was ahead of me, I&rsquo;d get there fastest if I kept going 60mph. And if the hotel was behind me, I&rsquo;d get there fastest by heading at 60 miles per hour in the other direction. And if I <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> going to turn around yet &ndash; if my best bet given the uncertainty was to check <em>N</em> more miles of highway first, <em>before</em> I turned around &ndash; then, again, I&rsquo;d get there fastest by choosing a value of <em>N</em>, speeding along at 60 miles per hour until my odometer said I&rsquo;d gone <em>N</em> miles, and <em>then</em> turning around and heading at 60 miles per hour in the opposite direction [<a href="/posts/f1882164-0604-4dd9-ae59-df0d7b9d5ca2/#feedback-loop">Feedback loop</a>].</p>
<p>Either way, fullspeed was best. My mind had been naively averaging two courses of action &ndash; the thought was something like: &ldquo;maybe I should go forward, and maybe I should go backward. So, since I&rsquo;m uncertain, I should go forward at half-speed!&rdquo; But averages don&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> work that way.</p>
<p>Following this, I started noticing lots of hotels in my life (and, perhaps less tactfully, in my friends' lives). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was a good enough writer to write a given doc myself, or if I should try to outsource it. So, I <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/jad/attempted_telekinesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sat there kind-of-writing it</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/jad/attempted_telekinesis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) while also fretting about whether the task was correct.
<ul>
<li>(Solution: Take a minute out to think through heuristics. Then, either: (1) write the post at full speed; or (2) try to outsource it; or (3) write full force <em>for some fixed time period</em>, and then pause and evaluate.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I wasn&rsquo;t sure (back in early 2012) that CFAR was worthwhile. So, I kind-of worked on it.</li>
<li>An old friend came to my door unexpectedly, and I was tempted to hang out with her, but I also thought I should finish my work. So I kind-of hung out with her while feeling bad and distracted about my work.</li>
<li>A friend of mine, when teaching me math, seems to mumble <em>specifically those words that he doesn&rsquo;t expect me to understand</em> (in a sort of compromise between saying them and not saying them)&hellip;</li>
<li>Duncan <a href="http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/blog/quittability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/blog/quittability" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) that novice Parkour students are unable to safely undertake certain sorts of jumps, because they risk aborting the move mid-stream, after the <em>actual</em> last safe stopping point (apparently kind-of-attempting these jumps is more dangerous than either attempting, or not attempting the jumps)</li>
<li>It is said that start-up founders need to be irrationally certain that their startup will succeed, lest they be unable to do more than kind-of work on it&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, it seems to me that often there are two different actions that would make sense under two different models, and we are uncertain which model is true&hellip; and so we find ourselves taking an intermediate of half-speed action&hellip; even when that action makes no sense under any probabilistic mixture of the two models.</p>

<p>This is actually generalisable. People with expertise in any sufficiently complicated domain will always explain their expertise with things like: &ldquo;Well, do X.

<blockquote>
<p>Think about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re cycling, but this isn&rsquo;t going to be of much help when you&rsquo;re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you&rsquo;re telling them to &ldquo;BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there will be people who say that if you just explain better, if you could find the right words to talk to your students, you can teach them to ride bikes. If you happen to believe this … well, I urge you to test this theory yourself. Go find a couple of kids (or adults!) who haven&rsquo;t yet learned to ride a bike and see if you can teach them &mdash; through the power of your explanations alone! &mdash; how to cycle without scraping their shins. And if you are successful, be critical with yourself: how much of your success is due to the bike rider figuring it out on their own? And how much of it is due to your verbal instructions?</p>
<p>This explanation bit deserves some attention. In pedagogy, this is known as &lsquo;<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transmissionism</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://andymatuschak.org/books/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)&rsquo;, and it is regarded amongst serious educators with the same sort of derision you and I might have about flat-earth theories today. It goes something like this: some people believe that it is possible to teach technique by explaining things to others. They think that if you can find just the right combinations of words with the right sorts of analogies; if you can really break things down into the right level of atomic details, things will magically click in their students&rsquo;s heads and they will succeed. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>How do you teach tacit knowledge? How do you teach bike riding, for that matter?</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I taught myself how to ride a bike … by accident. And then I taught my sisters and then my cousin and then another kid in the neighbourhood who was interested but a little scared. They were zooming around in about an hour each. The steps were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a small bike, much smaller than the body of your learner, and therefore not far off the ground. This is useful for the learner because they will be able to put their feet down and save themselves at any moment. It&rsquo;s also less scary to be not far off the ground.</li>
<li>Have them push with their legs and go forward a short distance, again with their feet only inches off the ground. Do this repeatedly, by pushing off, putting both feet down, then stopping and repeating.</li>
<li>Make the pushes harder and the distances longer. Eventually, they will spend tens of seconds gliding with their feet held up. The goal here is have them learn how it feels like to balance on a bike.</li>
<li>On one of those glides, once they feel ready (and likely a little bored &mdash; the point is to get them to do step 3 so many times that they&rsquo;re feeling secure and eager to move on) &mdash; well, once you reach that point, tell them to start peddling.</li>
<li>Voilà. You have a bicycling kid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how little verbal instruction is involved. What is more important is emulation, and action &mdash; that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.</p>
<p>In other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.</p>

<h3 id="tacit-knowledge-in-knowledge-work">Tacit knowledge in knowledge work</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In my previous job, my technical lead, Hieu, had an uncanny ability to sit in on requirements meetings and, within minutes, sketch out a program structure that would be the simplest possible solution with the fewest moving parts. That sketch was often the one we ended up implementing, and yet I noticed that Hieu always left enough wiggle room for the inevitable changes that came with any software project. (To be clear, he usually implemented a throwaway prototype to confirm the sketch, before passing on the design). When I designed implementations, something always had to be redesigned later. I simply wasn&rsquo;t as good. Eventually, I asked him how he did this, and tried multiple times to get it out of him over the years we worked together. Our conversations would inevitably go something like the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo; Hieu would begin, &ldquo;When you hear there is an external API, you should focus your program around that because there is a lot of risk there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah but then why didn&rsquo;t you worry about the calendar API?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because I&rsquo;ve worked with it before and I think it is easy to implement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why focus so much on Firebase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we want to use it as a database layer. Quite risky ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So always focus on a core layer first, because more important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Try to focus on the most dangerous bits first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how come you didn&rsquo;t worry about the inventory API? We&rsquo;ve never integrated with that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya that one not that important now I think. The client might change it later. Or maybe our feature is going to change. We do the basics first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought back to my Viki days, when I was a software engineering intern and was writing software tests for the first time. A senior software engineer took a few seconds to look at about a hundred lines of code I&rsquo;d written, and said &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not good, this would be a problem later. Structure it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him how he knew, within five seconds, that it was bad. He gave me a long explanation about software engineering principles. I waved him away and asked how he did it in five seconds. He said &ldquo;Well, it just felt right. Ok, let&rsquo;s go to lunch, you can fix it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this Viki episode in my post about perceptual learning. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that Hieu or the senior software engineer couldn&rsquo;t explain their judgment, or that they couldn&rsquo;t make explicit the principles they used to evaluate the tradeoffs between a dozen or so variables: they could, even if terribly. My point is that their explanations would not lead me to the same ability that they had.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Well, take a look at the conversation again. When I pushed these people on their judgments, they would try to explain in terms of principles or heuristics. But the more I pushed, the more exceptions and caveats and potential gotchas I unearthed.</p>
<p>This is actually generalisable. People with expertise in any sufficiently complicated domain will always explain their expertise with things like: &ldquo;Well, do X. Except when you see Y, then do Z, because A. And if you see B, then do P. But if you see A and C but not B, then do Q, because reason D. And then there are weird situations where you do Z but then see thing C emerge, then you should switch to Q.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if you push further, eventually they might say &ldquo;Ahh, it just feels right. Do it long enough and it&rsquo;ll feel right to you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually I realised that the way to learn Hieu&rsquo;s techniques was to copy him: to design some software and then ask for his feedback. And I realised that if you ever hear someone explaining things in terms of a long list of caveats, the odds are good that you&rsquo;re looking at tacit knowledge in action.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is actually well established in the study of expertise. It has also been written about, many times, by practitioners in other fields. As an example, here&rsquo;s surgeon Atul Gawande on appendicitis surgery:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Say you&rsquo;ve got a patient who needs surgery for appendicitis. These days, surgeons will typically do a laparoscopic appendectomy. You slide a small camera—a laparoscope—into the abdomen through a quarter-inch incision near the belly button, insert a long grasper through an incision beneath the waistline, and push a device for stapling and cutting through an incision in the left lower abdomen. Use the grasper to pick up the finger-size appendix, fire the stapler across its base and across the vessels feeding it, drop the severed organ into a plastic bag, and pull it out. Close up, and you&rsquo;re done. That&rsquo;s how you like it to go, anyway. But often it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Even before you start, you need to make some judgments. Unusual anatomy, severe obesity, or internal scars from previous abdominal surgery could make it difficult to get the camera in safely; you don&rsquo;t want to poke it into a loop of intestine. You have to decide which camera-insertion method to use—there&rsquo;s a range of options—or whether to abandon the high-tech approach and do the operation the traditional way, with a wide-open incision that lets you see everything directly. If you do get your camera and instruments inside, you may have trouble grasping the appendix. Infection turns it into a fat, bloody, inflamed worm that sticks to everything around it—bowel, blood vessels, an ovary, the pelvic sidewall—and to free it you have to choose from a variety of tools and techniques. You can use a long cotton-tipped instrument to try to push the surrounding attachments away. You can use electrocautery, a hook, a pair of scissors, a sharp-tip dissector, a blunt-tip dissector, a right-angle dissector, or a suction device. You can adjust the operating table so that the patient&rsquo;s head is down and his feet are up, allowing gravity to pull the viscera in the right direction. Or you can just grab whatever part of the appendix is visible and pull really hard.</p>
<p>Once you have the little organ in view, you may find that appendicitis was the wrong diagnosis. It might be a tumor of the appendix, Crohn&rsquo;s disease, or an ovarian condition that happened to have inflamed the nearby appendix. Then you&rsquo;d have to decide whether you need additional equipment or personnel—maybe it&rsquo;s time to enlist another surgeon.</p>
<p>Over time, you learn how to head off problems, and, when you can&rsquo;t, you arrive at solutions with less fumbling and more assurance. After eight years, I&rsquo;ve performed more than two thousand operations. Three-quarters have involved my specialty, endocrine surgery—surgery for endocrine organs such as the thyroid, the parathyroid, and the adrenal glands. The rest have involved everything from simple biopsies to colon cancer. For my specialized cases, I&rsquo;ve come to know most of the serious difficulties that could arise, and have worked out solutions. For the others, I&rsquo;ve gained confidence in my ability to handle a wide range of situations, and to improvise when necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice how Gawande includes all sorts of caveats in his explanation of his expertise. This is probably tacit knowledge in action. Learning this type of complicated judgment — this instantaneous solution selection that happens to balance dozens of considerations against each other — this is what is valuable to learn. And it is almost impossible to learn it through explanation alone.</p>

<h3 id="can-tacit-knowledge-be-made-explicit">Can tacit knowledge be made explicit?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is worth it to re-examine that last sentence, above. <em>Could it &mdash; in principle &mdash; be possible to externalise tacit knowledge into a list of instructions?</em> [&hellip;]</p>
<p>The consensus answer to that question seems to be: &ldquo;Yes, in principle it is possible to do so. In practice it is very difficult.&rdquo; My take on this is that it is <em>so</em> difficult that we shouldn&rsquo;t even bother; assuming that you are reading this because you want to get good in your career, you should give up on turning tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and just go after tacit knowledge itself.</p>
<p>Why do we know this?</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a bunch of organisations &mdash; amongst them the US military &mdash; commissioned a number of studies to look into the possibility of building out all sorts of expert systems to augment or replace human agents. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>What many researchers found in the wake of that fad was that it is extremely difficult to encode <em>all</em> the possible branches and gotchas and nuances from a human expert into an expert system.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>(Wikipedia calls this problem the &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#Disadvantages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge acquisition problem</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#Disadvantages" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)&rsquo;, which is a nice way of putting it; it was what ultimately caused expert systems to decline in popularity). As people rapidly discovered, it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to get the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; out of experts&rsquo;s heads in the first place.</p>
<p>But there are other objections, of course. Klein &mdash; now considered one of the pioneers of the Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) [<a href="/posts/6eb374ad-69aa-476d-b1d8-02714ffc094f/">Naturalistic decision making</a>] branch of psychology &mdash; likes to say that over-reliance on procedures makes human operators fragile (Chapter 15, <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65229.Sources_of_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source of Power</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65229.Sources_of_Power" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)</em>). In other words, giving people a list of procedures to execute, blindly [or via <a href="/posts/5a824b91-5b0e-4e8e-9946-c7bd0d17d202/">Learned blankness</a>], denies them the ability to build expertise, which in turns prevents them from doing the sorts of creative problem solving that is common amongst expert operators. It also means that when something goes drastically wrong &mdash; and something <em>always</em> goes drastically wrong in the real world &mdash; they would not be able to adapt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; I hear you say &mdash; &ldquo;What about the field of deliberate practice? Isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> the predominant subfield most concerned with the development of expertise?&rdquo; And the answer to that is <em>no</em>, it is not.</p>
<p>In my review of Ericssons' <a href="https://commoncog.com/peak-book-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Peak</em></a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/peak-book-summary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) [ TODO: Add citation for peak. ], and in my summary of <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Problems with Deliberate Practice</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://commoncog.com/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) [ (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chin 2019</a>) ], I explained that deliberate practice is defined as possible <em>only</em> in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice <strong>can only exist in fields like music and math and chess</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Anders Ericsson lays out this narrow definition in <em>Peak</em>, and then does a cop-out, arguing that while he hasn&rsquo;t studied practice outside of such domains, the ideas from deliberate practice may be applied to pedagogically less established fields. But Ericsson is well aware that NDM methods exist &mdash; he was one of the editors, alongside many names from the NDM community &mdash; who worked on the <em><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/my/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/cambridge-handbook-expertise-and-expert-performance-2nd-edition?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781316502617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge Handbook for Expertise and Expert Performance</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.cambridge.org/my/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/cambridge-handbook-expertise-and-expert-performance-2nd-edition?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781316502617" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so if you are a programmer, or designer, or businessperson, an investor or a writer reading about deliberate practice, you may be asking: &ldquo;Well, what about <em>my</em> field? What if there are no established pedagogical techniques for me?&rdquo; And if you have started to ask this question, then you have begun travelling a more interesting path; this is really the right question to ask.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that the field of NDM is a lot more useful if you find yourself in one of these fields. The process of learning tacit knowledge looks something like the following: you find a master, you work under them for a few years, and you learn the ropes through emulation, feedback, and osmosis &mdash; <em>not</em> through deliberate practice. (Think: Warren Buffett and the years he spent under Benjamin Graham, for instance). The field of NDM is focused on ways to make this practice more effective. And I think much of the world pays too much attention to deliberate practice and to cognitive bias research, and not enough to tacit knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p>If tacit knowledge exists &mdash; and I believe it does &mdash; then the most useful tools about skill acquisition will come out of the fields that study it. Late last year, the NDM community got together and published <em><a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198795872.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198795872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oxford Handbook of Expertise</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198795872.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198795872" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>).</em> It is the single most comprehensive overview of the field that we know today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course there will still be many people with intense, unsatisfied purposiveness who will blindly pursue wealth-unless they can find some plausible substitute. But the rest of us will no longer be under any obligation to applaud and encourage them. For we shall inquire more curiously than is safe to-day into the true character of this &ldquo;purposiveness&rdquo; with which in varying degrees Nature has endowed almost all of us. For purposiveness means that we are more concerned with the remote future results of our actions than with their own quality or their immediate effects on our own environment. The &ldquo;purposive&rdquo; man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat&rsquo;s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens' kittens, and so on forward forever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.</p>
<p>Let me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,&rdquo; said a meek voce outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,&rdquo; the Professor said to the children, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?&rdquo; The tailor had come in while he was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a-doubling so many years, you see,&rdquo; the tailor replied, a little grufy, &ldquo;and I think I&rsquo;d like the money now. It&rsquo;s two thousand pound, it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you&rsquo;d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d care about being a king,&rdquo; the man said thoughtfully. &ldquo;But it dew sound a powerful sight o' money! Well, I think I&rsquo;ll wait-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will!&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?&rdquo; Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, my child!&rdquo; the Professor replied emphatically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it&rsquo;s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="/posts/d636dfa7-428d-457c-8db6-15fa61e03bef/">Tacit knowledge</a> is the &ldquo;between-the-lines&rdquo; know-how. It&rsquo;s what separates proficient individuals from experts. Traditionally it&rsquo;s acquired by doing the relevant thing for a long time. However, that takes a long time. Instead, recognize that expertise, and tacit knowledge by extension, boils down to <a href="/posts/b481f4e5-63b4-4455-8406-49825121b06c/">pattern matching</a>, specifically <a href="/posts/4a42aa6f-413f-4144-86df-5c0f0b174777/">Recognition-primed decision</a> making, and work to <a href="/posts/4a42aa6f-413f-4144-86df-5c0f0b174777/#how-to-improve-at-id-4a42aa6f-413f-4144-86df-5c0f0b174777-recognition-primed-decision-making">improve</a> this ability through simulations. <a href="/posts/31152f53-1769-454c-be11-643a5405eb5d/#choosing-good-simulations">Prefer simulations that already exist</a>.

<p>What about establishing a hierarchy of skills and progressing through them? That&rsquo;s how the schooling I&rsquo;m familiar with did things. It turns out that&rsquo;s <a href="/posts/f7eeed27-4fdb-4ebc-8ac0-8b2c2e58dcbb/">not an effective method</a> for developing expertise.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tacit knowledge is more useful than deliberate practice when the subject you&rsquo;re trying to learn isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;well defined&rdquo;. &ldquo;&hellip; deliberate practice is defined as possible <em>only</em> in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice <strong>can only exist in fields like music and math and chess</strong>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tacit knowledge in action looks like a long list of caveats</li>

Summary An exercise in which participants create a three-layered map:
Locator map (Staff Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Path) Topographical map (Staff Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Path) Treasure map (Staff Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Path) Thoughts The exercise, as written, doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the full depth of each of the three maps. As an example, drawing the locator map in this way &amp;ndash; as a literal map &amp;ndash; limits the nested nature (i.e. you within your team, your team/org within your company, your company within your users' needs, your company within the space of current and future competition).</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/2c536d79-3ebe-4b38-9193-78ec80ed3772/">Will Larson</a>, (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Larson 2022</a>)</p>

<p>The exercise, as written, doesn&rsquo;t capture the full depth of each of the three maps. As an example, drawing the locator map in this way &ndash; as a literal map &ndash; limits the nested nature (i.e. you within your team, your team/org within your company, your company within your users' needs, your company within the space of current and future competition).</p>
<p>Then again, the author notes the need for additional time and perhaps the exercise is most effective in a simpler form. That is, maybe it&rsquo;s better <em>not</em> to go into such detail for each of the three maps. The presenter and participant&rsquo;s have limited time. Planting a seed of &ldquo;oh, maybe I could think about X in a different way&rdquo; is still a great outcome (<a href="/posts/3f33e96a-915a-4561-be68-4cef17b84792/">Iterative development</a>).</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The second chapter [of <a href="/posts/bc1937f1-31ce-41cc-ba0b-dedaac9334b5/">Tanya Reilly | The Staff Engineer&rsquo;s Path</a>] is focused on the idea of creating three maps to better understand your engineering organization: a locator map (where are you?), a topographical map (how hard is it to go nearby places?), and a treasure map (where are the places that are really worth going?). I thought this would be an interesting exercise to run as a group, with each of us taking ten minutes to create our own three maps, then sharing them out.</p>
<p>The instructions we followed were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using one color, create your locator map, describing the key teams (e.g. Data Engineering, Quality Assurance, Customer Success, etc) and platforms (e.g. Content API, CI/CD, user authentication, analytics, etc) that you work with</li>
<li>Using a second color, add topographical details to your locator map: draw in mountains where there is friction or little communication, add rivers where there&rsquo;s a fast path to collaboration</li>
<li>Using a third color, add treasures: where are the very high potential projects, capabilities, initiatives and relationships that could unlock something special? (Some folks also added hazards to their map, which are sort of anti-treasures. Generally any hazard can be converted into a treasure with a bit of creativity, so I think they are legitimate treasure candidates.)</li>
<li>Explain your map!</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, this was a fun exercise, and the shareout was exceptionally interesting. That said, if I were to try this again I would probably try it in three phases, along the lines of: first session, draft your locator map, finalize it for the second session; second session, draft your topographical map, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the powerful things about maps is they contain so much data (this is one of the reasons what <a href="https://felt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felt</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://felt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) is doing is so interesting to me), but I also found that trying to work through both the nouns and their physical relationship to each other was too much to get right in one pass. You really need time to iterate before the map gels. For most folks it was obvious within a few minutes that their map was wrong somehow, and doing the exercise within one session didn&rsquo;t provide enough time to fix. Conversely, maybe that&rsquo;s part of the value: sometimes an exercise that makes it abundantly clear that you can&rsquo;t do a good job is a powerful way to break through uncertainty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>As you grow in seniority, making a real impact will mean being able to put your work in a bigger context, and recognizing that your point of view is heavily influenced by where you&rsquo;re standing.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone else you work with will have their own point of view too: their &ldquo;You are here&rdquo; marker will be somewhere else on the map. If you want to make good decisions, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to see from some of those other points of view.</p>
<p>The more time you spend absorbed in any domain and learning the nuances of the work at your scope, the richer and more complex it will become for you. As you understand the people, the problems, and the goals, you&rsquo;ll become more focused on them. That focus brings depth and understanding, but it comes with some risks, especially for a staff engineer.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prioritizing badly</p>
<p>When everyone around you cares about the same set of things, it&rsquo;s easy to magnify the importance of those things. The problems that exist outside your group can start to appear simple or unimportant by comparison. [&hellip;]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Losing empathy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to overfocus and forget that the rest of the world exists, or start thinking of other technology areas as trivial compared to your rich, nuanced domain. [<a href="/posts/16937276-fd62-4d50-90ef-cdf5ab036442/">John Salvatier | Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail</a>]. [&hellip;]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuning out the background noise</p>
<p>If one failure mode is your team&rsquo;s concerns seeming more important than everyone else&rsquo;s, another is the exact opposite: you stop noticing problems at all! If you&rsquo;ve been working around the same mucky configuration file or broken deploy process for months, you might get so used to it that you stop thinking of it as something you need to fix. Similarly, you might not notice that something that started out as just slightly annoying has slowly become worse. Maybe a problem is close to becoming a crisis, but you don&rsquo;t even notice it anymore, so you can&rsquo;t be objective about how quickly you need to react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgetting what the work is for</p>
<p>Being in your silo can mean that you lose your connection to what&rsquo;s going on elsewhere in the company. If your group originally took on some project to solve a larger goal, the project might still be ongoing even though the goal no longer matters or has already been solved in some other way. If you&rsquo;re working only on your own little part of a project, it&rsquo;s easy to stop thinking about what the project is for. You can slip into a world where everyone does their own little part and nobody feels like they&rsquo;re responsible for the end result. You can lose sight of the ethics of what you&rsquo;re doing, too, and find yourself working on something that you wouldn&rsquo;t really be OK with if you stepped back and thought about the whole picture.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When the new person on your team looks at an architectural tangle or a pile of technical debt, they have no historical context. As my colleague, Dan Na, says, a new person can always see the problems. They haven&rsquo;t been around for the gradual change and the boiling frogs: they&rsquo;re just seeing the raw situation as it is. Without preconceptions, they&rsquo;re free to look around and ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s really happening here? Is any of this working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&hellip;] as a staff engineer, you should try to have this perspective all the time. You need to be able to look at your own group as if you weren&rsquo;t part of it and to be honest about what you see. Do your technical decisions only make sense to people who have forgotten that there&rsquo;s a world outside your team? If you all stopped doing the work you&rsquo;re doing, how long would it be before other people would notice or care?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seeking out peers in other groups is an important part of your job. Build friendly relationships with other staff engineers. Get to a point where you can speak the truth to one another, and it won&rsquo;t be contentious, because you&rsquo;ve built up so much goodwill. This includes understanding any negative opinions that other teams hold about your group— if you start seeing what&rsquo;s valid about their comments, you&rsquo;ll do better work. Think of the other staff engineers as your team, just as much as any team you&rsquo;re part of.</p>
<p>Go beyond engineering: build relationships with product folks, customer support, administrative staff, and more. If your work affects them or their work affects you, go be friendly and understand their point of view. It will give you a whole new way of thinking about what&rsquo;s important to your department or your business.</p>

<p>As an engineer, it&rsquo;s easy to get absorbed in technology.

Ultimately you&rsquo;re here to help your employer achieve its goals. You should know what those goals are. You should know what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] &ldquo;the objectives that are always true&rdquo; [&hellip;] are the needs of your company that are so obvious, they&rsquo;re only really stated if they&rsquo;re in danger. The product or service that your organization provides should work. Its customers should want to use it. Deploying it shouldn&rsquo;t be painfully slow. Know your implicit goals as well as the explicit ones.</p>
<p>As time passes, your company&rsquo;s priorities will change and parts of your map will fog up again. To stay up to date with what&rsquo;s important, pay attention to all-hands meetings for your group and others, ask for skip-level one-on-ones with your manager&rsquo;s manager, and find face time with customers or teams that depend on you. If you don&rsquo;t have business context about why (or whether) your work matters, ask for it.</p>

<p>In computer science, the method of contraction hierarchies is a speed-up technique for finding the shortest-path [<a href="/posts/555129b5-299e-4605-a2cd-9f77ebcede3d/">Shortest path problem</a>] in a graph [<a href="/posts/8bff4dfc-8073-4d45-ab89-7b3f97323327/">Graph</a>]. The most intuitive applications are car-navigation systems: a user wants to drive from \(A\) to \(B\) using the quickest possible route. The metric optimized here is the travel time. Intersections are represented by vertices [<a href="/posts/1b2526af-676d-4c0f-aa85-1ba05b8e7a93/">Vertex</a>], the road sections connecting them by edges. The edge weights represent the time it takes to drive along this segment of the road. A path from \(A\) to \(B\) is a sequence of edges (road sections); the shortest path is the one with the minimal sum of edge weights among all possible paths. The shortest path in a graph can be computed using Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm but, given that road networks consist of tens of millions of vertices, this is impractical. Contraction hierarchies is a speed-up method optimized to exploit properties of graphs representing road networks. The speed-up is achieved by creating shortcuts in a preprocessing phase which are then used during a shortest-path query to skip over &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; vertices. This is based on the observation that road networks are highly hierarchical. Some intersections, for example highway junctions, are &ldquo;more important&rdquo; and higher up in the hierarchy than for example a junction leading into a dead end. Shortcuts can be used to save the precomputed distance between two important junctions such that the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t have to consider the full path between these junctions at query time. Contraction hierarchies do not know about which roads humans consider &ldquo;important&rdquo; (e.g. highways), but they are provided with the graph as input and are able to assign importance to vertices using heuristics.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>The contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Consider two large cities connected by a highway. Between these two cities, there is a multitude of junctions leading to small villages and suburbs. Most drivers want to get from one city to the other – maybe as part of a larger route – and not take one of the exits on the way. In the graph representing this road layout, each intersection is represented by a node and edges are created between neighboring intersections. To calculate the distance between these two cities, the algorithm has to traverse all the edges along the way, adding up their length. Precomputing this distance once and storing it in an additional edge created between the two large cities will save calculations each time this highway has to be evaluated in a query. This additional edge is called a &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo; and has no counterpart in the real world. The contraction hierarchies algorithm has no knowledge about road types but is able to determine which shortcuts have to be created using the graph alone as input.</p>

<p>[Contraction hierarchies'] basic ingredient is the contraction of a node \(v\): The node \(v\) is removed from the graph, but for any pair of arcs \((u,v)\), \((v,w)\) such that \((u,v,w)\) is a shortest path, a shortcut arc \((u,w)\) with the cost of \((u,v,w)\) is inserted. The contracted node \(v\) is called the midpoint of the shortcut. The remaining graph has one less node, a changed set of arcs (some dropped, some added), and the same shortest paths between any two remaining nodes.</p>

</figure>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;] for symmetric graphs like the ones we are considering, a backward search (reversing edge directions) on \(G_{down}\) is the same as an upward search on \(G_{up}\). So from both our source and target nodes, we can perform a standard Dijkstra search on the \(G_{up}\) graph.</p>
<p>From our example above, let&rsquo;s say our source node is \(B\) and our target node is \(G\). Then the two respective search spaces on \(G_{up}\) will look as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-15_16-54-11_upward-source.png"/> 
</figure>

<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-15_16-57-46_upward-target.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Although we said that <em>every</em> edge in \(G*\) is either in the \(G_{up}\) or the \(G_{down}\) graph, not all edges [&hellip;] will be relevant in the search space from a given node.</p>
<p>In our example above, for example, the edge \(E,D\) does exist in \(G_{up}\) since \(E\) was contracted before \(D\). But, because there is no path to \(E\) in either of the two searches from \(B\) or \(G\), we would never need to consider the edge \(E,D\).</p>
<p>Then on both of these upward graphs, we run a <strong><em>complete</em></strong> Dijkstra search, meaning that all nodes in <em>both</em> subgraphs must be settled. And it should be evident that in both searches, the number of settled nodes and relaxed edges is significantly reduced than if we were searching on the entire \(G*\) graph.</p>
<p>Moreover, because we have a complete ordering of nodes, the two search spaces can both be conceptualized as <em>DAGs</em> (directed acyclic graphs [<a href="/posts/ee7fcae8-6322-4b71-91b0-704b7c21ae3a/">Directed acyclic graph</a>]) and are inherently topologically sorted [<a href="/posts/518c35ac-35d7-4c12-9522-efb13e5be1e8/">Topological order</a>]. Consider the redrawing of the two searches that emphasizes this hierarchical nature of the contraction order:</p>

<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-15_17-07-44_dag-target.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>In any case, after running two complete Dijkstra searches on \(G_{up}\) from both the source and target, we have a set of nodes that are settled in both searches. We denote this set as \(L\).</p>
<p>Continuing with our example from above, we see the nodes in \(L\) shaded in red with their corresponding shortest path scores:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-15_17-07-19_query-scores.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>This means the shortest path from \(B\) to \(G\) is 10 and goes through node \(H\).</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="unpacking-the-shortest-path-from-a-shortcut">Unpacking the shortest path from a shortcut</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re able to compute the <em>length</em> of the shortest path, but we still need to unpack the actual arcs used on that path. We can handle this during the stage of contraction when shortcut edges are added. When we add a shortcut edge from \(u\) to \(w\) during the contraction of \(v\), we store a shortcut pointer to \(v\).</p>
<p>We then begin unpacking the shortest path on the G*<sub>U</sub> graph from the highest order node, in both directions. We back-trace parent edge pointers as in a regular Dijkstra algorithm, and if the parent edge has a shortcut pointer, we replace the parent edge with the shortcut edge, and continue to recursively unpack the full path.</p>
<p>Our example query above didn&rsquo;t end up using any shortcut edges in \(G*\), but consider if we had queried the shortest path from node \(A\) to \(G\). Then, we would certainly use the shortcut edge \(A,H\). And since \(A\) is the highest-ordered node in terms of contraction time, we can visualize the &lsquo;unpacking&rsquo; of shortcut edges as:</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-node-order">Choosing a node order</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Our query is correct no matter the order in which nodes were contracted, but a good node ordering has major implications for the performance of the queries. The order in which nodes are contracted affects the shortcut edges that do or don&rsquo;t get added in G*. And as it&rsquo;s been mentioned before, too many shortcut edges means too dense a G* graph and slower queries as a result.</p>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Lazarsfeld n.d.-a</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cost-functions">Cost functions</h4>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Edge difference</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the main function used to determine this cost involves simulating the contraction of each node. Given that all edges incident to a node are removed during contraction, we&rsquo;re interested in the edge difference of a node, which is the difference between the number of original edges removed and the number of shortcut edges added.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Using our original, arbitrary node ordering, we only added 3 shortcut edges. In the example, B was the first node we contracted, and it didn&rsquo;t require any shortcuts to be added. In other words, the edge difference of B is -3.</p>
<p>But what if we had first contracted J first? Compare what choosing J over B looks like:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-16_16-14-51_order-example-1.png"/> 
</figure>

<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="/ox-hugo/2023-06-16_16-15-04_order-example-3.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>So clearly J has a much greater edge difference than B, and so J is less attractive to contract early on.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But consider that after we begin contracting nodes, the edge difference for other nodes can be affected. If we wanted to strictly adhere to an ordering based on edge difference, we would need to recompute the edge difference for every remaining node in the graph after each contraction. Of course, this would end up taking quadratic time, so it isn&rsquo;t feasible. Instead, we can use the lazy update heuristic [&hellip;]</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Before contracting the next minimum node, we recompute its edge difference. If it&rsquo;s still the smallest in the priority queue [<a href="/posts/6f787120-13bb-405a-bfca-060df6d80b14/">Priority queue</a>], we can go ahead and actually contract it. If its edge difference is no longer the min, then we update its cost and rebalance our [priority queue]. We then check the next minimum node and continue this process.</p>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Lazarsfeld n.d.-a</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<!--list-separator-->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contracted neighbors</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] we might consider the idea of uniformity to be important when contracting nodes. This means varying the location of nodes in terms of their contraction order.</p>
<p>Conceptually, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to contract all nodes in a small region of the graph consecutively because we could risk adding too many wasteful shortcuts. In our original example, we had a pretty good ordering partly because nodes in different parts of the graph were contracted each round.</p>
<p>So an additional term to consider is the number of contracted neighbors each node has. This just involves counting the number of neighbors in the original graph that have already been contracted. When dealing with multiple terms like contracted neighbors and edge difference to determine cost, we would use a linear combination of terms.</p>

<h4 id="make-most-anki-questions-and-answers-as-atomic-as-possible">Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, both the question and answer express just one idea. As an example, when I was learning the Unix command line, I entered the question: &ldquo;How to create a soft link from linkname to filename?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;ln -s filename linkname&rdquo;. Unfortunately, I routinely got this question wrong.</p>
<p>The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?&rdquo; Answer: &ldquo;ln -s …&rdquo;. And the second piece was: &ldquo;When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?&rdquo; Answer: &ldquo;filename linkname&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Breaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got right** An even more atomic version would be to break the first question into &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Unix command to create a link?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the option to the ln command to create a soft link?&rdquo; In practice, I&rsquo;ve known for years that ln is the command to create a link, and so this wasn&rsquo;t necessary.. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix soft link in practice, I knew how to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s responsible for this effect. I suspect it&rsquo;s partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn&rsquo;t focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn&rsquo;t learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus.</p>
<p>In general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It&rsquo;s a powerful pattern for question refactoring.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t also retain some version of the original question. I still want to know how to create a soft link in Unix, and so it&rsquo;s worth keeping the original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from simple atomic facts to more complex ideas.</p>
<p>Incidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the following question, from the field of general relativity: &ldquo;What is the dr2 term in the Robertson-Walker metric?&rdquo; Answer: dr2/(1-kr^2). Now, unless you&rsquo;ve studied general relativity that question probably seems quite opaque. It&rsquo;s a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you know what the Robertson-Walker metric is, what dr2 means, what k means, and so on. But conditional on that background knowledge, it&rsquo;s quite an atomic question and answer.</p>
<p>One benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply crystallizes the distinct things you&rsquo;ve learned. Personally, I find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically) find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I didn&rsquo;t initially anticipate. And that&rsquo;s well worth the trouble.</p>

<h4 id="cultivate-strategies-for-elaborative-encoding-forming-rich-associations">Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding / forming rich associations</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This is really a meta-strategy, i.e., a strategy for forming strategies. One simple example strategy is to use multiple variants of the &ldquo;same&rdquo; question. For instance, I mentioned earlier my two questions: &ldquo;What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?&rdquo; And: &ldquo;Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?&rdquo; Logically, these two questions are obviously closely related. But in terms of how memory works, they are different, causing associations on very different triggers.</p>

Summary On Spaced repetition.
Thoughts Notes There are two main limiting factors to effective spaced repetition:
Habit Formation
For spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit. I drill flashcards every day as part of my morning routine. But habit formation is difficult, doubly so for people who have ADHD or are low in conscientiousness.
The reason you have to do it every day is that the spaced repetition algorithm schedules the reviews for you, freeing you from having to do that manually.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/f30176d6-adc0-43be-bc31-d4ab25bfe772/">Fernando Borretti</a>, (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Borretti 2023</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two main limiting factors to effective spaced repetition:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Habit Formation</p>
<p>For spaced repetition to be useful, it has to be a habit. I drill flashcards every day as part of my morning routine. But habit formation is difficult, doubly so for people who have ADHD or are low in conscientiousness.</p>
<p>The reason you have to do it every day is that the spaced repetition algorithm schedules the reviews for you, freeing you from having to do that manually. But you don&rsquo;t know what cards are due in a given day until you open the app. And if you skip a day, those cards pile up and are due the next day.</p>
<p>A common failure mode (and I did this more than once, before I got the hang of it) is to use Anki for two weeks, then drop it, and pick it back up six months later only to find you have 600 cards due for review. This is not encouraging, and it defeats the point of spaced repetition, which is to review the cards on the intervals the algorithm chooses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card-Writing Skills</p>
<p>Writing effective flashcards is a skill that took me a while to acquire. Many of the cards I wrote in the first four or six months of using spaced repetition consistently turned out pretty much useless, and this can be frustrating. The main reason to write this post was to communicate the lessons I learnt so you can jump in to using spaced repetition effectively from the start.</p>
<p>One reason this can be frustrating is you&rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you&rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn&rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.</p>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<h4 id="understand-first">Understand First</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to memorize what you don&rsquo;t understand. The concepts should be clear in your head before you try to commit them to memory. &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; can be a fuzzy thing. What I tend to do is: dig, expand, and clarify the text until I&rsquo;m comfortable I have a good grasp of this region of the concept graph, and then write the flashcards.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="be-honest">Be Honest</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The software doesn&rsquo;t know whether you recalled something correctly or not. You are only accountable to yourself. If you recalled something wrong, or not quite right, err on the side of caution and mark it forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="keep-it-fun">Keep It Fun</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This is <em>crucial</em> to maintaining the habit. If reviewing flashcards feels like a chore, you will become averse to doing it.</p>
<p>I used to frequently have this problem. I solved it in a few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having a diverse knowledge base you&rsquo;re drilling helps, so you are not bored by going through the same topic for a long time. Typically, spaced repetition software will shuffle the cards, so that if you&rsquo;re drilling all the cards across all decks, you will be surprised often.</li>
<li>A common source of frustration is cards that are too long to recall quickly, and thus feel like a chore. Break big cards down into smaller cards. It feels good to be able to fly through the cards quickly.</li>
<li>Cards that are difficult to recall are very frustrating. I solved this by applying the rules described in this post.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="repeat-yourself">Repeat Yourself</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Memory is frequency times volume. Individual cards should be extremely brief, but your deck as a whole can be as repetitive as you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="organize-by-source">Organize by Source</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Organize content by source, not topic.</p>
<p>The reason is you&rsquo;ll often bring in information from multiple sources: multiple textbooks, plus Wikipedia, plus lecture notes, etc. Each one of these sources likely has a different way of organizing knowledge.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste time trying to find the perfect ontology.</p>
<p>Make a deck for each source. In the case of textbooks, make a sub-deck for each chapter. In the case of math textbooks, possibly make a sub-sub-deck in each chapter to put theorem cards.</p>
<p>This also makes it easier to keep track of how far along you got into a text.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="write-atomic-flashcards">Write Atomic Flashcards</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Cards should be short. They should refer to as little information as possible. They should be like chemical bonds, linking individual <em>atoms</em> of knowledge.</p>
<p><em>This is the most important thing.</em> By far the worst failure mode is to put too much in a flashcard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two reasons for this rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Larger cards are harder to remember.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s harder to objectively grade yourself: when you reveal the answer, you might have got some things right and some things wrong. If you click forget, you will be over-reviewing the parts you already know. If you click remembered, you will under-review the parts you forgot.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is one exception to this: you can have big cards if you also have smaller cards that add up to the same information. You can think of the larger card as testing that you can collate the information from the smaller cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="write-two-way-questions">Write Two-Way Questions</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When possible, ask questions in two directions.</p>
<p>Whenever you have a term with a definition, the obvious thing to do is to ask for the definition from the term, e.g.:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Q: What is the order of a group?</p>
<p>A: The cardinality of its underlying set.</p>
</div>
<p>But you can also ask for the term from the definition, e.g.:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Q: What is the term for the cardinality of a group?</p>
<p>A: The group&rsquo;s order.</p>
</div>
<p>When you have some notation, like \(\mathbb{R}\) for the real numbers, or \(\dim V\) for the dimension of a vector space, the natural thing to ask is what the notation means.</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Q: What does \(\mathbb{R}\) stand for?</p>
<p>A: The set of real numbers.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also ask the question backwards:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Q: What is the notation for the set of real numbers?</p>
<p>A: \(\mathbb{R}\)R</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="ask-questions-in-multiple-ways">Ask Questions in Multiple Ways</h4>
<p>Ask questions in multiple ways. Ask for formal and informal definitions of terms. Ask for the formal and informal statements of a theorem. Ask questions forwards and backwards. Add contextual questions: &ldquo;what is the intutition for [concept]?&rdquo;. Add questions that link different concepts across your knowledge graph.</p>
<p>The more interlinked your knowledge graph is, the better.</p>
<h4 id="concept-graphs">Concept Graphs</h4>
<p>It can help to visualize the concepts you&rsquo;re acquiring as being like a graph, where each node represents a discrete concept having certain properties, and the edges in the graphs are questions which get you from one concept to another.</p>
<h4 id="learning-hierarchies">Learning Hierarchies</h4>
<p>A lot of knowledge is hierarchical, of the form &ldquo;Foo can be either A, B, or C&rdquo;, or, dually, &ldquo;A is a kind of Foo&rdquo;. By analogy to OOP: these concepts are joined by superclass and subclass relations.</p>
<p>The idea is to ask questons in the top down direction (&ldquo;What are the subclasses of Foo?&quot;) and the bottom-up direction (&ldquo;What is Bar a subclass of?&quot;).</p>
<p>This ties into keeping flashcards atomic. Even when some information is not hierarchical, intrinsically, breaking down large flashcards into smaller flashcards is fundamentally building a hierarchy of flashcards.</p>
<h4 id="learning-sequences">Learning Sequences</h4>
<p>In general, to learn a sequence \((A_{1},\ldots,A_{n})\)(A1​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;,&hellip;,An​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;), you want to generate the following flashcards for each \(i \in \lbrack 1,n\rbrack\)i∈[1,n]:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>What is the \(i\)i-th element?</td>
<td>\(A_{i}\)Ai​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the position of \(A_{i}\)Ai​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;?</td>
<td>\(i\)i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What element comes after \(A_{i}\)Ai​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;?</td>
<td>\(A_{i + 1}\)Ai+1​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What element comes before</td>
<td>\(A_{i - 1}\)Ai−1​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(A_{i}\)Ai​&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;?</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You might also want:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>*test card:</strong> a flashcard asking you to recite the sequence from beginning to end.</li>
<li>A <strong>*cloze sequence:</strong> flashcard with a cloze deletion for each element in the sequence, to fill in the blank given the context.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition#seq-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequence script</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition#seq-script" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) can generate these for you.</p>
<p>How thorough you want to be depends on the nature of the information. Most of the time I use a cloze card and a test card.</p>
<p>Another type of card you might use (I use this to memorize poems) is a card that gives you some context (the previous one or two items in the sequence) and asks you to fill in the blank. For example, if you wanted to learn the sequence (A, B, C, D), you might have these flashcards:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Beginning</em>, &hellip;</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Beginning</em>, A, &hellip;</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A, B, &hellip;</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B, C, &hellip;</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>

A front-end engineer should know a lot about the front-end but should also know something about the backend(s) on which the front-end depends. Senior or staff+ engineers should understand the entire thing as their work will necessarily cross domains and be improved by a wider understanding.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the core challenges of the staff+ engineering path is the unspoken expectation that part of being qualified to be on that path is figuring out how to climb it without much in the way of directions. If you were destined to be a staff+ engineer, conventional wisdom argues, you would figure out how to get there yourself. Needless to say, this is a frustrating and bias-ridden approach to career development. As more and more companies realize the need for staff+ engineers, we as an industry cannot afford to maintain a mysticism about the staff+ engineering career path that ignores the underlying skills that lead to successful technical leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="two-paths">Two Paths</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The staff engineer&rsquo;s path is a little less defined. While many companies now allow engineers to keep growing in seniority without taking on reports, this &ldquo;technical track&rdquo; is still muddy and poorly signposted. Engineers considering this path may have never worked with a staff engineer before, or might have seen such a narrow set of personalities in the role that it seems like unattainable wizardry. (It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s all learnable.) The expectations of the job vary across companies, and, even within a company, the criteria for hiring or promoting staff engineers can be vague and not always actionable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-pillars-of-staff-engineering">The Pillars of Staff Engineering</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll unpack the staff engineer role by looking at what I think of as its three pillars: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Big-picture thinking</p>
<p>Big-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you&rsquo;re working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution</p>
<p>At the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They&rsquo;ll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveling up</p>
<p>Every increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that&rsquo;s your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. This responsibility will include intentional influence through teaching and mentoring, as well as the accidental influence that comes from being a role model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But technical knowledge is not enough. Success and growth at this level means doing more than you can do with technical skills alone. To become adept at big-picture thinking, execute on bigger projects, and level up everyone around you, you&rsquo;re going to need &ldquo;humaning&rdquo; skills, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication and leadership</li>
<li>Navigating complexity</li>
<li>Putting your work in perspective</li>
<li>Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation</li>
<li>Framing a problem so that other people care about it</li>
<li>Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not</li>
</ul>
<p>And a lot more. Check out Camille Fournier&rsquo;s article &ldquo;An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, Beyond Coding&rdquo; [<a href="/posts/9f7ed9dc-46f1-4f12-a87e-cd03005c06dd/">Camille Fournier | An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, beyond Coding</a>].</p>

<p>As your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. Your technical judgment will need to include the reality of the business and whether any given project is worth doing at all. As you increase in seniority, you&rsquo;ll take on bigger projects, projects that can&rsquo;t succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment; your brilliant solutions are just going to cause you frustration if you can&rsquo;t convince the other people on the team that yours is the right path to take. And whether you want to or not, you&rsquo;ll be a role model: other engineers will look to those with the big job titles to understand how to behave. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Leadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such [TODO: LINK]. It can come from designing &ldquo;happy path&rdquo; solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers' code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or from highlighting that a design proposal doesn&rsquo;t meet a genuine business need. Teaching is a form of leadership. Quietly raising everyone&rsquo;s game is leadership. Setting technical direction is leadership. Finally, there&rsquo;s having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people to buy into your plans just because they trust you.</p>

<p>Something like: &ldquo;Senior engineering leadership is indirect&rdquo;, &ldquo;Soft leadership&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Hard leadership&rdquo; being the distinction between telling people what to do (hard, direct) and guiding people to take the path you want them to take (soft, indirect). <a href="/posts/0d00d854-02ca-4b2f-bf1d-8321de9378f8/">The slow knife penetrates the shield</a>. What would you call that? Guiding somene to make a choice on their own that&rsquo;s also the choice you want them to make.

<p>You&rsquo;re in a &ldquo;Technical&rdquo; Role</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and model them when you build something [<a href="/posts/c1e92962-bb77-4da1-a565-dba4d2d29076/">Lead by example</a>]. Your reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better. When you&rsquo;re making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade-offs and help other people understand them too. You need to be able to dive into the details where necessary, ask the right questions, and understand the answers. When arguing for a particular course of action, or a particular change in technical culture, you need to know what you&rsquo;re talking about. So you have to have a solid foundation of technical skills.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;ll write a lot of code. At this level, your goal is to solve problems efficiently [TODO: LINK], and programming will often not be the best use of your time. It may make more sense for you to take on the design or leadership work that only you can do and let others handle the programming. Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer).</p>

<p>When you started out as an engineer, your manager probably told you what to work on and how to approach it. At senior level, maybe your manager advised you on which problems were important to solve, and left it to you to figure out what to do about it. At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what&rsquo;s important just as much as the other way around. As Sabrina Leandro, principal engineer at Intercom, asks, &ldquo;So you know you&rsquo;re supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable. But where do you find this magic backlog of high- impact work that you should be doing?&rdquo; Her answer: &ldquo;You create it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a technical leader, part of a staff engineer&rsquo;s role is to make sure the organization has a good technical direction. Underlying the product or service your organization provides is a host of technical decisions: your architecture, your storage systems, the tools and frameworks you use, and so on. Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down. The job is not to come up with all (or even necessarily any!) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.</p>

<p>Which of the &ldquo;four disciplines&rdquo; do you gravitate toward?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yonatan Zunger, distinguished engineer at Twitter, describes the four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Core technical skills</p>
<p>Coding, litigation, producing content, cooking— whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product management</p>
<p>Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management</p>
<p>The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what&rsquo;s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People management</p>
<p>Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zunger notes that the higher your level, the less your mix of these skills corresponds with your job title: &ldquo;The more senior you get, the more this becomes true, the more and more there is an expectation that you can shift across each of these four kinds of jobs easily and fluidly, and function in all rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your work needs to be important&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean you should only work on the fanciest, most glamorous technologies and VP-sponsored initiatives. The work that&rsquo;s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don&rsquo;t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn&rsquo;t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven&rsquo;t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you&rsquo;re working on is strategically important—and if it&rsquo;s not, do something else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By now, you should have a pretty clear picture of what the scope of your role is, how it&rsquo;s shaped, and what you&rsquo;re working on right now. But are you certain that your picture matches everyone else&rsquo;s? Your manager&rsquo;s and colleagues' expectations may differ wildly from yours on what a staff engineer is, what authority you have to make decisions, and myriad other big questions. If you&rsquo;re joining a company as a staff engineer, it&rsquo;s best to get all of this straightened out up front.</p>
<p>A technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question &ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo; What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don&rsquo;t do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you&rsquo;ll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else&rsquo;s. Better now than at performance review time.</p>

But if that&rsquo;s what the project needs to be successful, consider doing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start with your place in the wider organization and company. Last chapter we talked about your scope, but to truly understand that scope, you need to see what&rsquo;s outside it. What&rsquo;s along the borders? When you zoom way out, how big is your part of the world compared to everywhere else? Think of it like one of those maps that a news station throws up behind the presenter to remind you where a particular place is, and put it in context.</p>
<p>You need the locator map because it&rsquo;s tricky to be objective about any work while you&rsquo;re deep inside it. Unless you can maintain perspective, the concerns and decisions of your local group will feel more important to you than they would if you looked at them on a bigger scale. So we&rsquo;ll try out some techniques for getting that perspective. You&rsquo;ll be honest with yourself about which of the projects you care about would actually show up on a big map of the company, and which ones you wouldn&rsquo;t see unless you zoomed all the way in.</p>

<p>The second map is all about navigating the terrain. If you&rsquo;re setting off across the landscape, you&rsquo;ll go further and faster if you have a robust knowledge of what&rsquo;s ahead. In this section, we&rsquo;ll look at some of the hazards on the map: the canyons and ridges along the fault lines of your organization, the weird political boundaries in places nobody would predict, and the difficult people everyone&rsquo;s been going out of their way to avoid. If there&rsquo;s quicksand ahead, or krakens to be wary of, or an impassable desert full of the sun-bleached skeletons of previous travelers, you&rsquo;ll want to mark those pretty clearly before you set out on your journey.</p>
<p>Despite the dangers and difficulties, you might find that there are navigable paths already in place. Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;personality&rdquo; and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; organization charts.</p>

<p>Clearing the Fog of War</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three maps already exist in your organization; they&rsquo;re just obscured. When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to clear some parts of the map through everyday learning, but you&rsquo;ll need to deliberately set out to clear other parts. A core theme of this chapter is how important it is to know things: to have continual context and a sense of what&rsquo;s going on. Knowing things takes both skill and opportunity, and you might need to work at it for a while before you start seeing what you&rsquo;re not seeing.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Why could they see all of these things when I couldn&rsquo;t? Because they had learned to pay attention and they knew what they were looking for.</p>
<p>Paying attention means being alert to facts that affect your projects or organization. And that means continually sifting information out of the noise around you. If you can train your brain to say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting!&rdquo; and remember facts that you might need later on, you&rsquo;ll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. What sorts of facts are useful? Anything that can help you or others have context for your work, navigate your organization, or progress toward your goals. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A company all-hands presentation about an upcoming marketing push might be a hint that huge traffic spikes you&rsquo;re not ready for are coming your way.</li>
<li>Your director asks you to take on a project you don&rsquo;t have time to do, but you know which senior engineers in your organization are ready for opportunities to stretch their skills.</li>
<li>A shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you&rsquo;d considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment.</li>
<li>Your database just disappeared, and you remember getting an email about network maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, you&rsquo;ll get used to how news travels in your org
and what you should pay attention to. [&hellip;] Think of
gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job.</p>

<h3 id="talking-with-your-child-when-a-loved-one-dies">Talking with your child when a loved one dies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be open to any questions your child may have, and try to answer your child&rsquo;s question as directly as you can. Know that your child may ask the same question over and over as they try to process and understand what is happening. If you are unsure of the answer or unsure of what to say, it is okay to say &ldquo;I wonder about that, too.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Use concrete words when you talk to your children. Use the word &ldquo;died,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;passed away&rdquo; or &ldquo;went to sleep&rdquo; to avoid confusion. Children of all ages may make up reasons for things they don&rsquo;t fully understand, and these reasons can be more upsetng than the truth.</li>
<li>You can talk to your child about what happens to a person&rsquo;s body when they die if they need help understanding. For example, you can let them know that when people die, they don&rsquo;t need to breathe anymore. Using the word &ldquo;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; helps your child to understand that the person does not need help and is not in pain or discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one thought that I feel can be helpful to grown-ups and children alike: Sadness isn&rsquo;t forever. I&rsquo;m not suggestng that we remind ourselves of this in order to lessen our grief. On the contrary. The knowledge that tme does bring relief from sadness and that sooner or later there will be days when we are happy again may allow us to grieve more fully and deeply when we need to.</p>
<p>Mister Rogers Talks with Parents</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-your-child-may-feel">What your child may feel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guilt</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>No reaction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-you-do-with-the-sad-that-you-feel">&ldquo;What can you do with the sad that you feel?&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the routines and expectations in your child&rsquo;s life consistent can help them feel safe and secure in the face of the changes that can come with a death.</li>
<li>Sharing memories and stories with your child about the person who has died may help them work through their grief. Art projects are one way you can connect over your memories of your loved one.</li>
<li>Children may engage in different forms of play after a difficult event like death. Young children may use imaginative play about death to process what is happening. This can be a normal coping mechanism and a way to communicate non-verbally. By watching your child play, you might see them act out any misunderstandings or confusion that they don&rsquo;t know how to talk about.</li>
<li>It may help to give children the opportunity to participate in the traditional events of a funeral or memorial service. This gives children time to work through the process of healing alongside family, friends, and community. Some ways children can participate in the funeral are by passing out programs, greeting people, lighting candles, or singing/playing music.</li>

<p>The knapsack problem is the following problem in combinatorial optimization:</p>
<p>Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.</p>
<p>It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<h3 id="0-1-knapsack-problem">0-1 knapsack problem</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common problem being solved is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number \(x_{i}\) of copies of each kind of item to zero or one. Given a set of \(n\) items numbered from 1 up to \(n\), each with a weight \(w_{i}\) and a value \(v_{i}\), along with a maximum weight capacity \(W\),</p>
<p>maximize \(\sum _{i=1}^{n}v_{i}x_{i}\)</p>
<p>subject to \(\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}\leq W\) and \(x_{i}\in \{0,1\}\)</p>
<p>Here \(x_i\) represents the number of instances of item \(i\) to include in the knapsack. Informally, the problem is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack&rsquo;s capacity.</p>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">“Knapsack Problem” 2023</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bounded-knapsack-problem">Bounded knapsack problem</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The bounded knapsack problem (BKP) removes the restriction that there is only one of each item, but restricts the number \(x_{i}\) of copies of each kind of item to a maximum non-negative integer value \(c\)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="unbounded-knapsack-problem">Unbounded knapsack problem</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The unbounded knapsack problem (UKP) places no upper bound on the number of copies of each kind of item and can be formulated as above except that the only restriction on \(x_{i}\) is that it is a non-negative integer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The subset sum problem [<a href="/posts/1590ca9a-06cb-4a3a-96c3-e52cbc31a0f3/">Subset sum problem</a>] is a special case of the decision and 0-1 problems where each kind of item, the weight equals the value: \(w_{i}=v_{i}\).</p>

<p>Dealing with degrees of smallness. That is, \(\frac{1}{100}\) as the first degree , \({\frac{1}{100}}^2 = \frac{1}{10,000}\) as the second degree, \({\frac{1}{100}}^3 = \frac{1}{1,000,000}\) as the third degree, and so on. The size of the nth-degree may be negligible such that we can safely ignore it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary size—a small creature of the first order of smallness. But he would probably not trouble himself about a flea&rsquo;s flea; being of the second order of smallness, it would be negligible. Even a gross of fleas' fleas would not be of much account to the ox.</p>

<p>Case 1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us begin with the simple expression \(y = x^2\) . Now remember that the fundamental notion about the calculus is the idea of growing. Mathematicians call it varying. Now as \(y\) and \(x^2\) are equal to one another, it is clear that if \(x\) grows, \(x^2\) will also grow. And if \(x^2\) grows, then \(y\) will also grow. What we have got to find out is the proportion between the growing of y and the growing of \(x\). In other words our task is to find out the ratio between \(dy\) and \(dx\), or, in brief, to find the value \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\begin{align}
y &amp;= x^2 \\
y + dy &amp;= (x + dx)^2 \\
y + dy &amp;= x^2 + 2x(dx) + (dx)^2 \\
y + dy &amp;= x^2 + 2x(dx) \\
x^2 + dy &amp;= x^2 + 2x(dx) \\
dy &amp;= 2x(dx) \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp;= 2x
\end{align}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<ul>
<li>4: &ldquo;What does (dx)2 mean? Remember that dx meant a bit—a little bit—of x. Then (dx)2 will mean a little bit of a little bit of x; that is, as explained above (p. 4), it is a small quantity of the second order of smallness. It may therefore be discarded as quite inconsiderable in comparison with the other terms.&rdquo;</li>
<li>5: \(y = x^2\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I could write the \(y = x^2\) as \(f(x) = x^2\) and use <a href="/posts/b92d8ad5-fe15-4a28-b9a7-0b8e9e1bcd13/">Lagrange&rsquo;s notation</a>: \(f'(x) = 2x\).</p>

<p>Branch and bound (BB, B&amp;B, or BnB) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.</p>
<p>The algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space. If no bounds are available, the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search.</p>

Taboo games are games which have good strategies which are dependent on ones opponents not knowing you&amp;rsquo;re playing the game. They&amp;rsquo;re usually social games we&amp;rsquo;re all already playing like status, likability, etc, where you&amp;rsquo;re punished if you call attention to the game itself. A losing strategy in gaining popularity is going around telling people directly that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to be more popular &amp;ndash; the game&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; say to punish people who call attention to the game.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Name is a work-in-progress.

<p>I thought of this phrasing while reading around <a href="/posts/8ecb934d-da88-40f4-851b-1fd5f2efd0ad/">Bryan Caplan | The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money</a>. It may be true that formal education has a lot of <a href="/posts/064e87e5-6a2d-480f-9cab-9ae1c1cc3ba4/">X isn&rsquo;t (only) about Y</a> going on. However, I don&rsquo;t think it could have scaled to its current size if everyone fully agreed with that position. While I recognize the political, social, career, etc, value of a college degree I also <em>like</em> the idea of a college degree based on the <a href="/posts/0a3904f5-1484-4c12-8abb-005c707401e1/">Signaling</a> &ndash; education, friends, learning how to think, challenging yourself and growing and changing, etc. I don&rsquo;t think an industry as large as that of education could work if everyone thought &ldquo;this is all <a href="/posts/0a3904f5-1484-4c12-8abb-005c707401e1/">Signaling</a>&rdquo; and yet carried on saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about the learning&rdquo;. People don&rsquo;t like <a href="/posts/097f418c-8af5-498a-a5e3-37bab614556e/">Cognitive dissonance</a>.</p>
<p>And that includes the students! Based on my own experience, students want to learn. Maybe not everything taught &ndash; we&rsquo;ll all gripe about the classes we have to take that we&rsquo;re not interested in &ndash; but a lot of it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About students who study the &ldquo;useless&rdquo; subjects like liberal arts mentioned is because, as anyone who has access to Google would know, those subjects get you consumption benefits (People like studying them), and they also get you access to jobs. Are students deluded about the purposes of their education? Not at all! They can honestly think that they study what they like, and that they also gain skills somewhat related to their future employment. A story like &ldquo;I like History so I study it, plus learning History will help me gain a broad understanding of human nature, writing, critical analysis, etc, and this is useful for management or whatever&rdquo; sounds like a plausible reason a History student would give.</p>

Summary Thoughts The general thrust that formal education is rife with Signaling and X isn&amp;rsquo;t (only) about Y-type cases rings true. However, I disagree with the degree; Yes, and. Education is about signaling and it&amp;rsquo;s about learning, and more. Truth resists simplicity. Viewing education through the Signaling lens is useful and correct but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only correct lens we can or should use.

<p>Robert Kegan&rsquo;s model of adult development has profoundly influenced my understanding of ethics, relationships, society, and thought. This page summarizes his theory.</p>
<p>Earlier, I&rsquo;ve mentioned Lawrence Kohlberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">related model</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) of moral development. He pointed out a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning. The capacity to reason in each of these ways develops over an individual&rsquo;s lifetime through a fixed sequence of developmental stages.</p>
<p>Kohlberg&rsquo;s model had strong empirical support, and it significantly advanced ethical understanding; but his approach was excessively rationalistic. Our moral being involves feeling and acting, just as much as reasoning. Moral activity is also always situated in richly textured social relationships and complex practicalities, and cannot be separated from them. Kohlberg&rsquo;s paradigm of ethics was sitting in an armchair, reasoning out the correct action in simple, imaginary cases that you have no personal connection with.</p>
<p>Kegan&rsquo;s model is, I believe, the most sophisticated and useful account of ethics available. It is not complete or conclusive. Like every conceptual scheme, it is not Ultimate Truth. It&rsquo;s a tool that&rsquo;s useful in many situations; inapplicable in many others; and misleading in some.</p>
<p>This summary of Kegan&rsquo;s work cannot be read as a casual blog post. It is better to approach it like a section of a textbook; you may need to read it slowly and carefully. The model is conceptually complex and difficult; to explain it properly takes a book. I hope some readers will find this summary makes sense, and that others will be motivated to read Kegan. His two relevant books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674272315/?tag=meaningness-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evolving Self</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674272315/?tag=meaningness-20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), which covers all the stages, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674445880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0674445880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meaningness-20&amp;linkId=AFL7YZE2CVEA7HQK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Over Our Heads</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674445880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0674445880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meaningness-20&amp;linkId=AFL7YZE2CVEA7HQK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), which is about the difficulty and importance of the stage 3 to 4 transition specifically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it makes sense. Take General Semantics (please!). I remember reading through Korzybski&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0937298018/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0937298018&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=6BN2XOJPPQ56YTXB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giant blue book of General Semantics</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0937298018/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0937298018&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=6BN2XOJPPQ56YTXB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), full of labyrinthine diagrams and promises that if only you understood this, you would engage with the world totally differently, you&rsquo;d be a new man armed with invincible cognitive weapons. And the key insight, maybe the <em>only</em> insight, was &ldquo;the map is not the territory&rdquo; [<a href="/posts/bfc5100c-d70d-4829-9798-7a90b5edea9b/">The map is not the territory</a>], which seems utterly banal.</p>
<p>But this is a self-environment distinction of exactly the sort that children learn in development. It&rsquo;s dividing your own representation of the world from the world itself; it&rsquo;s about as clear a reference to theory of mind as you could ask for. Korzybski considered it a revelation when he discovered it; thousands of other people found it helpful and started a movement around it; I conclude that these people were missing a piece of theory-of-mind and Korzybski gave it to them. Not the whole deal, of course. Just a piece. But a piece of something big and fundamental, so abstract and difficult to teach that it required that whole nine-hundred-something page book to cram it in.</p>

<p>I remember reading <a href="http://thenavelobservatory.com/2015/08/25/is-there-a-principled-distinction-between-refusing-to-watch-american-sniper-and-refusing-to-read-fun-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this piece</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://thenavelobservatory.com/2015/08/25/is-there-a-principled-distinction-between-refusing-to-watch-american-sniper-and-refusing-to-read-fun-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn&rsquo;t endorse war-violence-glorifying film &ldquo;American Sniper&rdquo; to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn&rsquo;t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book &ldquo;Fun Home&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>It is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn&rsquo;t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?</p>
</div>
<p>He proposes a bunch of potential counterarguments, then shoots each counterargument down by admitting that the other side would have a symmetrical counterargument of their own: for example, he believes that &ldquo;American Sniper&rdquo; is worse because it&rsquo;s racist and promoting racism is genuinely dangerous to a free society, but then he admits a conservative could say that &ldquo;Fun Home&rdquo; is worse because in their opinion it&rsquo;s homosexuality that&rsquo;s genuinely dangerous to a free society. After three or four levels of this, he ends up concluding that he can&rsquo;t come up with a meta-level fundamental difference, but he&rsquo;s going to fight for his values anyway because they&rsquo;re his. I&rsquo;m not sure what I think of this conclusion, but my main response to his article is <em>oh my gosh he gets the thing</em>, where &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; is a hard-to-describe ability to understand that other people are going to go down as many levels to defend their self-consistent values as you will to defend yours. It seems silly when I&rsquo;m saying it like this, and you should probably just read the article, but I&rsquo;ve seen <em>so many people</em> who lack this basic mental operation that this immediately endeared him to me. I would argue Nathan Robinson has a piece of theory-of-mind that a lot of other people are missing.</p>
<p>Actually, I was kind of also thinking this with his <a href="http://thenavelobservatory.com/2015/10/31/how-do-you-get-away-with-writing-something-like-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent post</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/http://thenavelobservatory.com/2015/10/31/how-do-you-get-away-with-writing-something-like-this/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), which complains about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/27/the-insiders-the-fbi-director-is-saying-something-the-democrats-need-to-hear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Washington Post article</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2023*/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/10/27/the-insiders-the-fbi-director-is-saying-something-the-democrats-need-to-hear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>). The Post argues that because the Democrats support gun control and protest police, they are becoming the &ldquo;pro-crime party&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure whether the Post genuinely believes the Democrats are pro-crime by inclination or are just arguing their policies will lead to more crime in a hyperbolic figurative way, but I&rsquo;ve certainly seen sources further right make the &ldquo;genuinely in favor of crime as a terminal value&rdquo; argument. And this doesn&rsquo;t seem too different from the leftist sources that say Republicans can&rsquo;t <em>really</em> care about the lives of the unborn, they&rsquo;re just &ldquo;anti-woman&rdquo; as a terminal value. Both proposals share this idea of not being able to understand that other people have different beliefs than you and that their actions proceed naturally from those beliefs. Instead of saying &ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,&rdquo; they say &ldquo;I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.&rdquo; [related: <a href="/posts/c0564758-b90d-42a6-be58-44d8985330ad/">Ian Danskin | Always a Bigger Fish</a>]</p>

<h3 id="i">I</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scott starts with the story of &ldquo;scientific forestry&rdquo; in 18th century Prussia. Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, like a chump. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.</p>
<p>This went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn&rsquo;t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and &ldquo;scientific forestry&rdquo; spread across Europe and the world.</p>
<p>And this pattern repeats with suspicious regularity across history, not just in biological systems but also in social ones.</p>
<p>Natural organically-evolved cities tend to be densely-packed mixtures of dark alleys, tiny shops, and overcrowded streets. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of identical giant Brutalist apartment buildings separated by wide boulevards, with everything separated into carefully-zoned districts. Yet for some reason, whenever these new rational cities were built, people hated them and did everything they could to move out into more organic suburbs. And again, for some reason the urban planners got promoted, became famous, and spread their destructive techniques around the world.</p>
<p>Ye olde organically-evolved peasant villages tended to be complicated confusions of everybody trying to raise fifty different crops at the same time on awkwardly shaped cramped parcels of land. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: giant collective mechanized farms growing purpose-bred high-yield crops and arranged in (say it with me) evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these giant collective farms had lower yields per acre than the old traditional methods, and wherever they arose famine and mass starvation followed. And again, for some reason governments continued to push the more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; methods, whether it was socialist collectives in the USSR, big agricultural corporations in the US, or sprawling banana plantations in the Third World.</p>
<p>Traditional lifestyles of many East African natives were nomadic, involving slash-and-burn agriculture in complicated jungle terrain according to a bewildering variety of ad-hoc rules. Modern scientific rationalists in African governments (both colonial and independent) came up with a better idea – resettlement of the natives into villages, where they could have modern amenities like schools, wells, electricity, and evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these villages kept failing: their crops died, their economies collapsed, and their native inhabitants disappeared back into the jungle. And again, for some reason the African governments kept trying to bring the natives back and make them stay, even if they had to blur the lines between villages and concentration camps to make it work.</p>
<p>Why did all of these schemes fail? And more importantly, why were they celebrated, rewarded, and continued, even when the fact of their failure became too obvious to ignore? Scott gives a two part answer.</p>
<p>The first part of the story is High Modernism [<a href="/posts/94f5d6dd-a97a-45af-be05-4e7096dea51a/">High modernism</a>], an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific philosophy. The High Modernists claimed to be about figuring out the most efficient and high-tech way of doing things, but most of them knew little relevant math or science and were basically just LARPing being rational by placing things in evenly-spaced rectangular grids.</p>
<p>But the High Modernists were pawns in service of a deeper motive: the centralized state wanted the world to be &ldquo;legible&rdquo; [<a href="/posts/20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0/">Legible</a>], ie arranged in a way that made it easy to monitor and control. An intact forest might be more productive than an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of Norway spruce, but it was harder to legislate rules for, or assess taxes on.</p>
<p>The state promoted the High Modernists' platitudes about The Greater Good as cover [<a href="/posts/064e87e5-6a2d-480f-9cab-9ae1c1cc3ba4/">X isn&rsquo;t (only) about Y</a>], in order to implement the totalitarian schemes they wanted to implement anyway. The resulting experiments were usually failures by the humanitarian goals of the Modernists, but resounding successes by the command-and-control goals of the state. And so we gradually transitioned from systems that were messy but full of fine-tuned hidden order, to ones that were barely-functional but really easy to tax.</p>

<p>Examples and quotes from (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Scott 2020</a>) illustrating the difficulty of ruling/administering a population which lacks certain shared standards (e.g. weights, measures, definitions of what is &ldquo;taxable land&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id="iii">III</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The moral of the story is: premodern states had very limited ability to tax their citizens effectively. Along with the problems mentioned above – nonstandardized measurement, nonstandardized property rights, nonstandardized personal names – we can add a few others. At this point national languages were a cruel fiction; local &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; could be as different from one another as eg Spanish is from Portuguese, so villagers might not even be able to understand the tax collectors. Worst of all, there was no such thing as a census in France until the 17th century, so there wasn&rsquo;t even a good idea of how many people or villages there were.</p>
<p>Kings usually solved this problem by leaving the tax collection up to local lords, who presumably knew the idiosyncracies of their own domains. But one step wasn&rsquo;t always enough. If the King only knew Dukes, and the Dukes only knew Barons, and the Barons only knew village headmen, and it was only the village headmen who actually knew anything about the peasants, then you needed a four-step chain to get any taxes. Each link in the chain had an incentive to collect as much as they could and give up as little as they could get away with. So on the one end, the peasants were paying backbreaking punitive taxes. And on the other, the Royal Treasurer was handing the King half a loaf of moldy bread and saying &ldquo;Here you go, Sire, apparently this is all the grain in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So from the beginning, kings had an incentive to make the country &ldquo;legible&rdquo; – that is, so organized and well-indexed that it was easy to know everything about everyone and collect/double-check taxes. Also from the beginning, nobles had an incentive to frustrate the kings so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be out of a job. And commoners, who figured that anything which made it easier for the State to tax them and interfere in their affairs was bad news, usually resisted too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the early modern period is defined by an uneasy truce between states who want to be able to count and standardize everything, and citizens who don&rsquo;t want to let them. Enter High Modernism [<a href="/posts/94f5d6dd-a97a-45af-be05-4e7096dea51a/">High modernism</a>].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scott uses Le Corbusier as the epitome of five High Modernist principles.</p>
<ol>
<li>[T]here can be no compromise with the existing infrastructure. It was designed by superstitious people who didn&rsquo;t have architecture degrees, or at the very least got their architecture degrees in the past and so were insufficiently Modern. The more completely it is bulldozed to make way for the Glorious Future, the better.</li>
<li>[H]uman needs can be abstracted and calculated. A human needs X amount of food. A human needs X amount of water. A human needs X amount of light, and prefers to travel at X speed, and wants to live within X miles of the workplace. These needs are easily calculable by experiment, and a good city is the one built to satisfy these needs and ignore any competing frivolities.</li>
<li>[T]he solution is the solution. It is universal. The rational design for Moscow is the same as the rational design for Paris is the same as the rational design for Chandigarh, India. As a corollary, all of these cities ought to look exactly the same. It is maybe permissible to adjust for obstacles like mountains or lakes. But only if you are on too short a budget to follow the rationally correct solution of leveling the mountain and draining the lake to make your city truly optimal.</li>
<li>[A]ll of the relevant rules should be explicitly determined by technocrats, then followed to the letter by their subordinates. Following these rules is better than trying to use your intuition, in the same way that using the laws of physics to calculate the heat from burning something is better than just trying to guess, or following an evidence-based clinical algorithm is better than just prescribing whatever you feel like.</li>
<li>[T]here is nothing whatsoever to be gained or learned from the people involved (eg the city&rsquo;s future citizens). You are a rational modern scientist with an architecture degree who has already calculated out the precise value for all relevant urban parameters. They are yokels who probably cannot even spell the word architecture, let alone usefully contribute to it. They probably make all of their decisions based on superstition or tradition or something, and their input should be ignored For Their Own Good.</li>

<p>What happened? Scott writes:</p>
<div class="quote2">
<p>Most of those who have moved to Brasilia from other cities are amazed to discover &ldquo;that it is a city without crowds.&rdquo; People complain that Brasilia lacks the bustle of street life, that it has none of the busy street corners and long stretches of storefront facades that animate a sidewalk for pedestrians. For them, it is almost as if the founders of Brasilia, rather than having planned a city, have actually planned to prevent a city. The most common way they put it is to say that Brasilia &ldquo;lacks street corners,&ldquo;by which they mean that it lacks the complex intersections of dense neighborhoods comprising residences and public cafes and restaurants with places for leisure, work, and shopping.</p>
<p>While Brasilia provides well for some human needs, the functional separation of work from residence and of both from commerce and entertainment, the great voids between superquadra, and a road system devoted exclusively to motorized traffic make the disappearance of the street corner a foregone conclusion. The plan did eliminate traffic jams; it also eliminated the welcome and familiar pedestrian jams that one of Holston&rsquo;s informants called &ldquo;the point of social conviviality</p>
<p>The term brasilite, meaning roughly Brasilia-itis,which was coined by the first-generation residents, nicely captures the trauma they experienced. As a mock clinical condition, it connotes a rejection of the standardization and anonymity of life in Brasilia. &ldquo;They use the term brasilite to refer to their feelings about a daily life without the pleasures-the distractions, conversations, flirtations, and little rituals of outdoor life in other Brazilian cities.&rdquo; Meeting someone normally requires seeing them either at their apartment [<a href="/posts/4c7744c9-e283-4a74-9b2f-40f39c6d262e/">First place</a>] or at work [<a href="/posts/734b5d37-a342-4dbe-9e6a-e63df297433a/">Second place</a>]. Even if we allow for the initial simplifying premise of Brasilia&rsquo;s being an administrative city, there is nonetheless a bland anonymity built into the very structure of the capital. The population simply lacks the small accessible spaces that they could colonize and stamp with the character of their activity, as they have done historically in Rio and Sao Paulo. To be sure, the inhabitants of Brasilia haven&rsquo;t had much time to modify the city through their practices, but the city is designed to be fairly recalcitrant to their efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brasilite,&rdquo; as a term, also underscores how the built environment affects those who dwell in it. Compared to life in Rio and Sao Paulo, with their color and variety, the daily round in bland, repetitive, austere Brasilia must have resembled life in a sensory deprivation tank. The recipe for high-modernist urban planning, while it may have created formal order and functional segregation, did so at the cost of a sensorily impoverished and monotonous environment-an environment that inevitably took its toll on the spirits of its residents.</p>
<p>The anonymity induced by Brasilia is evident from the scale and exterior of the apartments that typically make up each residential superquadra. For superquadra residents, the two most frequent complaints are the sameness of the apartment blocks and the isolation of the residences (&ldquo;In Brasilia, there is only house and work&rdquo;). The facade of each block is strictly geometric and egalitarian. Nothing distinguishes the exterior of one apartment from another; there are not even balconies that would allow residents to add distinctive touches and create semipublic spaces.</p>
</div>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>I never really &ldquo;got&rdquo; Jane Jacobs. I originally interpreted her as arguing that it was great for cities to be noisy and busy and full of crowds, and that we should build neighborhoods that are confusing and hard to get through to force people to interact with each other and prevent them from being able to have privacy, and no one should be allowed to live anywhere quiet or nice. As somebody who (thanks to the public school system, etc) has had my share of being forced to interact with people, and of being placed in situations where it is deliberately difficult to have any privacy or time to myself, I figured Jane Jacobs was just a jerk.</p>
<p>But Scott has kind of made me come around. He rehabilitates her as someone who was responding to the very real excesses of High Modernism. She was the first person who really said &ldquo;Hey, maybe people like being in cute little neighborhoods&rdquo;. Her complaint wasn&rsquo;t really against privacy or order per se as it was against extreme High Modernist perversions of those concepts that people empirically hated. And her background makes this all too understandable – she started out as a journalist covering poor African-Americans who lived in the projects and had some of the same complaints as Brazilians.</p>
<p>Her critique of Le Corbusierism was mostly what you would expect, but Scott extracts some points useful for their contrast with the Modernist points earlier:</p>
<ol>
<li>[E]xisting structures are evolved organisms built by people trying to satisfy their social goals. They contain far more wisdom about people&rsquo;s needs and desires than anybody could formally enumerate. Any attempt at urban planning should try to build on this encoded knowledge, not detract from it.</li>
<li>[M]an does not live by bread alone. People don&rsquo;t want the right amount of Standardized Food Product, they want social interaction, culture, art, coziness, and a host of other things nobody will ever be able to calculate. Existing structures have already been optimized for these things, and unless you&rsquo;re really sure you understand all of them, you should be reluctant to disturb them [<a href="/posts/975b8bf2-d4cb-4a1d-a976-0f6d0130dbc5/">Chesterton&rsquo;s fence</a>].</li>
<li>[S]olutions are local. Americans want different things than Africans or Indians. One proof of this is that New York looks different from Lagos and from Delhi. Even if you are the world&rsquo;s best American city planner, you should be very concerned that you have no idea what people in Africa need, and you should be very reluctant to design an African city without extensive consultation of people who understand the local environment.</li>
<li>[E]ven a very smart and well-intentioned person who is on board with points 1-3 will never be able to produce a set of rules. Most of people&rsquo;s knowledge is implicit [<a href="/posts/d636dfa7-428d-457c-8db6-15fa61e03bef/">Implicit knowledge</a>], and most rule codes are quickly replaced by informal systems [<a href="/posts/d636dfa7-428d-457c-8db6-15fa61e03bef/">Tacit knowledge</a>] of things that work which are much more effective (the classic example of this is work-to-rule [<a href="/posts/83d72898-e7df-48d7-9cbc-6c0f99096b2f/">Work-to-rule</a>] strikes).</li>
<li>[A]lthough well-educated technocrats may understand principles which give them some advantages in their domain, they are hopeless without the on-the-ground experience of the people they are trying to serve, whose years of living in their environment and dealing with it every day have given them a deep practical knowledge which is difficult to codify.</li>

<p>Even in less exotic locales like Russia, the peasant farmers were extraordinary experts on the conditions of their own farms, their own climates, and their own crops.

<p>Historically, the relative illegibility to outsiders of some urban neighborhoods has provided a vital margin of political safety from control by outside elites. A simple way of determining whether this margin exists is to ask if an outsider would have needed a local guide in order to find her way successfully. If the answer is yes, then the community or terrain in question enjoys at least a small measure of insulation from outside intrusion. Coupled with patterns of local solidarity, this insulation has proven politically valuable in such disparate contexts as eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century urban riots over bread prices in Europe, the Front de Liberation Nationale&rsquo;s tenacious resistance to the French in the Casbah of Algiers, and the politics of the bazaar that helped to bring down the Shah of Iran. Illegibility, then, has been and remains a reliable resource for political autonomy</p>

<p>This was a particular problem in Paris, which was famous for a series of urban insurrections in the 19th century (think Les Miserables, but about once every ten years or so). Although these generally failed, they were hard to suppress because locals knew the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; and the streets were narrow enough to barricade. Slums full of poor people gathered together formed tight communities where revolutionary ideas could easily spread. The late 19th-century redesign of Paris had the explicit design of destroying these areas and splitting up poor people somewhere far away from the city center where they couldn&rsquo;t do any harm.</p>

<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>So although modernist cities and farms may have started out as attempts to help citizens with living and farming, they ended up as contributors to the great government project of legibility and taxing people effectively.</p>
<p><em>Seeing Like A State</em> summarizes the sort of on-the-ground ultra-empirical knowledge that citizens have of city design and peasants of farming as <em>metis</em>, a Greek term meaning &ldquo;practical wisdom&rdquo;. I was a little concerned about this because they seem like two different things. The average citizen knows nothing about city design and in fact does not design cities; cities sort of happen in a weird way through cultural evolution or whatever. The average farmer knows a lot about farming (even if it is implicit and not as book learning) and applies that knowledge directly in how they farm. But Scott thinks these are more or less the same thing, that this thing is a foundation of successful communities and industries, and that ignoring and suppressing it is what makes collective farms and modernist planned cities so crappy. He generalizes this further to almost every aspect of a society &ndash; its language, laws, social norms, and economy. But this is all done very quickly, and I feel like there was a sleight of hand between &ldquo;each farmer eventually figures out how to farm well&rdquo; and &ldquo;social norms converge on good values&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Insofar as Scott squares the above circle, he seems to think that many actors competing with each other will eventually carve out a beneficial equilibrium better than that of any centralized authority. This doesn&rsquo;t really mesh will with <a href="/posts/1bba449a-48eb-479a-be4d-a4d7f8095b6a/">my own fear</a> that many actors competing with each other will eventually shoot themselves in the foot and destroy everything, and I haven&rsquo;t really seen a careful investigation of when we get one versus the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="vii">VII</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What are we to make of all of this?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, Scott basically admits to stacking the dice against High Modernism and legibility. He admits that the organic livable cities of old had life expectancies in the forties because nobody got any light or fresh air and they were all packed together with no sewers and so everyone just died of cholera. He admits that at some point agricultural productivity multiplied by like a thousand times and the Green Revolution saved millions of lives and all that, and probably that has something to do with scientific farming methods and rectangular grids. He admits that it&rsquo;s pretty convenient having a unit of measurement that local lords can&rsquo;t change whenever they feel like it. Even modern timber farms seem pretty successful. After all those admissions, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to see what&rsquo;s left of his case.</p>
<p>(also, I grew up in Irvine, the most planned of planned cities, and I loved it.)</p>
<p>What Scott eventually says is that he&rsquo;s not against legibility and modernism per se, but he wants to present them as ingredients in a cocktail of state failure. You need a combination of four things to get a disaster like Soviet collective farming (or his other favorite example, compulsory village settlement in Tanzania). First, a government incentivized to seek greater legibility for its population and territory. Second, a High Modernist ideology. Third, authoritarianism. And fourth, a &ldquo;prostrate civil society&rdquo;, like in Russia after the Revolution, or in colonies after the Europeans took over.</p>
<p>I think his theory is that the back-and-forth between centralized government and civil society allows scientific advances to be implemented smoothly instead of just plowing over everyone in a way that leads to disaster. I also think that maybe a big part of it is incremental versus sudden: western farming did well because it got to incrementally add advances and see how they worked, but when you threw the entire edifice at Tanzania it crashed and burned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not really sure what&rsquo;s left. Authoritarianism is bad? Destroying civil society is bad? You shouldn&rsquo;t do things when you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing and all you&rsquo;ve got to go on is your rectangle fetish? The book contained some great historical tidbits, but I&rsquo;m not sure what overarching lesson I learned from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t think Scott&rsquo;s preference for metis over scientific omnipotence has value. I think it has lots of value. I see this all the time in psychiatry, which always has been and to some degree still is really High Modernist. We are educated people who know a lot about mental health, dealing with a poor population who (in the case of one of my patients) refers to Haldol as &ldquo;Hound Dog&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s very easy to get in the trap of thinking that you know better than these people, especially since you often do (I will never understand how many people are shocked when I diagnose their sleep disorder as having something to do with them drinking fifteen cups of coffee a day).</p>
<p>But psychiatric patients have a metis of dealing with their individual diseases the same way peasants have a metis of dealing with their individual plots of land. My favorite example of this is doctors who learn their patients are taking marijuana, refuse to keep prescribing them their vitally important drugs unless the patient promises to stop, and then gets surprised when the patients end up decompensating because the marijuana was keeping them together. I&rsquo;m not saying smoking marijuana is a good thing. I&rsquo;m saying that for some people it&rsquo;s a load-bearing piece of their mental edifice. And if you take it away without any replacement they will fall apart. And they have explained this to you a thousand times and you didn&rsquo;t believe them.</p>
<p>There are so many fricking patients who respond to sedative medications by becoming stimulated, or stimulant medications by becoming sedated, or who become more anxious whenever they do anti-anxiety exercises, or who hallucinate when placed on some super common medication that has never caused hallucinations in anyone else, or who become suicidal if you try to reassure them that things aren&rsquo;t so bad, or any other completely perverse and ridiculous violation of the natural order that you can think of. And the only redeeming feature of all of this is that the patients themselves know all of this stuff super-well and are usually happy to tell you if you ask.</p>
<p>I can totally imagine going into a psychiatric clinic armed with the Evidence-Based Guidelines the same way Le Corbusier went into Moscow and Paris armed with his Single Rational City Plan and the same way the agricultural scientists went into Tanzania armed with their List Of Things That Definitely Work In Europe. I expect it would have about the same effect for about the same reason.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>So fine, Scott is completely right here. But I&rsquo;m only bringing this up because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve already thought about. If I didn&rsquo;t already believe this, I&rsquo;d be indifferent between applying the narrative of the wise Tanzanian farmers knowing more than their English colonizers, versus the narrative of the dumb yokels who refuse to get vaccines because they might cause autism. Heuristics work until they don&rsquo;t. Scott provides us with these great historical examples of local knowledge outdoing scientific acumen, but other stories present us with great historical examples of the opposite, and when to apply which heuristic seems really unclear. Even &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bulldoze civil society and try to change everything at once&rdquo; goes astray sometimes; the Meiji Restoration was wildly successful by doing exactly that.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ol>
<li>A list of \(n\) vectors, \(\vec{x}_1 \dots \vec{x}_n\)</li>
<li>An initial list of \(k\) group representative vectors, \(\vec{z}_i \dots \vec{z}_k\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Where:</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\vec{c}\) encodes cluster membership</li>
<li>\(\vec{c}_i\) indicates the cluster to which \(\vec{x}_i\) belongs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initialize the centroids</p>
<p>\(\vec{\mu}_i \dots \vec{\mu}_k\)</p>
<p>Repeat until convergence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partition the vectors into \(k\) groups*</p>
<p>For each vector, assign \(\vec{x}_i\) to the group associated with the nearest representative.\(\vec{c}_i := \underset{j}{\operatorname{argmin} } \| \vec{x}_i - \vec{\mu}_j \|^2\) for \(i = 1 \dots n\), \(j = 1 \dots k\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update representatives*</p>
<p>For each group, set \(\vec{z}_i\) to be the mean of the vectors in the $i$th group.\(\vec{\mu}_j := \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1\{\vec{c}_i = j\}\vec{x}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1\{\vec{c}_i = j\} }\) for \(j = 1 \dots k\)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the greatest things about working with clay is the simple fact that any scraps you end up with throughout the making process can easily just be recycled and reused and eventually thrown into new pots. This recyclable waste can come from numerous places the most prevalent being from the trimming process where layers of leather hard clay are trimmed away from the pots that fill up the wheel tray with thin coils of clay. As they&rsquo;re so thin, and disintegrate really easily, I immediately just chuck them into the reclaim bucket that lives next to my wheel and anytime my tray gets full I simply just dump them straight into it. Anything thicker than these turnings say a larger chunk of leather hard clay &ndash; I&rsquo;ll never throw that directly into the reclaimed bucket if it&rsquo;s still slightly wet as it&rsquo;ll take weeks to degrade to a point where it can be recycled nicely so, instead, I&rsquo;ll let it turn completely bone dry before placing it into this bucket. I also add things like the slops left over from my throwing water and when all these trimmings and other bits of waste are soaked overnight it&rsquo;ll slake down into a fine slurry.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m throwing pots if I need to remove the slip off my hands I do so against this sharp edge of a bucket filled with water. Then at the end of the day once I&rsquo;ve finished throwing all my pots I&rsquo;ll sponge down the wheel and then I&rsquo;ll clean all of my tools and I&rsquo;ll ring out the sponge in that same bucket of water. Even though I have a clay trap under the sink in my studio I still wash all of my tools and sponges and towels and things in this bucket of water first. I also don&rsquo;t necessarily worry about cleaning every tool perfectly as, under normal circumstances, I&rsquo;m probably going to use them in the next few days. I&rsquo;ll lay out all of these wash tools on a cloth to dry overnight and at the same time all the clay will settle in a layer at the bottom.</p>
<p>The following morning I then carefully pour away the water trying my very best not to disturb the settled clay in the bottom. I swirl together what&rsquo;s left and then this once again is added to my reclaim bucket.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Again after a week or maybe two of throwing and trimming the bucket usually gets full. I then use a large sponge to remove as much excess water from the top as possible &ndash; which I ring out in my other bucket of water that will eventually get added back to this. I then drag the bucket over to my plaster bats (which are made from a mixture of 80 potters plaster and 20 casting plaster, for strength). I place these plaster bats onto three kiln props so air can get beneath them and help dry them out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heavy thick bats that&rsquo;ll absorb a lot of water from the clay that&rsquo;s placed onto it, yet, they can still quickly become saturated and from time to time when they&rsquo;re not in use I&rsquo;ll either take them outside to sit in the sun or I&rsquo;ll place them underneath my gas kiln when I&rsquo;m firing it. I used to prop them up with wooden slats but they quickly become very moldy whereas these kiln props can&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re also given a scrub clean every now and then to dislodge any loose plaster that might find its way into your clay body which you definitely want to try and avoid as small specks of plaster lodged in clay once fired can cause the clay and glaze above it to shear off, which is something potters called lime popping [<a href="/posts/fdb8621b-64af-4d22-a7e6-e83c0a2dd2fa/">Lime popping</a>], so if you do recycle your clay like this and you find a little hard bead of white in your clay it&rsquo;s best to remove it.</p>

Mastery learning (or, as it was initially called, &amp;ldquo;learning for mastery&amp;rdquo;; also known as &amp;ldquo;mastery-based learning&amp;rdquo;) is an instructional strategy and educational philosophy, first formally proposed by Benjamin Bloom [Benjamin Bloom] in 1968.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Mastery learning (or, as it was initially called, &ldquo;learning for mastery&rdquo;; also known as &ldquo;mastery-based learning&rdquo;) is an instructional strategy and educational philosophy, first formally proposed by Benjamin Bloom [<a href="/posts/d449ac76-f230-4922-ab7c-3b65c90a4ea9/">Benjamin Bloom</a>] in 1968. Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.</p>
<p>Mastery learning methods suggest that the focus of instruction should be the time required for different students to learn the same material and achieve the same level of mastery. This is very much in contrast with classic models of teaching that focus more on differences in students' ability and where all students are given approximately the same amount of time to learn and the same set of instructions.</p>
<p>In mastery learning, there is a shift in responsibilities, so that the students' failure is considered to be more due to the instruction and not necessarily their lack of ability. This also means teachers' attention to individual students is emphasised as opposed to assessing group performance. Therefore, in a mastery learning environment, the challenge becomes providing enough time and employing instructional strategies so that all students can achieve the same level of learning.</p>
<p>Since its conception, mastery learning has empirically been demonstrated to be effective in improving education outcomes in a variety of settings. Its effectiveness is influenced by the subject being taught, whether testing is designed locally or nationally, course pace and the amount of feedback provided to students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon&rsquo;s graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &ldquo;Morning, boys. How&rsquo;s the water?&rdquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &ldquo;What the hell is water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you&rsquo;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don&rsquo;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.</p>
<p>Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I&rsquo;m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education&rsquo;s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let&rsquo;s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about &ldquo;teaching you how to think.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re like me as a student, you&rsquo;ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I&rsquo;m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we&rsquo;re supposed to get in a place like this isn&rsquo;t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I&rsquo;d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It&rsquo;s not like I haven&rsquo;t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn&rsquo;t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out &lsquo;Oh, God, if there is a God, I&rsquo;m lost in this blizzard, and I&rsquo;m gonna die if you don&rsquo;t help me.'&rdquo; And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. &ldquo;Well then you must believe now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;After all, here you are, alive.&rdquo; The atheist just rolls his eyes. &ldquo;No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people&rsquo;s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy&rsquo;s interpretation is true and the other guy&rsquo;s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person&rsquo;s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there&rsquo;s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They&rsquo;re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists&rsquo; problem is exactly the same as the story&rsquo;s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn&rsquo;t even know he&rsquo;s locked up.</p>
<p>The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.</p>
<p>Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it&rsquo;s so socially repulsive. But it&rsquo;s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t worry that I&rsquo;m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It&rsquo;s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being &ldquo;well-adjusted&rdquo;, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.</p>
<p>Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education–least in my own case–is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about &ldquo;the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.</p>
<p>And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let&rsquo;s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what &ldquo;day in day out&rdquo; really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>By way of example, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you&rsquo;re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there&rsquo;s no food at home. You haven&rsquo;t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It&rsquo;s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it&rsquo;s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it&rsquo;s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can&rsquo;t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store&rsquo;s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren&rsquo;t enough check-out lanes open even though it&rsquo;s the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can&rsquo;t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.</p>
<p>But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line&rsquo;s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to &ldquo;Have a nice day&rdquo; in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.</p>
<p>Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn&rsquo;t yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year.</p>
<p>But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don&rsquo;t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I&rsquo;m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it&rsquo;s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.</p>
<p>Or, of course, if I&rsquo;m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV&rsquo;s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] — this is an example of how NOT to think, though — most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children&rsquo;s children will despise us for wasting all the future&rsquo;s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It&rsquo;s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I&rsquo;m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it&rsquo;s not impossible that some of these people in SUV&rsquo;s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he&rsquo;s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he&rsquo;s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.</p>
<p>Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket&rsquo;s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.</p>
<p>Again, please don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m giving you moral advice, or that I&rsquo;m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it&rsquo;s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won&rsquo;t be able to do it, or you just flat out won&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>But most days, if you&rsquo;re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she&rsquo;s not usually like this. Maybe she&rsquo;s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it&rsquo;s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you&rsquo;re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won&rsquo;t consider possibilities that aren&rsquo;t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.</p>
<p>Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that&rsquo;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you&rsquo;re gonna try to see it.</p>
<p>This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn&rsquo;t. You get to decide what to worship.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&rsquo;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&rsquo;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.</p>
<p>Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they&rsquo;re evil or sinful, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re unconscious. They are default settings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving…. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.</p>
<p>That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.</p>
<p>I know that this stuff probably doesn&rsquo;t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don&rsquo;t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.</p>
<p>The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.</p>
<p>It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.</p>
<p>I wish you way more than luck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vertical integration can be an effective way of resolving the intractable market dispute with top-down dictatorships, but can require lax anti-monopoly regulations, high capital investment, massive corporation overextension &amp; empire-building, and risks being outcompeted at every level by nimbler competitors; this makes it difficult for any up-and-coming company to implement, and often ineffective. Commoditizing the complements, in contrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small &amp; lean, can often be accomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual property or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific layers without the &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; orientation of vertical integration and permitting &ldquo;defeat in detail&rdquo;, retains the general facade of competition, and ensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack where the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but is not itself at any risk.</p>
<p>In practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market dynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging competitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits &amp; software patent trolling, proprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate incompatibility or &ldquo;embrace and extend&rdquo;, FUD, operating at a loss indefinitely, etc. (&ldquo;There&rsquo;s An App For That&rdquo; is why you buy an iPhone—but it&rsquo;s Apple with the $930 billion market cap &amp; not the app developers.)</p>
<p>Done correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents' long-term control of markets &amp; justifies their enormous valuations—by definition, the competitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too numerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening R&amp;D4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be relatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor does this require convoluted explanations like &ldquo;they are pretending to not be monopolists&rdquo; or fully general unfalsifiable claims like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good PR&rdquo; for why big companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects like new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts &amp; TrueType itself) or open source TCP/​IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly profitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable—but do have clear explanations in terms of business objectives like &ldquo;driving more mobile web browsing&rdquo; (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement, mobile web browsing, has become cheaper/​easier). I wonder if this also explains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes—as entities get worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but was formerly considered &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; or because they assume the other entity knows something they don&rsquo;t. (Google cared little about an also-ran code-hosting site like GitLab other than some VC investment—well, right up until Microsoft outbid it for Github &amp; Github became free for individual developers &amp; acquired NPM⁠, and then suddenly GitLab becomes a unicorn with even more VC from Google &amp; others.)</p>

<p>Let me tell you what is, in my opinion, the central problem of human existence: I am stuck in my body, in my consciousness, seeing out of my eyes. I am the only me I ever get to be, and so I am the only person I can imagine endlessly complexly. That&rsquo;s not the problem, actually. The problem is you. You are so busy taking in your own wondrousness that you can&rsquo;t be bothered to acknowledge mine.</p>

Summary Thoughts Notes Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.
A mental model is simply a representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/3c2ba4ec-1daa-4ea4-a4fb-641493b4ac91/">Farnam Street</a>, (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Farnum Street n.d.</a>)</p>

<p>Who built the seven gates of Thebes?<br />
The books are filled with names of kings.<br />
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?<br />
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.<br />
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima&rsquo;s houses,<br />
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?<br />
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished<br />
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome<br />
Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom<br />
Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.<br />
Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend<br />
The night the seas rushed in,<br />
The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.<br />
<br />
Young Alexander conquered India.<br />
He alone?<br />
Caesar beat the Gauls.<br />
Was there not even a cook in his army?<br />
Phillip of Spain wept as his fleet<br />
was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears?<br />
Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years War.<br />
Who triumphed with him?<br />
<br />
Each page a victory<br />
At whose expense the victory ball?<br />
Every ten years a great man,<br />
Who paid the piper?<br />
<br />
So many particulars.<br />
So many questions.<br /></p>

<p>To find the definition by encircling it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change X to match your audience&rsquo;s expectations
<ul>
<li>Language
<ul>
<li>Drop key words/phrases in interviews. Your interviewer is looking for someone who can do the job well and they&rsquo;ll likely be listening for particular phrases and keywords which they expect to hear from someone who can do the job well.</li>
<li>Code-switching</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Code interviews
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;re looking to hire someone &ldquo;good&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re using &ldquo;can answer this computer-science question&rdquo; as a proxy. It&rsquo;s in your interest to be good at that proxy.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>All of this is useful to reduce the friction between you and the other person. You aren&rsquo;t being your authentic self. However, that&rsquo;s not always the goal. I don&rsquo;t want to be my full authentic self with everybody I meet. Some interactions are transactional.</p>

Of course, we&rsquo;ll iterate on their contents over time, but each time we do, that note will remain a mostly-complete, self-contained unit.</p>
<p>By contrast, when we&rsquo;re working on a large work-in-progress manuscript, we&rsquo;re juggling many ideas in various states of completion. Different parts of the document are at different levels of fidelity. The document is large enough that it&rsquo;s easy to lose one&rsquo;s place or to forget where other relevant points are when one returns. Starting and stopping work for the day feel like heavy tasks, drawing heavily on working memory.</p>

<p>In mathematics, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object&rsquo;s velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the &ldquo;instantaneous rate of change&rdquo;, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation [<a href="/posts/d5355c3a-2137-46b2-af5a-10f9c3a6705f/">Differentiation</a>]. The reverse process is called antidifferentiation [<a href="/posts/4dafe179-aeb8-4718-9eb8-ac96a27f9a58/">Antiderivative</a>]. The fundamental theorem of calculus [<a href="/posts/adda1031-550c-4f65-9384-1ee018532adc/">Fundamental theorem of calculus</a>] relates antidifferentiation with integration [<a href="/posts/61de6a28-e681-45bd-a086-fff5b924354e/">Integration</a>]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.</p>

<p>\(f'(x)\) is the slope of the tangent line of \(f(x)\).</p>
<h2 id="finding-maxima-and-minima--maxima-and-minima-dot-md--with-differentiation">Finding <a href="/posts/c2ad13d0-6556-40ff-b19a-5b2eeba5ec6f/">Maxima and minima</a> with differentiation</h2>
<p>The <a href="/posts/c2ad13d0-6556-40ff-b19a-5b2eeba5ec6f/#global-minima">Global minima</a> of \(y = x^2 + 4x - 5\) is at \(y=-2\). To solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the <a href="/posts/c2ad13d0-6556-40ff-b19a-5b2eeba5ec6f/">Extrema</a></p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\begin{align}
y &amp;= x^2 + 4x - 5 \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp;= 2x + 4 \\
\end{align}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>Now equate to zero&hellip;</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\begin{align}
0 &amp;= 2x + 4 \\
x &amp;= \frac{-4}{2} \\
x &amp;= -2
\end{align}</p>
<p>$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine maxima or minima</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\begin{align}
y &amp;= x^2 + 4x - 5 \\
\frac{d^2y}{(dx)^2} &amp;= 2
\end{align}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>The slope of the slope is positive (\(2 &gt; 0\)), so the <a href="/posts/c2ad13d0-6556-40ff-b19a-5b2eeba5ec6f/">Extrema</a> is a <a href="/posts/c2ad13d0-6556-40ff-b19a-5b2eeba5ec6f/#global-minima">Global minima</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another example with a higher <a href="/posts/b5f2c2d9-50a4-4b20-a32d-c1a9cbb584de/#degree">Degree</a>: \(f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 8x + 1\)</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{4}{3}x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 1 \\
f'(x) &amp;= 4x^2 + 2x - 5
\end{align}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>This has two solutions by the <a href="/posts/9d646383-d4a9-4f9d-ab12-74d45b82d58a/">Quadratic formula</a>:</p>
<p>\(x = -\frac{1}{4} \pm \frac{\sqrt{21}}{4}\)</p>
<p>You can perform the second step from above to determine whether these are maxima or minima.</p>

ROAM_REFS: [cite:@RedblackTree2022] LAST_MODIFIED: [2023-09-19 Tue 16:55] In computer science, a red–black tree is a kind of Self-balancing binary search tree. Each Vertex stores an extra bit representing &amp;ldquo;color&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;), used to ensure that the Tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged [Tree rotation] and &amp;ldquo;repainted&amp;rdquo; to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ID: 019be402-8bef-48f3-afbf-6441010dd8cf</p>

<p>Insertion begins by placing the new (non-<code>NIL</code>) node, say <code>N</code>, at the position in the binary search tree of a <code>NIL</code> node whose in-order predecessor&rsquo;s key compares less than the new node&rsquo;s key, which in turn compares less than the key of its in-order successor. (Frequently, this positioning is the result of a search within the tree immediately preceding the insert operation and consists of a node P together with a direction dir with <code>P-&gt;child[dir] == NIL</code>.) The newly inserted node is temporarily colored red so that all paths contain the same number of black nodes as before.</p>

The purpose of the media spin is to provide a narrative for liberals to latch on to which explains why the United States is doing bad things, engaging with bad people, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nima: The lie is that Biden is meeting with an enemy. He&rsquo;s not.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam: Right. So every three, four years, five years, the President of the United States, going back to since before I was born, they visit Saudi Arabia and they codify a long existing geopolitical relationship in the Middle East. Namely, a few things which we&rsquo;ll go over, which is the US support of Saudi&rsquo;s bombing in Yemen, which is seen as a quote-unquote &ldquo;counter measure&rdquo; against quote-unquote &ldquo;expansionist&rdquo; Iran. That&rsquo;s how they view it. They support, everyone reduces this to oil, and oil is a part of it, but it&rsquo;s much more than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>Adam: In the 17th and 18th century, whenever a royal needed to get a divorce because they hated their wife or they wanted a younger wife or the wife more likely couldn&rsquo;t breed them a male heir, they would have some council of priests come up with, almost always say, &lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re cousins, this is a violation of a taboo against marriage because they&rsquo;re all cousins,&rsquo; right? So this is sort of similar to that where there&rsquo;s this clergy class of reporters who needed to explain why the fist bump was not bad but because, my favorite was Peter Baker — who is the biggest fucking hack in the world — who&rsquo;s a foreign policy for The New York Times wrote, quote, &ldquo;As soon as Biden got out of the car and saw MBS waiting, he immediately put his fist out making clear it would not be a handshake.&rdquo; This is followed by New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard who said, quote, &ldquo;A chilly fist bump with M.B.S. welcomes Biden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nima: &ldquo;Chilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adam: Right.</p>
<p>Nima: &ldquo;Chilly,&rdquo; see Adam.</p>
<p>Adam: A &ldquo;chilly&rdquo; fist bump.</p>
<p>Nima: They&rsquo;re not friends, it was a &ldquo;chilly&rdquo; fist bump.</p>
<p>Adam: Right. And so then you get into this whole thing where everyone&rsquo;s debating whether or not this, you know, about the fist bump, the optics, you know, cozying up to dictators, human rights, that&rsquo;s all bullshit.</p>
<p>Nima: As if the decades long relationship, which is clear as fucking day, is not the actual story here.</p>
<p>Adam: Right and so the fist bump becomes a distraction in a sense, right? It becomes a way of, then the crime is not the selling of the $650 million in arms.</p>
<p>Nima: Right. Then we&rsquo;re just reading fucking tea leaves instead of talking about the real issue.</p>
<p>Adam: Right. And so the big crime really should be the month-long Washington Post investigation, that came out on June 4 of this year, detailing how despite the fact that Biden claimed he was going to end the war in Yemen to much fanfare when he first came in office — obviously, on this show, we said that&rsquo;s probably bullshit, turns out total bullshit — the US has been continuing to support the Saudi bombing of Yemen to this day since Biden&rsquo;s office. So the crime is not that we&rsquo;re supporting their war on Yemen or supporting the blockade of Yemen, although we sort of speak in platitudes about ceasefires and lifting blockades. Fundamentally, they&rsquo;re still giving intelligence support, replacing parts, et cetera. Literally pointing to a map saying this is where you want to, you know, this is where the Houthi rebels are or whatever. The US obviously sells them hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons. None of that&rsquo;s changed. Then there&rsquo;s this whole narrative that, &lsquo;Oh, he had to do it because of Ukraine.&rsquo; There was a Bloomberg headline that read, &ldquo;Soaring Oil Prices Forced Biden to Engage with Saudis He&rsquo;d Spurned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nima: Again, remember, it&rsquo;s not that Biden fundamentally as President of the United States is fine with the relationship with Saudi Arabia because it&rsquo;s an absolutely critical relationship to what US foreign policy is and has been for decades. Biden does not have a problem with this. He is not hand wringing about this. He is not concerned with meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. This is not an issue and yet our media needs it to be this twisted, tough decision to make.</p>
<p>Adam: So from June 3, 2020, &ldquo;Biden forced into Saudi thaw amid rising oil prices.&rdquo; &ldquo;Meeting with Crown Prince would cement U-turn for a US president who labeled kingdom a &lsquo;pariah.'&rdquo; Financial Times — not a U turn at all. Fundamentally, policy never changed.</p>
<p>Nima: Right. Labeling a pariah but doing nothing to create pariah status is not actually making a pariah.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>Adam: [&hellip;] &ldquo;The president&rsquo;s Middle East reset raises human rights concerns for some fellow Democrats. Others are prepared to get pragmatic.&rdquo; So —</p>
<p>Nima: Oh, oh, that&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>Adam: Pragmatic.</p>
<p>Nima: Human rights concerns: niche issue. Pragmatism: reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>Adam: So every single time we do this we get the same hand wringing concerns and part of me is just kind of frustrated by this because I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s the point of this theater? What&rsquo;s the point at this point, in the year of our Lord, Ken Roth has been the head of Human Rights Watch for going on, you know, 35 years or going on 30 years now, right? You&rsquo;d think after Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, Biden all did the exact same trip, they greenlit the exact same weapons deals, they have soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia who then left but then sort of came back. You have the US selling every single Gulf despot from Kuwait to UAE to Saudi Arabia the same spy technology so they can spy on dissidents and lock them up. You have these very cozy business relationships between Saudi Arabia funds Vice media, UAE funds CNN, you would think after these decades of relationships that this is not something that deviates from quote-unquote &ldquo;abandoning principles,&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s actually the principle itself and that once you shred that pretense, again, what replaces it shouldn&rsquo;t be, might makes right nihilism or kind of Kissinger view of the world about power<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it should be okay, well, what would a government that actually cares about human rights both <a href="/posts/7b1f3cd0-2d98-4ebb-8d0b-811fa1cdb310/">negative</a> and <a href="/posts/b1b88ef5-f272-47d7-80c3-de9038e2eeb2/">positive</a>, right? Not just freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, but freedom from poverty, freedom for education, freedom for housing.</p>
<p>Adam: Right. What would that regime look like and is that something we could maybe pressure our government to do or fight for? The sort of classic critique of this arrangement is that allied states, the United States and allied states, are viewed as being, when they commit human rights violations, it&rsquo;s seen as a deviation whereas when human rights are committed by enemy states, they&rsquo;re existential to who they are.</p>
<p>Nima: Right. Fundamental to what those states are all about. They only understand power, they don&rsquo;t care about their people, that&rsquo;s all the stuff that we&rsquo;ve that about on the show like about what these kinds of countries elsewhere deemed to be official US state enemies. They are fundamentally bad and we are fundamentally good.</p>
<p>Adam: Right and we just deviate. Yeah, we need a mild talking to, we need a mild chiding. And so a very infamous version of this was in January of 2015 when King Abdullah died, this is again this sort of worst of the worst human rights violators, this is before the war in Yemen started but we&rsquo;re talking, you know, women can&rsquo;t drive, chopping up dissenters, mass beheadings, oppressive Shia religious intolerance, blah, blah, blah, you name it, they got it, a lot of connections to al Qaeda, which we&rsquo;ll table for another episode. Yeah, Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s headline was, &ldquo;Saudi Arabia: King&rsquo;s Reform Agenda Unfulfilled,&rdquo; and the article said, quote:</p>
<p>King Abdullah&rsquo;s reign brought about marginal advances for women but failed to secure the fundamental rights of Saudi citizens to free expression, association, and assembly. Abdullah&rsquo;s successor, King Salman, should halt persecution of peaceful dissidents and religious minorities…</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, his reform agenda was unfulfilled, right? And contrast this with Hugo Chavez who died about 21 months prior, Human Rights Watch&rsquo;s headline was, &ldquo;Venezuela: Chavez&rsquo;s Authoritarian Legacy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dramatic Concentration of Power and Open Disregard for Basic Human Rights.&rdquo; Throughout the obituary of Chavez he&rsquo;s seen as existential to the regime as human rights abuses whereas Saudi Arabia remains, even though of course, they commit hundreds and hundreds of more human rights abuses than Chavez ever did, Saudi Arabia is seen as having a reform, unironically, said to have a reform agenda, which was simply unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Nima: Reform agenda. It just didn&rsquo;t get to be completed, because the noble reformist died. Oops.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, their dog ate the reform agenda so they had to sort of write it again, it was a whole thing. I mean, this whole thing is so, you realize again, just after years and years and years of this kind of discourse how empty it is, how much it&rsquo;s meant to sort of limit the conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam: Would any New York Times reporter without irony say that scholars of the Middle East claim that it&rsquo;s best that Russia align with Iran and Syria? Because that&rsquo;ll promote good behavior, dissuade, no, you would be laughed out of the room if you said that. But this goofy, childish bullshit that has absolutely no empirical basis, is based on a bunch of racist assumptions, that somehow the US is the human rights Boys and Girls Club, is going to be your mentor, it&rsquo;s going to look after you, it&rsquo;s just going to look after these otherwise kind of restless young countries, and we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re going to guide them to the right path? What the fuck is that? After school special? Saudi Arabia knows what they&rsquo;re doing, we know what they&rsquo;re doing, they&rsquo;ve been doing the same thing for decades, they serve a very specific function, and this idea that we&rsquo;re going to change them from the inside. I mean, it&rsquo;s the height of cynicism and Ben Hubbard is just a total fucking White House flunky, he&rsquo;s a total national security state flunky, is going to just kind of seeing how many the sophistic little ratchet pellets he can shove in his article to so liberals can go, &lsquo;Yeah, well, I guess he&rsquo;s right, I guess we have no choice.&rsquo; So all that hemming and hawing and huffing and puffing over Trump patting dictators on the back and going to Saudi Arabia and doing this, it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;I guess that this is somehow different than that.&rsquo; Well, no, it&rsquo;s not different. Oh, because he did it with a heavy fucking heart.</p>
<p>Nima: Well, because see, this goes back to that sophistry, right? This goes back to the fucking sophistry, Adam, which is Trump did it because he fundamentally agreed with them and he wanted to be like them and he was impressed by dictators, right? But Biden, Biden does it because he just, ah, it&rsquo;s such a bummer, he&rsquo;s so forced, he&rsquo;s going to, he&rsquo;s going to be forced to give a &ldquo;chilly fist bump&rdquo; as opposed to —</p>
<p>Adam: Oh, a &ldquo;chilly fist bump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nima: Right. Here&rsquo;s a chilly fist bump along with your $650 million worth of weapons.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>Nima: [&hellip;] &ldquo;Cut Biden some slack. U.S. presidents have to deal with dictators.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the headline, and in it, Max Boot argues, of course, what you would think which is, you know, hey, this is the way <a href="/posts/8c1b0569-db17-41af-90a3-7f2c75dc8923/">Realpolitik</a> is executed, why is everyone getting so up in arms about this? In the article he writes this, quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, MBS is a more ambivalent figure than the cartoon villain that he is so often made out to be in media coverage. It&rsquo;s true that he is cruel and repressive. He has created a climate of fear in Saudi Arabia, imprisoned dissidents and accumulated absolute power. But, while illiberal politically, he is liberalizing Saudi society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, which he&rsquo;s not, whatever, he&rsquo;s been doing the same reform agenda for, you know, the 250 year Saudi Foreign reform agenda.</p>
<p>Nima: The long game.</p>
<p>Adam: It&rsquo;ll be ready when my great-great grandson.</p>
<p>Nima: That&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;Tourists are welcome for the first time,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;Theaters and concerts have been opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adam: Oh, theaters and concerts. Okay.</p>
<p>Nima: That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. Lord knows that that&rsquo;s the mark of a liberal democracy is bread and circuses that historically —</p>
<p>Nima: That&rsquo;s right. And meanwhile, The Washington Post is publishing this and Jamal Khashoggi, again, who was bone sawed alive by the MBS regime, by, you know, guys carrying this fucking shit out, that is the same outlet that is publishing this shit for Max Boot justifying it.</p>
<p>Adam: Max Boot argues on Twitter that Nixon met with Mao Zedong, FDR met with Stalin blah, blah, blah, and it&rsquo;s like, look, it&rsquo;s true, I actually think that all the anger about the fist bump is a distraction. It&rsquo;s not really the problem.</p>
<p>Nima: Right. The meeting is not the issue. That could be diplomacy. He&rsquo;s not meeting MBS for diplomatic reasons.</p>
<p>Adam: Right. He&rsquo;s meeting with him to talk about increasing the weapons sales that we, the substance of the relationship is the problem, which is supporting and backing the subjugation of dissidents, the bombing of Yemeni, the oppression of women, I mean, you name it, right? The support for sectarianism in the region, blah, blah, blah, which again, I think has geopolitical function for US and Israel. It&rsquo;s not the actual fist bump.</p>
<p>Nima: The lie is that Biden is meeting with an enemy. He&rsquo;s not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed showing behaviours such as crying or screaming. The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant, C1) or helplessness (ambivalent passive, C2) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.</p>

<p>In a reverse cargo cult, you have people who see an airstrip, and the cargo drops, so they build one out of straw. But there&rsquo;s a twist:</p>
<p>When they build the straw airstrip, it isn&rsquo;t because they are hoping for the same outcome. They know the difference, and know that because their airstrip is made of straw, it certainly won&rsquo;t yield any cargo, but it serves another purpose. They don&rsquo;t lie to the rubes and tell them that an airstrip made of straw will bring them cargo. That&rsquo;s an easy lie to dismantle. Instead, what they do is make it clear that the airstrip is made of straw, and doesn&rsquo;t work, but then tell you that the other guy&rsquo;s airstrip doesn&rsquo;t work either. They tell you that no airstrips yield cargo. The whole idea of cargo is a lie, and those fools, with their fancy airstrip made out of wood, concrete, and metal is just as wasteful and silly as one made of straw.</p>
<p>1980s Soviets knew that their government was lying to them about the strength and power of their society, the Communist Party couldn&rsquo;t hide all of the dysfunctions people saw on a daily basis. This didn&rsquo;t stop the Soviet leadership from lying. Instead, they just accused the West of being equally deceptive. &ldquo;Sure, things might be bad here, but they are just as bad in America, and in America people are actually foolish enough to believe in the lie! Not like you, clever people. You get it. You know it is a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Shulman, &ldquo;Cargo-cult is a belief that mock airplanes made of manure and straw-bale may summon the real airplanes who bring canned beef. Reverse cargo-cult is used by the political elites in countries lagging behind who proclaim that, in the developed world, airplanes are also made of manure and straw-bale, and there is also a shortage of canned beef.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lot of the commentators say Moloch represents capitalism. This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?</p>
<p>Moloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis' question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?</p>
<p>And Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. &ldquo;Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Goddess answers: &ldquo;What is the matter with that, if it&rsquo;s what you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaclypse: &ldquo;But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goddess: &ldquo;Oh. Well, then stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: &ldquo;Moloch&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s powerful not because it&rsquo;s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn&rsquo;t an agent.</p>
<p>Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It&rsquo;s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.</p>
<p>So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don&rsquo;t everyone else will kill you, because if they don&rsquo;t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god&rsquo;s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to &ldquo;everyone agrees to stop doing this at once&rdquo;, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.</p>

<h4 id="fish-farming-story">Fish farming story</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As a thought experiment, let&rsquo;s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.</p>
<p>But each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let&rsquo;s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.</p>
<p>A thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.</p>
<p>But one farmer (let&rsquo;s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.</p>
<p>Everyone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he&rsquo;s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.</p>
<p>Once four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying &ldquo;Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone&rsquo;s productivity goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let&rsquo;s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…</p>
<p>A self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.</p>

<h4 id="malthusian-trap">Malthusian trap</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you&rsquo;re one of those rats from <em>The Rats of NIMH</em>).</p>
<p>You live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there&rsquo;s not enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.</p>
<p>A certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back will go extinct within a few generations.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out, swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.</p>
<p>If some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island&rsquo;s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_cycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cycle</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_cycle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating <em>anything</em> is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.</p>
<p>For a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god&rsquo;s-eye-view, it&rsquo;s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.</p>

<h4 id="capitalism">Capitalism</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can&rsquo;t, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="two-income-trap">Two-income trap</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.</p>
<p>From a god&rsquo;s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn&rsquo;t get one will be left behind.</p>

<p>A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don&rsquo;t take it die out. Eventually, everyone&rsquo;s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone&rsquo;s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.</p>

<p>The Apocrypha Discordia says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to be somewhere else when we reach the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take this random gag 100% literally and see where it leads us.</p>
<p>We just analogized the flow of incentives to the flow of a river. The downhill trajectory is appropriate: the traps happen when you find an opportunity to trade off a useful value for greater competitiveness. Once everyone has it, the greater competitiveness brings you no joy – but the value is lost forever. Therefore, each step of the Poor Coordination Polka makes your life worse.</p>
<p>But not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move uphill surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons – excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization – plus one good reason – coordination.</p>

<p>The ocean depths are a horrible place with little light, few resources, and various horrible organisms dedicated to eating or parasitizing one another. But every so often, a whale carcass falls to the bottom of the sea. More food than the organisms that find it could ever possibly want. There&rsquo;s a brief period of miraculous plenty, while the couple of creatures that first encounter the whale feed like kings. Eventually more animals discover the carcass, the faster-breeding animals in the carcass multiply, the whale is gradually consumed, and everyone sighs and goes back to living in a Malthusian death-trap.</p>

<p>Imagine a profit-maximizing slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves' productivity dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor – we assume the fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can – but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how mean you can get away with being. Thus, the &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; stops somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits are run into.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>So in this case, a race to the bottom where competing plantations become crueler and crueler to their slaves in order to maximize competitiveness is halted by the physical limitation of cruelty not helping after a certain point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been thinking in terms of preserving values versus winning competitions, and expecting optimizing for the latter to destroy the former.</p>
<p>But many of the most important competitions / optimization processes in modern civilization are optimizing for human values. You win at capitalism partly by satisfying customers' values. You win at democracy partly by satisfying voters' values.</p>
<p>Suppose there&rsquo;s a coffee plantation somewhere in Ethiopia that employs Ethiopians to grow coffee beans that get sold to the United States. Maybe it&rsquo;s locked in a life-and-death struggle with other coffee plantations and want to throw as many values under the bus as it can to pick up a slight advantage.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t sacrifice quality of coffee produced too much, or else the Americans won&rsquo;t buy it. And it can&rsquo;t sacrifice wages or working conditions too much, or else the Ethiopians won&rsquo;t work there. And in fact, part of its competition-optimization process is finding the best ways to attract workers and customers that it can, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t cost them too much money. So this is very promising.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to remember exactly how fragile this beneficial equilibrium is.</p>
<p>Suppose the coffee plantations discover a toxic pesticide that will increase their yield but make their customers sick. But their customers don&rsquo;t know about the pesticide, and the government hasn&rsquo;t caught up to regulating it yet. Now there&rsquo;s a tiny uncoupling between &ldquo;selling to Americans&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfying Americans' values&rdquo;, and so of course Americans' values get thrown under the bus.</p>
<p>Or suppose that there&rsquo;s a baby boom in Ethiopia and suddenly there are five workers competing for each job. Now the company can afford to lower wages and implement cruel working conditions down to whatever the physical limits are. As soon as there&rsquo;s an uncoupling between &ldquo;getting Ethiopians to work here&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfying Ethiopian values&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t look too good for Ethiopian values either.</p>
<p>Or suppose someone invents a robot that can pick coffee better and cheaper than a human. The company fires all its laborers and throws them onto the street to die. As soon as the utility of the Ethiopians is no longer necessary for profit, all pressure to maintain it disappears.</p>
<p>Or suppose that there is some important value that is neither a value of the employees or the customers. Maybe the coffee plantations are on the habitat of a rare tropical bird that environmentalist groups want to protect. Maybe they&rsquo;re on the ancestral burial ground of a tribe different from the one the plantation is employing, and they want it respected in some way. Maybe coffee growing contributes to global warming somehow. As long as it&rsquo;s not a value that will prevent the average American from buying from them or the average Ethiopian from working for them, under the bus it goes.</p>
<p>I know that &ldquo;capitalists sometimes do bad things&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it&rsquo;s not equivalent to &ldquo;capitalists are greedy&rdquo;. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they&rsquo;re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn&rsquo;t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter.</p>
<p>(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very well and people who summarize him as &ldquo;capitalists are greedy&rdquo; are doing him a disservice)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it&rsquo;s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there&rsquo;s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus.</p>
<p>For example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling to do anything about them because they don&rsquo;t want to look &ldquo;soft on crime&rdquo;, and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all over the airwaves as &ldquo;Convict released by Congressman&rsquo;s policies kills family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone claim he deserves reelection?&rdquo;. So even if decreasing prison populations would be good policy – and it is – it will be very difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Things are easy to solve from a god&rsquo;s-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse. An intense competition between agents has turned into a garden, with a single gardener dictating where everything should go and removing elements that do not conform to the pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] government can easily solve the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races within a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it&rsquo;s easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there&rsquo;s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren&rsquo;t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I agree with Robin Hanson: This is the dream time. This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and science and philosophy and love can flourish.</p>
<p>As technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus' unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn&rsquo;t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.</p>

<p>And the whole point of Bostrom&rsquo;s Superintelligence is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they&rsquo;ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift something to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it&rsquo;s on our side, it can kill Moloch dead.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names. In the Kushiel books, his name was Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of niceness, community, and civilization. He is a god of humans.</p>
<p>The other gods sit on their dark thrones and think &ldquo;Ha ha, a god who doesn&rsquo;t even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a surprising number of unfortunate accidents.</p>

<p>The question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?</p>

<p>He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power.</p>
<p>As long as the offer&rsquo;s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.</p>

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes (a). That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo; (a).

Summary Thoughts Notes A senior person demonstrates technical leadership by creating the processes that other people can follow, thereby enabling delegation and multiplying their effectiveness. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to work out the procedure for replacing a bad disk on a server, but they document it in a way that less experience people can do the task. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to set up a massive monitoring system, but they document how to add new devices so that everyone can add to what is monitored.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/d2129f29-f3a1-4e10-8a25-25ae81b949a5/">Tom Limoncelli</a>, (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Limoncelli n.d.</a>)</p>

<p>A senior person demonstrates technical leadership by creating the processes that other people can follow, thereby enabling delegation and multiplying their effectiveness. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to work out the procedure for replacing a bad disk on a server, but they document it in a way that less experience people can do the task. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to set up a massive monitoring system, but they document how to add new devices so that everyone can add to what is monitored. Therefore they multiply their effectiveness because they use their knowledge not to do work, but to make it possible that an army of people can do the work instead. Good documentation is the first step to automating a process, so by working out the process, they start the &ldquo;guess work -&gt; repeatable -&gt; automated&rdquo; life-cycle that repetitive tasks should follow.</p>
<p>The old way is to maintain your &ldquo;status&rdquo; by hoarding information. You are the only person that knows how to do things and that is your power base. The new way is you maintain your &ldquo;status&rdquo; by sharing information. Everyone looks up to you because it is your documentation that taught them how to do their job. As they learn by following documentation that you wrote they get better at what they do and soon they are senior too. However now you are the senior person that helped everyone get to where they are today. In terms of corporate status, there is nothing better than that!</p>

<p>Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet to-day inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another therefore is to oppose Nature, and to be vexed with another or to turn away from him is to tend to antagonism.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate the use of phrases, mantras, hymns, etc &mdash; <a href="/posts/15909524-30d0-41ae-88b2-767e6c996d66/">focusing techniques</a>  &mdash; as a way of focusing the mind or returning to a particular state of mind. It reminds me of the <a href="/posts/458de7df-08ff-40dc-9a7b-18f2d14520ee/">Litany Against Fear</a> or the <a href="/posts/749f3b30-7a42-4262-9175-f9b2046557ec/">Serenity Prayer</a>, and more broadly of <a href="/posts/9032f4f9-c2f4-4af5-9f69-4840c3bbbce8/">A Beginning</a>. This one seems particularly important as it is almost <a href="/posts/f3ce6cfc-d119-4903-94db-9a2e2d4397e0/">by default</a> that I see myself as distinct from those around me. Oh, what isolation that brings.</p>

<li>Examples
<ul>
<li>If your goal is to make money by selling clothing, then a non-goal could be &ldquo;make the best quality clothing&rdquo;. You could, instead, focus on branding or marketing while producing low-quality clothing.</li>
<li>If your goal is to pass a class, then a non-goal would be to write the best essay. You need only write a good-enough essay such that you pass the class.</li>
<li>If your goal is getting promoted, then a non-goal would be doing each project to perfection. A better strategy may be to do a few things to 80% rather than one thing to 100%.</li>

<li>Greedy algorithms</li>
<li>Local, rather than global, maxima</li>
<li>Unwritten rules or, perhaps another way of stating it, the penumbra of the rule set</li>
<li>As an extension: Play to win doesn&rsquo;t have to imply that you&rsquo;re trying to win for winning&rsquo;s sake. It is also reasonable to incorporate play to win strategies to serve a larger goal &ndash; a goal that you set. Play to win strategies do not defin what &ldquo;winning&rdquo; is &ndash; only you do. Yes, &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; playstyles can win the match but perhaps you&rsquo;re not trying to win the match but rather trying to win a loyal following or aclaim. Scrub playstyles, in these situations, may be sub-optimal. Play to win only requires you to identify the optimal strategies within the rule set, written or un-written, and employ those in pursuit of your goal.</li>

Many activities in Knowledge work (a) seem to be ephemeral efforts, their outputs mostly discarded after they&amp;rsquo;re completed.
You might wake up to a really tricky email and realize that it connects to something you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a while. You might spend an hour writing a careful reply, capturing your latest thinking. And now&amp;hellip; it lives in your &amp;ldquo;sent&amp;rdquo; folder, and briefly in the impression on your and your colleague&amp;rsquo;s mind.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/posts/df479fb9-f7b0-4e3a-a7eb-41849fbc190e/">Andy Matuschak</a>, (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Matuschak n.d.</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many activities in <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2eKzbL5nwQrm8Zr26rtaLHXyKHREr3tm5HbY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge work</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2eKzbL5nwQrm8Zr26rtaLHXyKHREr3tm5HbY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) seem to be ephemeral efforts, their outputs mostly discarded after they&rsquo;re completed.</p>
<p>You might wake up to a really tricky email and realize that it connects to something you&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a while. You might spend an hour writing a careful reply, capturing your latest thinking. And now&hellip; it lives in your &ldquo;sent&rdquo; folder, and briefly in the impression on your and your colleague&rsquo;s mind. The effort accumulates only insofar as that work subtly influences your and your colleague&rsquo;s thinking over time.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2ZAGQBHuJ2u9WrtAQHAEHcCZTtqpsGkAsrD1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most people take only transient notes</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2ZAGQBHuJ2u9WrtAQHAEHcCZTtqpsGkAsrD1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>), though with effective practices, they&rsquo;re an essential foundation; see <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>).</p>
<p>We should strive to design practices systems which yield compounding returns on our efforts as they accumulate over time.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spaced repetition memory system</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>) achieves this for memory: when you find information useful, you can invest a little effort to make sure you always have it available. Over time, one&rsquo;s spaced repetition library accumulates thousands of questions, and (I strongly suspect) that knowledge makes it easier to be an effective knowledge worker later.</p>
<p>Hamming illustrates this point vividly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode&rsquo;s office and said, &ldquo;How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, &ldquo;You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.&rdquo; I simply slunk out of the office!</p>
<p>What Bode was saying was this: &ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.&rdquo; [<a href="/posts/92cf48f0-63a6-4d1d-9275-c80f6743ccb9/">Do things that compound</a>] Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don&rsquo;t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode&rsquo;s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write more completely about these things later. The goal for this writing session is only to get them down and out of my head. They are listed in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only work on things that matter. Things that matter can be defended and argued to others; ideally with hard numbers. Be cautious about investing into projects that cannot be argued with numbers. Taking a closer look at the numbers around search keyboard usage may have led me to invest less in a technically complex keyboard solution (Kabu).</li>
<li>Verify assumptions/expectations as early as possible. Get an experiment out there to confirm the things you think will happen as soon as possible. What is the minimum viable product? Build that and send it out. Confirm, with numbers, that the thing you want to build is worth building. Write your assumptions down throughout the duration of the project, especially at the beginning, and track them. How and when will you test them?</li>
<li>Under promise and over deliver. Pad estimates. Be cautious when agreeing to deadlines. The unexpected always happens.</li>
<li>Break projects down. Then break them down more. Trim all of the fat and get to MVP as soon as you can. From there, ensure steady and meaningful deliverables.</li>
<li>Coding should be more typing than thinking. Design a solution away from the computer, then return and type it up.</li>
<li>Document everything. Specifically, document what you do and the status of your projects. You&rsquo;ll forget more than you ever know so write it down. I have come to like this process: write down the important things you do on a daily basis, summarize those at the end of the week, summarize those every month. Then, in addition to those notes, keep a set of notes specific to each project you&rsquo;re working on. These project notes should include an up-to-date-at-all-times timeline of events and should include references to everything related to the project. This is more than you would ever send to someone but that&rsquo;s not what it is for. This document is the bible for the project. It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll pull from whenever you&rsquo;re asked any question about the project from now until the end of time. Put time on your calendar to keep these documents up to date.</li>
<li>Communicate regularly with stakeholders. Keep in mind that your audience dictates the way you present information. I&rsquo;ve found through trial and error that a bi-weekly update is sufficient for most projects. More often than that and it&rsquo;s difficult to make meaningful progress enough to make the update worthwhile to write. That said, it may be useful to send something brief to your immediate team every week, or update them in a meeting.</li>
<li>Communicate delays or other changes to the plan as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from my Keep notepad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to other teams before your invest time and effort to be sure they haven&rsquo;t already fixed the problem</li>
<li>Find a single point of contact (tl, etc) on collaborating teams. Send them docs for easily review. Proactively communicate. It&rsquo;s your job to surface things and ask questions, it&rsquo;s not their job to think of your questions for you. Or, rather, you can&rsquo;t assume they will do you should act like they won&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t enter into a project without a good understanding of the benefits in a numeric sense. Kabu is, potentially, a massive 5 quarter long project which will introduce additional download times for our users and provide little in tangible benefits.</li>
<li>Communicate especially when you feel too stressed to communicate. Take notes and document especially when you feel like there&rsquo;s no time to. Adhere to all the good engineering habits especially when you feel like you&rsquo;ll get them first thing on Monday when you get back.</li>
<li>When feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to go for a quick walk and when you&rsquo;re done with the walk write down the things that need to be done. Now that it certain down, does it feel as overwhelming? Is there any way to shorten the list by making concessions or cutting features? Can you reach out to anybody on the team to help you prioritize the list?</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from another Keep note:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much mayonnaise is in the jar? Meaning, to borrow another saying, how large is the market. The same hour of effort has different results based on the project it&rsquo;s applied to. Understand what the payout stands to be for anything you&rsquo;re working on.</li>
<li>Think about your project from the perspective of an l7 who couldn&rsquo;t give less of a shit. Can you convince them, with something concrete, to give a shit about the project?</li>
<li>Rapid iteration beats coding in a tower for 6 months. Get to experiment quickly with a hack to prove that the real version is worth the effort.</li>
<li>Think metrics first.</li>
<li>Write up a step by step guide to evaluating projects and working on them. Include this shit so I won&rsquo;t forget it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from a Keep note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly reviewing existing code when coming into extend an existing project. Don&rsquo;t assume it&rsquo;s bug free. Don&rsquo;t assume it&rsquo;s written well. Don&rsquo;t assume the engineers who wrote it adhered to best practices or designed it in an extensible way. Don&rsquo;t assume there are tests of any kind (unit, integration, end-to-end).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritize <a href="/posts/82d1d3b6-dd55-43bf-828e-b34508ac136c/">Deep work</a></p>
<p>I realized when writing this that the whole lot of it is the same as what&rsquo;s posted all over the internet. The only difference is that these words mean more to me because I bled to learn them. It makes me wonder how much value there really is in seeking out advice online.</p>
<p>2019-08-20</p>
<ul>
<li>Only work on things that have buy in from L+1, ideally L+2 or L+3. Things that higher ups are going to be judged against are going to be the things that they are motivated to invest in. Ideally, they&rsquo;re success should depend on your success. This will ensure they make sure you succeed without you needing to do extra maneuvering.</li>

I thought about this in the context of citations needed episode 166. They discuss education specifically. It&rsquo;s propagandisement as a great equalizer. Pursuing an education is a fantastic individual strategy to increase earning potential. However, systemically, one cannot say that everything can be solved by giving people more education. That is definitely part of a solution. More education is a great thing after all. However, the episode focuses on the rhetoric around providing education as a panacea against poverty, where it is one of many things that need to be done to alleviate poverty. It is the twisting of something that&rsquo;s a great idea for an individual, however, is not wholly representative of a good systemic strategy.</h2>

<li>A phrase I see brought to bear more and more, and overwhelmingly regarding culture war topics. The big one, in my mind at least, used to be creationism and the Big Bang – that schools should teach both as equally powerful and correct.</li>
<li>Often wrong; only one side has merit.</li>
<li>Though not a phase at the time I first heard the phrase, the underlying rationale maps cleanly onto &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo;. Cultural matters aren&rsquo;t math insofar as there isn&rsquo;t an objective right answer. We live in a cold universe after all. However, we can make our part of the universe warm (related, moloch and gardens). We can decide that slavery (yes I&rsquo;m going for the emotionally resonant examples because I find that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re used with most often) is abhorrent.</li>
<li>Related to &ldquo;This is a matter for the states&rdquo; only when a nation-wide federal/judicial-level policy isn&rsquo;t possible.</li>
<li>Related to &ldquo;The science/jury is still out&rdquo;; we&rsquo;re right, so if the evidence doesn&rsquo;t bear that out then we clearly aren&rsquo;t fine collecting evidence and arguing – especially arguing.</li>

Partly because the employee could go elsewhere for that kind of thing because it is now in Vogue. However, it is in Vogue because a happy employee who identifies with the company who is spiritually fulfilled produce more than employees who lack these things. And it isn&rsquo;t a small magnifying effect. It&rsquo;s a huge magnifying effect. The employees, the knowledge workers, are the asset of the company. Maintaining their mental and spiritual health is the new form of mechanization or offshoring. This kind of thing will be dropped the moment it becomes unprofitable, as moloch demands. 22:00 <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjAwNzgzNTY2L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTI2NjcxNzI3MQ?ep=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjAwNzgzNTY2L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTI2NjcxNzI3MQ?ep=14</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2022*/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjAwNzgzNTY2L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTI2NjcxNzI3MQ?ep=14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a</a>)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve engaged with their writing as much as I have because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their posts have introduced me to concepts and ways of thinking I hadn&rsquo;t previously known about</li>
<li>Their writing style is enjoyable to read, for me at least. It feels conversational.</li>
<li>They came broadly recommended by groups I had previously frequented (e.g. hackernews)</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I want to emphasize both that (1) my enjoyment of <em>some</em> of their work doesn&rsquo;t imply that I agree with their <em>entire</em> body of work and (2) I don&rsquo;t identify with the community they broadly fit into (Rationalists; related: <a href="/posts/820021b3-7576-4516-9fe2-51cbfe263ebe/">LessWrong</a>). I&rsquo;d say this is true for everything I document in this notebook. The authors I&rsquo;ve found which appear to sit beneath the &ldquo;Rationalist&rdquo; banner have been the source of a lot of good learning for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an apprentice at the Leach Pottery in 1964 and 1965, I helped produce a line of standard ware shapes. I remember vividly the moment when I realized that I was not learning shapes but processes, and that the way a thing is made and its appearance are one and the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="wondrous">Wondrous</h4>
<h4 id="the-space-within">The Space Within</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The assignment is to make a cylinder, somewhat taller than it is wide, that suggests the greatest possible internal empty space for the given amount of clay. It is the suggestion of space we are concerned with, not the measurable space. The goal is to create an internal space whose lively presence speaks for itself. Slight modulations of the silhouette are permissible, as are variations in treatment of the bottom and top edges of the wall of the pot. Do not think of this as a completed pot, and do avoid bulky rim shapes. If you are doing this assignment in a group, you should all use the same amount of clay.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>The task was to make a cylinder. The word &ldquo;pot&rdquo; was not used in order to keep the emphasis on the goal of maximum internal space and to avoid the natural desire to make an object that could be judged and found good. Cylinders are often viewed as a sort of warm-up exercise before &ldquo;real&rdquo; pots are made, but cylinders are real pots capable of all the complexity of use and aesthetics as other shapes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="beginnings-and-endings">Beginnings and Endings</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The assignment is rims and bases. Wedge up a few pounds of clay and throw as many different kinds of rims as you can devise. Cut each rim off the cylinder, save it, and then throw another. The term rim can apply to a simple, undifferentiated top edge as well as an articulated or protruded terminating shape. Practice variations of bottom edge shapes with separate lemon-size balls of clay, pulling up just enough of the wall to show how it would grow out of the chosen bottom edge treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>The variation in results of this exercise will be greater among people than within the output of any one person. The individual tends to gravitate to similar increments of clay no matter what the shapes. This tendency should be a choice, not an unconscious habit. Remember that just because you are trying to throw thinner and thinner walls does not mean that the top and bottom edges inevitably have to be thin also.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cylinders-as-pots">Cylinders as Pots</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The third assignment is to throw a cylinder that is not just a throwing exercise but a finished pot—a cylinder with a personality and a story to tell. It can be simple or complex, a bit concave or convex, punctuated with subtle or strong beginnings and endings.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>Of particular interest to the beginner is the ability to create a shape in which the clay is well distributed throughout the walls of the pot, not only in fact but in terms of the impression it makes. Remember that in the throwing of a vertical form the right hand is dominant. The inside hand acts only as a firm support to counter the strong inward tapering pull of the outside hand. After the cylinder reaches full height, the inside hand can play more of a part in the shaping.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>The cause of round-bottomed pots is a failure to open up a wide enough floor with crisp right-angled corners before pulling up the walls (figure 44).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/ox-hugo/a-potters-workbook-figure-44.png">Figure 44</a></p>
<h4 id="pitchers">Pitchers</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It is time to move on to a specific utilitarian form. The assignment is to make pitchers. Use at least two pounds of clay or more, and keep it simple. Do not make forms that will require turning or trimming, but think in terms of cylindrically derived shapes. Remember that this is an incomplete form, as it will have a handle and a spout added after it is thrown.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>A useful notion for analyzing pitchers comes from Warren MacKenzie. He says pitchers have two parts: a part that contains and a part that delivers the contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<p>If you remember the [arm-like] quality of a handle, you will be in no doubt where to attach it. The handle begins at the point corresponding to a shoulder and ends on the part suggesting a hip. The arm spans an arc between shoulder and hip in just the same way it does on our bodies. And so, too, does the handle span the containing and delivering parts of the form.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="bowls">Bowls</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Bowls require a complete change of tactics, so clear your mind before tackling them. The assignment is to make bowls with simple open curves. Leave about an inch of unformed clay at the bottom of the bowls to allow for choices of height, width, and shape of turned feet. Use about four pounds of clay.</p>

<p>For example, knowing that London is in the United Kingdom is a piece of explicit knowledge; it can be written down, transmitted, and understood by a recipient. In contrast, the ability to speak a language, ride a bicycle, knead dough, play a musical instrument, or design and use complex equipment requires all sorts of knowledge which is not always known explicitly, even by expert practitioners, and which is difficult or impossible to explicitly transfer to other people.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition is how I bring intention to memory. I remember the things I choose to remember, rather than only the things I happen to remember. It aids in making learning and memory conscious, effortful, process.</p>
<p>Note <a href="/posts/75f5bb46-04f2-4fdd-ae12-db9607773b98/">The difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something</a>. Spaced repetition is capable of aiding both remembering names and deeper understanding. However, the two require different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember something when prompted (e.g. knowing the definition of a word while reading)</li>
<li>Bring an idea to mind in context (e.g. using a word while writing)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s most effective when the practice mirrors, as closely as is possible, the way the knowledge will be applied (see also <a href="/posts/89eb6adc-d8f8-4033-bc46-7fed725c3c01/">Desirable difficulty</a>).</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>My preferred solution is <a href="/posts/4be26817-4ffd-4975-97aa-deda536235a5/">org-fc</a>. However, <a href="/posts/6472f018-ab80-4c73-b973-adb8417939db/">Anki</a> is, as far as I can tell, the most popular and well known. I used Anki exclusively prior to switching to org-fc.</p>
<h2 id="why-isn-t-spaced-repetition-more-popular">Why isn&rsquo;t spaced repetition more popular?</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, from my own experience and reading what others have written on the topic:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not popular because it isn&rsquo;t popular</p>
<p><a href="/posts/3bac7cee-9146-45df-be28-bb51ac48be68/">People are not strategic by default</a> and aren&rsquo;t likely to go out on their own to pursue novel (to them at least) ways of doing something. They&rsquo;re much more likely to do what they see others doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other, more popular, learning methods work well enough</p>
<p>Spaced repetition isn&rsquo;t the only effective way to learn a topic. Additionally, those alternatives often feel better in the moment or give the impression that they&rsquo;re more effective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, [cramming] is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can&rsquo;t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I&rsquo;m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?⁠</p>
<p>Because it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak⁠12⁠.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! [&hellip;]</p>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Branwen 2009</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to write good, effective, cards</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason this can be frustrating is you&rsquo;ll often remember a flashcard for the first few weeks of it (when you&rsquo;re seeing it with high frequency), but after a couple of months, you start failing it. It didn&rsquo;t take root in your long term memory, because it was poorly written in some way. And this long feedback cycle means it takes time to acquire these skills through trial and error.</p>
