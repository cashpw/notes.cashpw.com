The productivity tiers seem to be:
&amp;lt;10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness. Byrne Hobart
“50%+ focus” is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It’s when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower.</description></item><item><title>Be Impatient</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/be_impatient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 11:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/be_impatient/</guid><description>Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There’s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you’re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total. But I don’t think that’s the main reason that speed is important.</description></item></channel></rss>
