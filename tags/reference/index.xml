This is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.
Summary I hate mondays is an embrace of coping strategies and a refusal to address a problem stemming from the belief that the problem is unfixable.

Summary Conservatives tend to think in hierarchies &amp;ndash; like a capitalist &amp;ndash; while liberals tend to think democratically &amp;ndash; like an egalitarian.
Thoughts Notes See, when you talk to your conservative friend, you operate as though you have the same base assumptions: belief in democracy, &amp;ldquo;do unto others,&amp;rdquo; etc. etc. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t believe your friend shared these assumptions, you&amp;rsquo;d basically be calling him a fascist or a sadist.</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | The Card Says Moops</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskincardsaysmoops2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 08:25:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskincardsaysmoops2019/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2019)
This is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.
Summary Performative irony (see For the lulz) for the dual goals of winning arguments and obfuscating your true beliefs. That is, pretending (and possibly believing, at least at some level) that you just want to watch the world burn and the hiding, from others and yourself, the fact that you only ever seem to go after the Left and what the targets of your ire imply about your underlying beliefs.</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | You Go High, We Go Low</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskinyougohighwegolow2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 08:11:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskinyougohighwegolow2018/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:danskinYouGoHighWeGoLow2018)
This is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.
Summary Going low is a manifestation of playing to win &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a focus on the ends justifying the means. It works most effectively when opposed by a group which holds the means as sacred and would rather not focus on the ends.
Thoughts Notes You can play this as keeping your integrity, the Democrats seizing the moral high ground.</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | The Death of a Euphemism</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskindeatheuphemism2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 20:19:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskindeatheuphemism2018/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2018)
This is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.
Summary Politicians only let a euphemism die when they don&amp;rsquo;t need it anymore.
[&amp;hellip;]
To the Far Right, a euphemism is like a calf: something to be brought into this world or inherited, removed from its original context, raised to adolescence, and then slaughtered when the time is right. Historically, the first sign that things are about to get a lot worse for minorities is when the racism stops being euphemistic.</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | The Ship of Theseus</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskinshiptheseus2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskinshiptheseus2018/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2018)

Summary Thoughts Notes [&amp;hellip;] two of the most powerful tools for making any marginalized group less marginalized are Language and Visibility.
[&amp;hellip;]
[&amp;hellip;] as a fringe group becomes more visible, and their language becomes commonplace, their presence in society starts to seem normal. They become demystified.

Summary You can convince an audience that you&amp;rsquo;re winning an argument, or at least plant doubts in their head, by holding an offensive posture.

It&amp;rsquo;s primary focus is on building a common language to describe patterns he, and others, observe in the alt-right.
While Danskin hasn&amp;rsquo;t formally proposed solutions or a counter-playbook, I have extracted some ideas from the Alt-right Playbook:
Speak directly to your audience; don&amp;rsquo;t validate terrible ideas by platforming them to your audience or by debating/etc Imagine others complexly Pursue egalitarian policies and structures of governance Prefer the Duck test to believing people at their word</description></item><item><title>Ian Danskin | Control the Conversation</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskincontrolconversation2017/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/danskincontrolconversation2017/</guid><description>Ian Danskin, (Danskin 2017)
This is an entry in the Alt-right Playbook.
Summary Broadly, controlling the conversation is about making people talk about what you want them to talk about. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s about what you make them talk about. Structure debate, conversation, etc, based on the idea that the goal is to win. Move the goalposts while also redefining the rules by which you win the underlying game.
Thoughts Notes [&amp;hellip;] every one of these bad arguments is a subtle attempt to change the subject.</description></item><item><title>Scott Alexander | I Can Tolerate Anything Except The Outgroup</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexandercantolerateanythingoutgroup2014/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 20:41:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/alexandercantolerateanythingoutgroup2014/</guid><description>Scott Alexander, (NO_ITEM_DATA:alexanderCanTolerateAnythingOutgroup2014)

Once upon a time, the planet was tyrannised by a giant dragon. The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil smelling yellowish green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon tyrant lived.</description></item><item><title>James F.

VIRGINIA BEACH, VA—In the hours following a violent rampage in Virginia in which a lone attacker killed 12 individuals and injured four others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Wednesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. &amp;ldquo;This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing anyone can do to stop them,&amp;rdquo; said Michigan resident Mark Butler, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world&amp;rsquo;s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations.</description></item><item><title>Robin Hanson | The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hansonageemworklovelifewhenrobotsruleearth2016/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 09:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/hansonageemworklovelifewhenrobotsruleearth2016/</guid><description>Robin Hanson, (NO_ITEM_DATA:hansonAgeEmWorkLoveLifeWhenRobotsRuleEarth2016)

Summary Programs, obviously, hold all of these properties. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally 3 architypes of programmers, divided by which ideals we hold in highest esteem:

Summary If I had to sum all these up, it would be this: raise kids for the long term. The reasoning behind all these choices is that we want to produce competent capable adults, and solving short term in-the-moment issues, while important, isn&amp;rsquo;t the goal.

Summary You&amp;rsquo;re more likely to hear things you agree with or that are, broadly speaking, aligned with your world-view. Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to over-index on a certain flavor of advice. You may benefit from considering the reverse of the piece of advice.
Thoughts A simple bit of metacognitive advice which I&amp;rsquo;d like to integrate into my daily life.

If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about how ideas relate to each other (see Understanding requires effortful engagement and Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented). It&amp;rsquo;ll also help you internalize the ideas more deeply through Elaborative encoding.

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That&amp;rsquo;s because these practices aren&amp;rsquo;t about writing notes; they&amp;rsquo;re about effectively developing insight: &amp;ldquo;Better note-taking&amp;rdquo; misses the point; what matters is &amp;ldquo;better thinking&amp;rdquo;. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.</description></item><item><title>Tom Limoncelli | What Makes a Sysadmin a Senior Sysadmin?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncelliwhatmakessysadminseniorsysadmin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncelliwhatmakessysadminseniorsysadmin/</guid><description>Tom Limoncelli, (NO_ITEM_DATA:limoncelliWhatMakesSysadminSeniorSysadmin)
Summary Thoughts Notes A senior person demonstrates technical leadership by creating the processes that other people can follow, thereby enabling delegation and multiplying their effectiveness. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to work out the procedure for replacing a bad disk on a server, but they document it in a way that less experience people can do the task. Maybe the senior person is the only one technical enough to set up a massive monitoring system, but they document how to add new devices so that everyone can add to what is monitored.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | Metagaming</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/metagaming2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/metagaming2021/</guid><description>(“Metagaming” 2021)
Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.
Metagaming might also refer to a game which functions to create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.</description></item><item><title>Tom Limoncelli | The Right Answer</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncellirightanswer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/limoncellirightanswer/</guid><description>Tom Limoncelli, (Limoncelli n.d.)

Summary Thoughts Notes In order not to confuse titles with expectations that are fuzzy, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to engineering maturity.
Meaning: I expect a &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; engineer to be a mature engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to gloss over the part where one could simply list the technical areas in which a mature engineer should have some level of mastery or understanding (such as &amp;ldquo;Networking&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Filesystems&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, etc.) and instead highlight the personal characteristics that in my mind give me indication that someone can influence an organization or a business positively in the domain of engineering.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Trapped in the Technologist Factory</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmantrappedtechnologistfactory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 09:32:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmantrappedtechnologistfactory/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (Tellman n.d.)
Summary Thoughts Notes I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand the context around your software, I&amp;rsquo;m happiest when that context is other people&amp;rsquo;s software.
The second lesson was broader, and less obvious: our industry is designed to foster people like me.</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Senior Engineers Reduce Risk</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanseniorengineersreducerisk/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (NO_ITEM_DATA:tellmanSeniorEngineersReduceRisk)
Summary Thoughts Notes Senior engineers reduce risk, in every sense. Often, &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; is used to describe technical risk, which is that the software doesn&amp;rsquo;t function properly, or is never completed at all. But there are other issues that can prevent the business atop the software from succeeding - risks around process, or product design, or sales, or the company&amp;rsquo;s culture. A senior engineer understands these risks, and mitigates them where possible.</description></item><item><title>Wikipedia | And Yet It Moves</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/itmoves2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/itmoves2022/</guid><description>(“And yet It Moves” 2022)
&amp;ldquo;And yet it moves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Although it does move&amp;rdquo; (Italian: E pur si muove or Eppur si muove) is a phrase attributed to the Italian mathematician, physicist and philosopher Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) in 1633 after being forced to recant his claims that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than the converse. In this context, the implication of the phrase is: despite his recantation, the Church&amp;rsquo;s proclamations to the contrary, or any other conviction or doctrine of men, the Earth does, in fact, move (around the Sun, and not vice versa).</description></item><item><title>Zach Tellman | Thought Leaders and Chicken Sexers</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanthoughtleaderschickensexers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:25:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/tellmanthoughtleaderschickensexers/</guid><description>Zach Tellman, (NO_ITEM_DATA:tellmanThoughtLeadersChickenSexers)

Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals.

Summary Thoughts Notes It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how fast you move if it&amp;rsquo;s in a worthless direction. Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.
The most impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in the general population.

Duncan Sabien sometimes talks about &amp;ldquo;lotus-eating&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s referring to a part of the Odyssey where they land on an island of &amp;ldquo;lotus-eaters&amp;rdquo;. It turns out that once you eat some of this kind of lotus, all you want to do is eat more. You stop caring about your other goals. The lotus just grabs your wants directly.
The idea of noticing the taste of lotus is closely related to mindfulness and attention.</description></item><item><title>Alexey Nikitin | My least favorite Git commit</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nikitinmyleastfavoritegitcommit2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/nikitinmyleastfavoritegitcommit2019/</guid><description>Alexey Nikitin, (NO_ITEM_DATA:nikitinMyLeastFavoriteGitCommit2019)

Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention.

Summary A useful essay is one which is novel, correct, important, and strong:
A novel essay communicates a &amp;ldquo;new thing&amp;rdquo; (point of view, fact, opinion, etc) to at least some of its audience. A correct essay is factually accurate; insofar as is possible. An important essay matters to at least some people.

Summary Thoughts Notes Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.
There&amp;rsquo;s an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you&amp;rsquo;re 10% more productive, you will finish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work total.
