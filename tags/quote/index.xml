You just won&amp;rsquo;t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it&amp;rsquo;s a long way down the road to the chemist&amp;rsquo;s, but that&amp;rsquo;s just peanuts to space.

But I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, national media outlets are publishing these same fake stories without checking facts first. Unfortunately, some members of the national media are using their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control &amp;lsquo;exactly what people think&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Serenity Prayer</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/serenity_prayer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 07:19:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/serenity_prayer/</guid><description> God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference.</description></item><item><title>Litany Against Fear</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/litany_against_fear/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 07:03:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/litany_against_fear/</guid><description> I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.

Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.
Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences.</description></item><item><title>Once Revealed to Me in a Dream</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/once_revealed_to_me_in_a_dream/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 12:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/once_revealed_to_me_in_a_dream/</guid><description> This was once revealed to me in a dream.

For example When I do sets I make 2-4-6 of the same shape/size/color. They started out being cousins, then became sisters, now they are twins. Knowing I can form a shape with intention was important to me. It strengthened my skill.
BUT there is a place for &amp;lsquo;form-finding&amp;rsquo; which I think describes how you made these shapes you are showing us.</description></item><item><title>The First Lesson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</guid><description> Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
