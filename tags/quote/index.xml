There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.

For example When I do sets I make 2-4-6 of the same shape/size/color. They started out being cousins, then became sisters, now they are twins. Knowing I can form a shape with intention was important to me. It strengthened my skill.
BUT there is a place for &amp;lsquo;form-finding&amp;rsquo; which I think describes how you made these shapes you are showing us.</description></item><item><title>The First Lesson</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/the_first_lesson/</guid><description>Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;rsquo;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;rsquo;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
