&amp;hellip; [R]elational processing refers to the encoding of similarities and differences across pieces of information. For example, sorting words into categories, ordering sentences to create a coherent text, and explaining why each subsequent step in a science experiment follows the preceding step all involve comparing to-be-remembered events to each other.

Item-specific processing involves encoding the various characteristics or properties of a particular piece of information. For example, judging the pleasantness of a word, filling in missing letters in a text, and creating a mental image of each step in a science experiment all focus the learner on a single to-be-remembered item.

A common example would be using tests as a tool for study. The student has to attempt to recall the information from memory while taking the test and thereby improves their recall.</description></item><item><title>Memory in Educational Settings</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/memory_in_educational_settings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 10:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/memory_in_educational_settings/</guid><description>Summary Retrieval or re-experiencing a memory will increase retention. Studying should be somewhat difficult; neither too difficult that the subject is unable to overcome the challenge, nor too easy. The difficulty is a desirable feature of the process of studying in that the difficulty improves retention. One does not need to be aware of the specific benefits of a study method to benefit from them. The way you learned a piece of information as well as the cues/environment during retrieval control your ability to remember and utilize information.</description></item><item><title>Spaced Repetition</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spaced_repetition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spaced_repetition/</guid><description> Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.</description></item><item><title>Spacing Effect</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spacing_effect/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:26:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/spacing_effect/</guid><description> The spacing effect demonstrates that learning is more effective when study sessions are spaced out.</description></item><item><title>Desirable Difficulty</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/desirable_difficulty/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:13:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/desirable_difficulty/</guid><description>A desirable difficulty is a learning task that requires a considerable but desirable amount of effort, thereby improving long-term performance.
Examples include:
Retrieval practice (eg: flashcards) Spacing and interleaving (eg: Spaced Repetition) To determine whether a difficulty is desirable, use the following three guidelines:
The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing at retrieval. The processing at encoding should be the same as the processing during practice.</description></item><item><title>Ask HN: How do you learn complex, dense technical information?</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ask_hn_how_do_you_learn_complex_dense_technical_information/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 12:41:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/ask_hn_how_do_you_learn_complex_dense_technical_information/</guid><description>Notes Essentially I think learning is fundamentally Pain. You have to take on the pain before the learning can alleviate it, if you try to skip the pain then you have only a superficial idea of what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about.

Interestingly there is a concept in learning research called &amp;ldquo;desirable difficulty&amp;rdquo;. The idea is that learning something, forgetting it and then struggling to learn it again leads to faster learning times.</description></item></channel></rss>
