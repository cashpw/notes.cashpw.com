For example When I do sets I make 2-4-6 of the same shape/size/color. They started out being cousins, then became sisters, now they are twins. Knowing I can form a shape with intention was important to me. It strengthened my skill.
BUT there is a place for &amp;lsquo;form-finding&amp;rsquo; which I think describes how you made these shapes you are showing us.</description></item></channel></rss>
