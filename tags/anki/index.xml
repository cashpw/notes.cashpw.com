Anki is flashcard software that integrates spaced repetition and active recall testing. I found creating cards, as well as managing existing cards, was easier after creating custom note types to represent specific information.
Most of my cards include a common field: Source. I like to keep track of where I found the information that went into the card, be that Wikipedia or a textbook or otherwise.</description></item></channel></rss>
