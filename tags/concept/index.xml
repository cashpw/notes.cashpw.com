Even the best maps are imperfect. That&amp;rsquo;s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists.

[&amp;hellip;]
The name LISP derives from &amp;ldquo;LISt Processor&amp;rdquo;. Linked lists are one of Lisp&amp;rsquo;s major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.</description></item><item><title>Atom</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/atom/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/atom/</guid><description>An atom, in Lisp, is an indivisible thing.

Numbers (e.g. 12) Strings (e.g. foo) Symbols (e.g. + or 'pi) This term comes from the historical meaning of the word atom, which means &amp;ldquo;indivisible&amp;rdquo;.

Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.</description></item><item><title>Priority queue</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/priority_queue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/priority_queue/</guid><description>In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue [Queue] or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a &amp;ldquo;priority&amp;rdquo; associated with it.

First, it lowers the barrier for writing something. Instead of worrying about whether you can write enough about whatever it is you want to write about, just write, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it turns out short.
Second, it makes reading things easier.
