Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf&amp;rsquo;s a flower;
But only so an hour.
The leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day,
Nothing gold can stay.
Robert Frost, (“Nothing Gold Can Stay (Poem)” 2022)

Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;
Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree</description></item><item><title> Emily Dickinson | "Hope" is the thing with feathers</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b0f01042-9128-4189-a344-033496d5ce24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:11:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/b0f01042-9128-4189-a344-033496d5ce24/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Hope&amp;rdquo; is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -
And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -</description></item><item><title>Emily Dickinson | Tell all the truth but tell it slant</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/af1ca7da-bebf-4161-8162-057cae4a0951/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 07:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/af1ca7da-bebf-4161-8162-057cae4a0951/</guid><description>Tell all the truth but tell it slant —
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth&amp;rsquo;s superb surprise
As Lightning to the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind —
Emily Dickinson, (Dickinson 2022)

I I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,</description></item><item><title>Percy Bysshe Shelley | Ozymandias</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7aa8dfb5-3aba-45b6-a6b5-0e718403d237/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 18:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/7aa8dfb5-3aba-45b6-a6b5-0e718403d237/</guid><description>I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: &amp;ldquo;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:</description></item><item><title>Litany Against Fear</title><link>http://cashweaver.com/posts/458de7df-08ff-40dc-9a7b-18f2d14520ee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 07:03:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://cashweaver.com/posts/458de7df-08ff-40dc-9a7b-18f2d14520ee/</guid><description>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
Bene Gesserit, Herbert | Dune</description></item></channel></rss>
