      <description> Muad&amp;#39;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&amp;#39;s shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad&amp;#39;Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
